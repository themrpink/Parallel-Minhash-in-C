The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as &quot;Champions League&quot;, was written by [[Tony Britten]], and is an adaptation of [[George Frideric Handel]]'s 1727 anthem ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' (one of his [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|Coronation Anthems]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CL Anthem&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAQDxYxQDU8C&amp;pg=PA129 |title=Media, democracy and European culture|publisher=Intellect Books|page=129|date=2009|accessdate=14 September 2014|isbn=9781841502472}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and sung by the [[Academy of St. Martin in the Fields]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CL Anthem&quot;/&gt; Stating &quot;the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy&quot;, UEFA's official website adds it is &quot;known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CL Anthem&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=UEFA Champions League anthem |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/022d-0e1636f1244a-c916aa410dad-1000--champions-league-anthem/ |accessdate=12 May 2020 |agency=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UEFA Champions League entrance music |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz0nhZfbhLQ |website=YouTube |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music&quot;/&gt;

Special vocal versions have been performed live at the [[Champions League Final]] with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by [[Andrea Bocelli]] (Italian) ([[2009 UEFA Champions League Final|Rome 2009]], [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final|Milan 2016]] and [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|Cardiff 2017]]), [[Juan Diego Flores]] (Spanish) ([[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|Madrid 2010]]), [[All Angels]] ([[2011 UEFA Champions League Final|Wembley 2011]]), [[Jonas Kaufmann]] and [[David Garrett (musician)|David Garrett]] ([[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|Munich 2012]]), and [[Mariza]] ([[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|Lisbon 2014]]). In the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final|2013 final]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], the chorus was played twice. In the [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final|2018]] and [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final|2019]] finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by [[2Cellos]] (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2Cellos to perform UEFA Champions League anthem in Kyiv |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2559940.html |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=17 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asturia Girls to perform UEFA Champions League anthem in Madrid |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2606194.html |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 May 2019 |accessdate=19 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on [[iTunes]] and [[Spotify]] with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] remixed the anthem with rapper [[Vince Staples]] for EA Sports' video game ''[[FIFA 19]]'', with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Music: Champions League Anthem Remix with Hans Zimmer|url=https://www.easports.com/fifa/news/2018/hans-zimmer-champions-league-remix|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=12 June 2018|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding==
In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help &quot;brand&quot; the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, &quot;house colours&quot; of black and white or silver and a logo, and the &quot;starball&quot;. The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.&lt;ref&gt;King, Anthony. (2004). The new symbols of European football. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport 39''(3). London, Thousand Oaks, CA, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, &quot;Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem&quot;. Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, &quot;the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;TEAM. (1999). ''UEFA Champions League: Season Review 1998/9''. Lucerne: TEAM.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UEFA Champions League begins with a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage of 32 teams, which since the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|2009–10 season]] is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd–4th in their national championship.

The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.

Four of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.

In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.

In [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petržalka akadémia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. In [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|2008–09 season]], both [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] and [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC|Anorthosis Famagusta]] achieved the same feat. Real Madrid and FC Barcelona hold the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times in a row (1997–present). They are followed by FC Porto and FC Bayern on 24 (1997–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/EuroExperience/competitions/Publications/02/28/56/88/2285688_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=The official website for European football&amp;nbsp;– UEFA.com|accessdate=29 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.

An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4613695.stm|title=Liverpool get in Champions League|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=10 June 2005|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=index |title=EXCO approves new coefficient system |publisher=UEFA |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archive-date=21 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521053931/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind%3D64/newsid%3D698237.html?cid=rssfeed&amp;att=index |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] finished fourth in the [[2011–12 Premier League]], two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|2012–13 Champions League]], after Chelsea won the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|2012 final]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurs_Chelsea&quot;/&gt; Tottenham were demoted to the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurs_Chelsea&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Redknapp and Spurs given bitter pill of Europa League by Chelsea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/20/harry-redknapp-spurs-europa-league|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=20 May 2012|accessdate=24 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.&lt;ref name=2015AccessExplained&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kassiesa.net/uefafiles/2015-18-uefa-access-list-explanations.pdf|title=UEFA Access List 2015/18 with explanations|publisher=Bert Kassies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Michel Platini]], the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/11/13/sfnuef113.xml|title=Clubs force UEFA's Michel Platini into climbdown|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 November 2007|accessdate=2 December 2007|first=David|last=Bond}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7090646.stm|title=Platini's Euro Cup plan rejected|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Arsène Wenger]] referred to qualifying for the Champion's League by finishing in the top four places in the English [[Premier League]] as the &quot;4th Place Trophy&quot;. The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the [[FA Cup]]. He said &quot;The first trophy is to finish in the top four&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/19/arsene-wenger-arsenal-fourth-place | title =Arsène Wenger says Champions League place is a 'trophy' | newspaper =Guardian | accessdate = 15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: &quot;For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://talksport.com/magazine/virals/121026/picture-arsenals-trophy-cabinet-redesigned-include-new-fourth-place-trop-183898| title =Arsenal's Trophy Cabinet| publisher =Talk Sport | accessdate = 15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group stage and knockout phase===
[[Image:Real Madrid-Milan free kick 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[A.C. Milan]]’s [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] surrounded by [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] defenders during a Champions League group stage game in 2010]]
The tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.&lt;ref name=&quot;CL Format&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Champions League explained |url=https://www.premierleague.com/uefa-champions-league-explained |accessdate=16 January 2020 |website=PremierLeague.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seed (sports)|Seeding]] is used whilst making the draw for this stage, whilst teams from the same nation may not be drawn into groups together. Each team plays six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.&lt;ref name=&quot;CL Format&quot;/&gt; The winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the next round. The third-placed team enters the [[UEFA Europa League]].

For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, and teams from the same association may not be drawn against each other. From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw is entirely random, without association protection. The tournament uses the [[away goals rule]]: if the aggregate score of the two games is tied, then the team who scored more goals at their opponent's stadium advances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/63/02/44/1630244_DOWNLOAD.pdf &quot;Regulations of the UEFA Champions League 2011/12, pg 10:&quot;]. UEFA.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group stage is played from September to December, whilst the knock-out stage starts in February. The knock-out ties are played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. The final is typically held in the last two weeks of May, or in the early days of June, which has happened in three consecutive odd-numbered years since [[2015 UEFA Champions League Final|2015]]. In [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League|2019–20 season]], due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] the tournament was suspended for five months, with the final taking place in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=573698|title=Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain to win Champions League|publisher=ESPN|date=23 August 2020|accessdate=23 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League and/or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues.
*If the Champions League title holders qualify for the group stage via their domestic league, the champions of association 11 (Austria in 2019/2020) will enter the group stage, and champions of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds will also be promoted accordingly.
*If the Europa League title holders qualify for the group stage via their domestic league, the third-placed team of association 5 (France) will enter the group stage, and runners-up of the highest-ranked associations in the second qualifying round will also be promoted accordingly.
*If the Champions League and/or Europa League title holders qualify for the qualifying rounds via their domestic league, their spot in the qualifying rounds is vacated, and teams of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds will be promoted accordingly.
*An association may have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefa1819&quot;/&gt; Therefore, if both the Champions League and Europa League title holders come from the same top-four association and finish outside of the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of the league will not compete in the Champions League and will instead compete in the Europa League.

==Referees==
===Ranking===
The UEFA Refereeing Unit is broken down into five experience-based categories. A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.&lt;ref name=&quot;referees&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UEFA Referee|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/protecting-the-game/refereeing/|date=7 July 2010|publisher=Uefa.com|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment===
In co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;referees&quot;/&gt;

===Limitations===
Since 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test to even be considered at the international level.&lt;ref name=&quot;referees&quot;/&gt;

===Trophy and medals===
{{main|European Champion Clubs' Cup}}
[[File:Trofeo UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|Official trophy]]
Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.&lt;ref name=&quot;trophy&quot;/&gt; Each time a club achieved this a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19071.pdf Regulations of the UEFA Champions League]'' ([[PDF]]) from UEFA website;  Page 4, §2.01 &quot;Cup&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Champion Clubs' Cup#Clubs awarded the trophy permanently|Five clubs own a version of the official trophy]]: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.&lt;ref name=&quot;trophy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How UEFA honours multiple European Cup winners|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2478341.html|website=uefa.com|accessdate=25 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.&lt;ref name=&quot;trophy&quot;/&gt;

The current trophy is {{convert|74|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and made of silver, weighing {{convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from [[Bern]], Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 [[Swiss franc]]s.

As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/79/68/69/1796869_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=2012/13 Season|work=Regulations of the UEFA Champions League: 2012–15 Cycle|publisher=UEFA|page=8|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prize money===
As of 2019–20, the fixed amount of prize money paid to the clubs is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/stakeholders/clubs/news/newsid=2616265.html|title=2019/20 UEFA club competitions revenue distribution system
|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com|language=en|access-date=11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Preliminary qualifying round: €230,000
*First qualifying round: €280,000
*Second qualifying round: €380,000
*Third qualifying round: €480,000 (Only for clubs eliminated from the champions path, since clubs eliminated from the league path qualify directly for the UEFA Europa League group stage and therefore benefit from its distribution system.)
*Base fee for group stage: €15,250,000
*Group match victory: €2,700,000
*Group match draw: €900,000
*Round of 16: €9,500,000
*Quarter-finals: €10,500,000
*Semi-finals: €12,000,000
*Runner-ups: €15,000,000
*Champions: €19,000,000

This means that, at best, a club can earn €82,450,000 of prize money under this structure, not counting shares of the qualifying rounds, play-off round or the market pool.

A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the &quot;market pool&quot;, the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2014–15 season, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], who were the runners-up, earned nearly €89.1&amp;nbsp;million in total, of which €30.9&amp;nbsp;million was prize money, compared with the €61.0&amp;nbsp;million earned by Barcelona, who won the tournament and were awarded €36.4&amp;nbsp;million in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2015|title=Clubs benefit from Champions League revenue|journal=Uefadirect|issue=1|page=1|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/General/02/29/45/25/2294525_DOWNLOAD.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[FIFA World Cup]], the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Craig|last2=Magnus|first2=Ems|date=February 2003|title=The Uefa Champions League Marketing|journal=Fiba Assist Magazine|pages=49–50|url=http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528155330/http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only one sponsorship is permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer. Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/01/75/63/78/1756378_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=UEFA Kit Regulations Edition 2012|publisher=[[UEFA]]|pages=37, 38|accessdate=29 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If clubs play a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's [[alcohol advertising]] restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] played French sides [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] and [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] in the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|1996–97 Champions League]] and the [[1996–97 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], respectively, Rangers players wore the logo of [[Center Parcs Europe|Center Parcs]] instead of [[McEwan's|McEwan's Lager]] (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of [[Scottish &amp; Newcastle]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Alternative to alcohol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecoloursfootballkits.com/articles/an-alternative-to-alcohol|title=An alternative to alcohol|work=truecoloursfootballkits.com|publisher=True Colours|date=3 July 2009|last=Devlin|first=John|accessdate=5 June 2013|quote=Rangers have actually sported the Center Parcs logo during the course of two seasons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Passage of an object through the gases of an atmosphere from outer space}}
{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}
[[Image:Entry.jpg|thumb|[[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) [[aeroshell]], artistic rendition]]
'''Atmospheric entry''' is the movement of an object from [[outer space]] into and through the gases of an [[atmosphere]] of a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[natural satellite]]. There are two main types of atmospheric entry: uncontrolled entry, such as the entry of [[astronomical object]]s, [[space debris]], or [[bolide]]s; and controlled entry (or reentry) of a spacecraft capable of being navigated or following a predetermined course. Technologies and procedures allowing the controlled atmospheric '''entry, descent, and landing''' of spacecraft are collectively termed as '''EDL'''.

[[Image:Meteoroid meteor meteorite.gif|Animated illustration of different phases as a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere to become visible as a meteor and land as a meteorite|thumb|right]]
Objects entering an atmosphere experience [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], which puts mechanical stress on the object, and [[aerodynamic heating]]—caused mostly by compression of the air in front of the object, but also by drag. These forces can cause loss of mass ([[ablation]]) or even complete disintegration of smaller objects, and objects with lower [[compressive strength]] can explode.

Crewed space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or air brakes may be deployed. Such vehicles have kinetic energies typically between 50 and 1,800 megajoules, and atmospheric dissipation is the only way of expending the kinetic energy. The amount of rocket fuel required to slow the vehicle would be nearly equal to the amount used to accelerate it initially, and it is thus highly impractical to use [[retrorocket|retro rockets]] for the entire Earth reentry procedure. While the high temperature generated at the surface of the [[heat shield]] is due to [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic compression]], the vehicle's kinetic energy is ultimately lost to gas friction (viscosity) after the vehicle has passed by. Other smaller energy losses include [[black-body radiation]] directly from the hot gases and chemical reactions between ionized gases.

Ballistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at reentry, and in fact, are made streamlined so as to maintain their speed. Furthermore, slow-speed returns to Earth from near-space such as [[Free fall#Record free fall parachute jumps|parachute jumps from balloons]] do not require heat shielding because the gravitational acceleration of an object starting at relative rest from within the atmosphere itself (or not far above it) cannot create enough velocity to cause significant atmospheric heating.

For Earth, atmospheric entry occurs by convention at the [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{Convert|100|km|mi nmi|abbr=in}} above the surface, while at [[Venus#Atmospheric entry|Venus atmospheric entry]] occurs at {{Convert|250|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} and at [[Mars atmospheric entry]] at about {{Convert|80|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}}. Uncontrolled objects reach high velocities while accelerating through space toward the Earth under the influence of Earth's [[gravity]], and are slowed by friction upon encountering Earth's atmosphere. Meteors are also often travelling quite fast relative to the Earth simply because their own orbital path is different from that of the Earth before they encounter Earth's [[gravity well]]. Most controlled objects enter at [[hypersonic]] speeds due to their [[sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] (e.g., [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]), or [[hyperbolic trajectory|unbounded]] (e.g., [[meteor]]s) trajectories. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative low-velocity method of controlled atmospheric entry is [[buoyancy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpaerospace.com/atohandout.pdf |title=ATO: Airship To Orbit |publisher=JP Aerospace}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity, or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of [[Venus]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and the [[gas giant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unmanned Spacecraft Meeting 1965|first=F.|last=GROSS|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/6.1965-1407|chapter=Buoyant Probes into the Venus Atmosphere|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Blunt body reentry shapes.png|thumb|Early reentry-vehicle concepts visualized in [[Schlieren photography|shadowgraph]]s of [[high speed wind tunnel]] tests]]
The concept of the ablative [[heat shield]] was described as early as 1920 by [[Robert Goddard]]: &quot;In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as {{convert|30|mi}} per second, the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface. For this reason, if the outer surface of the apparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between, the surface would not be eroded to any considerable extent, especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not be nearly so great as that of the average meteor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goddard|first=Robert H.|title=Report Concerning Further Developments|date=Mar 1920|url= http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddardmarch1920.htm|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date= 2009-06-29| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090626145252/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddardmarch1920.htm| archive-date= 26 June 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical development of reentry systems began as the range and reentry velocity of [[ballistic missiles]] increased. For early short-range missiles, like the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet [[R-5 Pobeda|R-5]], with a {{convert|1200|km|nmi|sp=us|adj=on|abbr=off}} range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry). The first [[ICBM]]s, with ranges of {{convert|8000|to|12000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=on}}, were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.

In the United States, this technology was pioneered by [[H. Julian Allen]] and [[Alfred J. Eggers|A. J. Eggers Jr.]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) at [[Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Boris Chertok, &quot;Rockets and People&quot;, NASA History Series, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, they made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/sp4305.htm |last=Hansen |first=James R. |date=Jun 1987 |title=Engineer in Charge: A History of the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, 1917–1958 |series=The NASA History Series |volume=sp-4305 |chapter=Chapter 12: Hypersonics and the Transition to Space |chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm
|publisher=United States Government Printing |isbn=978-0-318-23455-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the [[drag coefficient]]; i.e., the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot &quot;get out of the way&quot; quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle). Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.

The Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;

==Terminology, definitions and jargon==
Over the decades since the 1950s, a rich technical jargon has grown around the engineering of vehicles designed to enter planetary atmospheres. It is recommended that the reader review the [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of atmospheric reentry|jargon glossary]] before continuing with this article on atmospheric reentry.

When atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery, particularly on a planetary body other than Earth, entry is part of a phase referred to as ''entry, descent, and landing'', or EDL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501326main_TA09-EDL-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from, the event is referred to as '''reentry''' (almost always referring to Earth entry).

The fundamental design objective in atmospheric entry of a spacecraft is to [[Dissipation|dissipate]] the &lt;!-- kinetic plus potential --&gt;[[Mechanical energy|energy]] of a spacecraft that is traveling at [[hypersonic speed]] as it enters an [[planetary atmosphere|atmosphere]] such that equipment, cargo, and any passengers&lt;!-- using &quot;passengers&quot; rather than &quot;crew&quot; as, increasingly after 2020, we are seeing a transition in spacecraft designs for vastly more passengers than crew --&gt; are slowed and land near a specific destination on the surface at zero velocity while keeping stresses on the spacecraft and any passengers within acceptable limits.&lt;ref name=nasa197203&gt;
{{cite conference |last=Graves|first=Claude A. |last2=Harpold|first2=Jon C. |title=Apollo Experience Report - Mission Planning for Apollo Entry |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720013191.pdf |conference=NASA Technical Note (TN) D-6725 |date=March 1972 |quote=''The purpose of the Apollo entry maneuver is to dissipate the energy of a spacecraft traveling at high speed through the atmosphere of the earth so that the flight crew, their equipment, and their cargo are returned safely to a preselected location on the surface of the earth. This purpose must be accomplished while stresses on both the spacecraft and the flight crew are maintained within acceptable limits.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be accomplished by [[propulsion|propulsive]] or [[Drag (physics)|aerodynamic]] (vehicle characteristics or [[parachute]]) means, or by some combination.

==Entry vehicle shapes==
{{Main|Aeroshell}}
{{see also|Nose cone design}}
There are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles:

===Sphere or spherical section===
[[Image:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo command module]] flying with the blunt end of the [[heat shield]] at a non-zero [[angle of attack]] in order to establish a lifting entry and control the landing site (artistic rendition)]]
The simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Przadka|first1=W.|last2=Miedzik|first2=J.|last3=Goujon-Durand|first3=S.|last4=Wesfreid|first4=J.E.|title=The wake behind the sphere; analysis of vortices during transition from steadiness to unsteadiness.|url=http://sphere.meil.pw.edu.pl/publi/AoM_60_2008_6.pdf|website=Polish french cooperation in fluid research.|publisher=Archive of Mechanics., 60, 6, pp. 467–474, Warszawa 2008. Received May 29, 2008; revised version November 13, 2008.|access-date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody. The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory. Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay-Riddell equation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fay-Riddell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fay |first1=J. A. |last2=Riddell |first2=F. R. |title=Theory of Stagnation Point Heat Transfer in Dissociated Air |journal=Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences |volume=25 |pages=73–85 |date=February 1958 |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/TOCPDFs/36_373-386.pdf |format=PDF Reprint |access-date=2009-06-29 |issue=2 |doi=10.2514/8.7517 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107202757/http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/TOCPDFs/36_373-386.pdf |archive-date=2005-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicle's center of mass is upstream from the center of curvature (dynamic stability is more problematic). Pure spheres have no lift. However, by flying at an [[angle of attack]], a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and [[computational fluid dynamics]] was still embryonic. Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.

Pure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] [[space capsule|capsule]]s and in Soviet Mars and [[Venera]] descent vehicles. The [[Apollo command module]] used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical afterbody. It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of −27° (0° is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690029435_1969029435.pdf Hillje, Ernest R., &quot;Entry Aerodynamics at Lunar Return Conditions Obtained from the Flight of Apollo 4 (AS-501),&quot; NASA TN D-5399, (1969).]&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant lift achieved a measure of cross-range control by offsetting the vehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry, allowing the lift force to be directed left or right by rolling the capsule on its [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|longitudinal axis]]. Other examples of the spherical section geometry in manned capsules are [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]]/[[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Project Mercury|Mercury]]. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak [[g-force]], reducing it from 8–9&amp;nbsp;g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4–5&amp;nbsp;g, as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittington|first1=Kurt Thomas|title=A Tool to Extrapolate Thermal Reentry Atmosphere Parameters Along a Body in Trajectory Space|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6817/1/etd.pdf|website=NCSU Libraries Technical Reports Repository|publisher=A thesis submitted to the Graduate Faculty of North Carolina State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Aerospace Engineering Raleigh, North Carolina 2011, pp.5|access-date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sphere-cone===
The sphere-cone is a spherical section with a [[frustum]] or blunted cone attached. The sphere-cone's dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section. The vehicle enters sphere-first. With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of mass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to surface impact. (The ''half-angle'' is the angle between the cone's axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the cone's surface edges.)

[[Image:Mk 2.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype of the Mk-2 Reentry Vehicle (RV), based on blunt body theory.]]
The original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), which was developed in 1955 by the [[General Electric]] Corp. The Mk-2's design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article). The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower [[ballistic coefficient]] and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to [[radar]]. These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. Consequently, an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

This new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS, a nylon phenolic. This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3,360&amp;nbsp;kg, a length of 3.1 m and a half-angle of 12.5°. Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6. Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10° to 11°.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Reconnaissance satellite]] RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the first American example of a non-munition entry vehicle ([[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer-I]], launched on 28 February 1959). The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g., [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'']] probe. Unlike with military RVs, the advantage of the blunt body's lower TPS mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the [[Galileo Probe]] with a half-angle of 45° or the [[Viking program|Viking aeroshell]] with a half-angle of 70°. Space exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

===Biconic===
[[File:Delta Clipper DC-X first flight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The DC-X, shown during its first flight, was a prototype [[single stage to orbit]] vehicle, and used a biconic shape similar to AMaRV.]]
The [[biconic]] is a sphere-cone with an additional frustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the ''Advanced [[Maneuverable reentry vehicle|Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle]]'' (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs were made by the [[McDonnell Douglas]] Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman-1 ICBMs]] on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470&amp;nbsp;kg, a nose radius of 2.34&amp;nbsp;cm, a forward-frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6&amp;nbsp;cm, aft-frustum half-angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Frank J. and Anadakrishnan, Satya M., &quot;Dynamics of Atmospheric Re-Entry&quot;, AIAA Education Series, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|1-56347-048-9}}, (1993).&lt;!-- I think this refers to diagrams of simulations on pg. 268 &amp; 269. Is there a way to note that? ([https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=1563470489 Google Books]) --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a ''split-windward flap'') along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides. [[Hydraulic machinery|Hydraulic actuation]] was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) interception. The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]].

===Non-axisymmetric shapes===
Non-[[axisymmetric]] shapes have been used for manned entry vehicles. One example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a [[delta wing]] for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This approach has been used by the American [[Space Shuttle]] and the Soviet [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]]. The [[lifting body]] is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the [[X-23 PRIME]] (Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Reentry heating==
[[File:Space Shuttle reentry aboard flight deck.jpg|thumb|Cabin view of the [[Space Shuttle]] during [[STS-42]] re-entry. Due to the compression and friction of the air, the molecules generate a very hot plasma which glows in the red-orange spectrum.]]
Objects entering an atmosphere from [[outer space|space]] at high velocities relative to the atmosphere will cause very high levels of [[heat flux|heating]]. Reentry heating comes principally from two sources:&lt;ref name=nasa201401/&gt;
  
* [[Convective heat transfer|convective heating]], of two types:
** hot gas flow past the surface of the body and 
** [[catalytic]] [[chemical recombination reaction]]s between the object surface and the atmospheric gases 
*[[Thermal radiation|radiative heating]], from the energetic [[Shock wave|shock layer]] that forms in front and to the sides of the object

As velocity increases, both convective and radiative heating increase. At very high speeds, radiative heating will come to quickly dominate the convective heat fluxes, as convective heating is proportional to the velocity cubed, while radiative heating is proportional to the velocity exponentiated to the eighth power. Radiative heating—which is highly [[wavelength]] dependent—thus predominates very early in atmospheric entry while convection predominates in the later phases.&lt;ref name=nasa201401&gt;

===Shock layer gas physics ===
At typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both [[ionized]] and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]].{{citation needed | date=September 2016}} This chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layer's thermal and chemical properties. There are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields:

====Perfect gas model====
Almost all aeronautical engineers are taught the [[Ideal gas|perfect (ideal) gas model]] during their undergraduate education. Most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Equations, tables, and charts for compressible flow |publisher=NASA Technical Reports |issue=NACA-TR-1135 |year=1953 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/734673main_Equations-Tables-Charts-CompressibleFlow-Report-1135.pdf |journal=NACA Annual Report |volume=39 |pages=613–681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from NACA Report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.

The perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft but assumes that the gas is chemically inert. From the standpoint of aircraft design, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than 550 K at one atmosphere pressure. The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and is not usable at temperatures greater than 2,000 K. For temperatures greater than 2,000 K, a heat shield designer must use a ''real gas model''.

====Real (equilibrium) gas model====
An entry vehicle's pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo command module and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling. The Apollo-CM's trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor. The actual aerodynamic center of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects. On ''Columbia''{{'}}s maiden flight ([[STS-1]]), astronauts [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]] had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Iliff and Mary Shafer, ''Space Shuttle Hypersonic Aerodynamic and Aerothermodynamic Flight Research and the Comparison to Ground Test Results'', Page 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

An equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called ''[[thermodynamic equilibrium]]''). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions. Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from [[isentropic process|isentropic]] heating of the air molecules within the compression wave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating.{{original research inline|date=November 2013}} The distance from the shock wave to the [[stagnation point]] on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called ''shock wave stand off''. An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach [[chemical equilibrium]] in a shock layer for a 7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s entry into air during peak heat flux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and ''not'' in a state of equilibrium. The [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of atmospheric reentry#F|Fay-Riddell equation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fay-Riddell&quot;/&gt; which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure. For example, in the case of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] probe's entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39&amp;nbsp;km/s during peak heat flux).

Determining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the ''ratio of specific heats'' (also called ''isentropic exponent'', [[adiabatic index]], ''gamma'', or ''kappa'') is assumed to be constant along with the [[gas constant]]. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the ''isentropic chain''. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a ''Mollier diagram'' would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the ''Gibbs free energy method''. [[Gibbs free energy]] is simply the total [[enthalpy]] of the gas minus its total [[entropy]] times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a [[Newton-Raphson method]] is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition functions]]. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program ''Chemical Equilibrium with Applications'' (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed &quot;NASA Glenn Research Center&quot;). Other names for CEA are the &quot;Gordon and McBride Code&quot; and the &quot;Lewis Code&quot;. CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K ([[double ionization]] is not modelled). [https://web.archive.org/web/20200205195610/https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ CEA can be downloaded from the Internet] along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the [[GNU Fortran|G77 Fortran]] compiler.

====Real (non-equilibrium) gas model====
A non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer's gas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model. {{asof|1958}}, the simplest non-equilibrium model was the ''Lighthill-Freeman model''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lighthill |first=M.J. |title=Dynamics of a Dissociating Gas. Part I. Equilibrium Flow |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=2 |pages=1–32 |date=Jan 1957 |doi=10.1017/S0022112057000713 |issue=1|bibcode = 1957JFM.....2....1L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=N.C. |title=Non-equilibrium Flow of an Ideal Dissociating Gas |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=4 |pages=407–425 |date=Aug 1958 |doi=10.1017/S0022112058000549 |issue=4|bibcode = 1958JFM.....4..407F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lighthill-Freeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic species susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse; e.g., N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ? N + N and N + N ? N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (dissociation and recombination). Because of its simplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is unfortunately too simple for modelling non-equilibrium air. Air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen, 0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon. The simplest real gas model for air is the ''five species model'', which is based upon N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, N, and O. The five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide.

When running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program,{{clarify|date=August 2018}} the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate. With a non-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas. The five species model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas). The Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation. The five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Because the 5 ordinary differential equations are tightly coupled, the system is numerically &quot;stiff&quot; and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for entry from [[low Earth orbit]] where entry velocity is approximately {{cvt|7.8|km/s|km/h mph}}. For lunar return entry of 11&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;!-- 36545 ft/s in NASA 1960s units --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690029435.pdf Entry Aerodynamics at Lunar Return Conditions Obtained from the Fliigh of Apollo 4], Ernest R. Hillje, NASA, TN: D-5399, accessed 29 December 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen. The five-species model is no longer accurate and a twelve-species model must be used instead.
Atmospheric entry interface{{clarify|what does the term &quot;entry interface&quot; mean?  It seems to be nowhere explicated on Wikipedia.|date=December 2019}} velocities on a Mars–Earth [[orbital trajectory|trajectory]] are on the order of {{Cvt|12|km/s|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080023907.pdf Overview of the Mars Sample Return Earth Entry Vehicle], NASA, accessed 29 December 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modeling high-speed Mars atmospheric entry—which involves a carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon atmosphere—is even more complex requiring a 19-species model.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

An important aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux. If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating. Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., [[cyanogen]] (CN), [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]] (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen etc. These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species. The newly formed [[diatomic]] molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|vibrational energy]] into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux. The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge. The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady [[Schrödinger equation]] are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering. Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program. Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's success. However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Frozen gas model====
The frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium. The name &quot;frozen gas&quot; can be misleading. A frozen gas is not &quot;frozen&quot; like ice is frozen water. Rather a frozen gas is &quot;frozen&quot; in time (all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped). Chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules. If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium. However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop. For that situation the gas is considered frozen.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, [[viscosity]] etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Thermal protection shield]] (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Thermal protection systems==
{{Main|Heat shield#Spacecraft}}
{{split section|Thermal protection system (reentry vehicle)|date=November 2020}}
A '''thermal protection system''', or TPS, is the barrier that protects a [[spacecraft]] during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. A secondary goal may be to protect the spacecraft from the [[Solar constant|heat]] [[Thermal radiation|and]] [[Outer space#Environment|cold]] of space while in orbit. Multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among them ablative heat shields, passive cooling, and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces.

===Ablative===
[[File:Apollo 12 heat shield.JPG|thumb|left|Ablative heat shield (after use) on [[Apollo 12]] capsule]]
The [[Ablation|ablative]] heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler [[boundary layer]]). The boundary layer comes from ''blowing'' of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called ''blockage''. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimes]], while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes [[pyrolysis]] and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. [[Pyrolysis]] can be measured in real time using [[thermogravimetric analysis]], so that the ablative performance can be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, John and C. Michael Hogan, &quot;Techniques for Wind Tunnel assessment of Ablative Materials&quot;, NASA Ames Research Center, Technical Publication, August, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]) and for reentry-vehicle nose tips.

Early research on ablation technology in the USA was centered at [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]] located at [[Moffett Field]], California. [[Ames Research Center]] was ideal, since it had numerous [[wind tunnels]] capable of generating varying wind velocities. Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a [[hypersonic]] wind tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael, Parker, John and Winkler, Ernest, of [[NASA]] Ames Research Center,  &quot;An Analytical Method for Obtaining the Thermogravimetric Kinetics of Char-forming Ablative Materials from Thermogravimetric Measurements&quot;, AIAA/ASME Seventh Structures and Materials Conference, April, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of ablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex. Many spacecraft thermal protection systems have been tested in this facility, including the Apollo, space shuttle, and Orion heat shield materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arc Jet Complex|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/arcjetcomplex.html|publisher=NASA|website = www.nasa.gov|access-date = 2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mars Pathfinder.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' during final assembly showing the aeroshell, cruise ring and solid rocket motor]]
The [[thermal conductivity]] of a particular TPS material is usually proportional to the material's density.&lt;ref name=&quot;Di Benedetto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Di Benedetto|first1=A.T.|last2=Nicolais|first2=L.|last3=Watanabe|first3=R.|title=Composite materials : proceedings of Symposium A4 on Composite Materials of the International Conference on Advanced Materials – ICAM 91, Strasbourg, France, 27–29 May 1991|date=1992|publisher=North-Holland|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0444893567|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also has high density which is undesirable. If the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material's conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material thus leading to TPS failure. Consequently, for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower-density TPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:

====Super light-weight ablator====
''SLA'' in ''SLA-561V'' stands for ''super light-weight ablator''. SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by [[Lockheed Martin]] that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70° sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (MSL). SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110&amp;nbsp;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300&amp;nbsp;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The MSL aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234&amp;nbsp;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The peak heat flux experienced by the ''[[Viking 1]]'' aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21&amp;nbsp;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For ''Viking 1'', the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation. ''Viking 1'' was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54&amp;nbsp;meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory). SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.&lt;ref&gt;

====Phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator====
[[Image:Stardust Capsule on Ground.jpg|thumb|left|upright|NASA's Stardust sample return capsule successfully landed at the USAF Utah Range.]]

It is a good choice for ablative applications such as high-peak-heating conditions found on sample-return missions or lunar-return missions. PICA's thermal conductivity is lower than other high-heat-flux-ablative materials, such as conventional carbon phenolics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

PICA was patented by [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in the 1990s and was the primary TPS material for the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] aeroshell.&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Huy K, et al., &quot;Qualification of the forebody heat shield of the Stardust's Sample Return Capsule&quot;, AIAA, Thermophysics Conference, 32nd, Atlanta, GA; 23–25 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stardust sample-return capsule was the fastest man-made object ever to reenter Earth's atmosphere ({{convert|12.4|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} at 135&amp;nbsp;km altitude).

Stardust's heat shield (0.81&amp;nbsp;m base diameter) was made of one monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak heating rate of 1.2&amp;nbsp;kW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A PICA heat shield was also used for the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] entry into the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;N+SX_picaX&quot;/&gt;

| quote=''SpaceX's material, called PICA-X, is 1/10th as expensive than the original [NASA PICA material and is better], ... a single PICA-X heat shield could withstand hundreds of returns from low Earth orbit; it can also handle the much higher energy reentries from the Moon or Mars.''

=====PICA-3=====
A second enhanced version of PICA—called PICA-3—was developed by SpaceX during the mid-2010s.  It was first flight tested on the [[Crew Dragon]] spacecraft in 2019 during the [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|flight demonstration mission]], in April 2019, and put into regular service on that spacecraft in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/#public NASA TV broadcast for the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission departure from the ISS], NASA, 1 August 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

NARTH claims to be a secular organization, differentiating it from other [[ex-gay]] groups that are primarily religious in nature. Nevertheless, NARTH often partners with religious groups,&lt;ref name = &quot;SCTECR&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author1 = Ariel Shidlo| author2 = Michael Schroeder | author3 = Jack Drescher| title = Sexual Conversion Therapy: Ethical, Clinical, and Research Perspectives| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1jYuientrGoC| year = 2001| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-7890-1911-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing]], [[Joel 2:25 International]], and [[Evergreen International]] in [[Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality]].

In July 2011, NARTH failed to pay its dues to the California Board for Behavioral Sciences and was removed from the list of groups that provide continuing education credits to therapists in California. NARTH had been an approved continuing education provider since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/inalameda/detail?entry_id=93944 NARTH No Longer Providing Continuing Education to California Therapists].

== Affiliations ==
NARTH had several connections to [[Evergreen International]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. The Evergreen website referenced the therapeutic methods of NARTH founder Joseph Nicolosi as &quot;beneficial&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Park |first1=Jason |title=Therapy |url=http://www.evergreeninternational.org/therapy.htm |publisher=Evergreen International |accessdate=29 November 2016 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415231648/http://www.evergreeninternational.org/therapy.htm |archive-date=15 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolosi worked with [[A.

In 2003, the leaders of [[Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality]] (PATH) made NARTH a member.

===Gerald Schoenewolf===
In April 2005, NARTH published on its website an essay titled &quot;Gay Rights and Political Correctness: A Brief History&quot;, written by [[Gerald Schoenewolf]], a member of NARTH's Science Advisory Committee.  The essay made several controversial claims, including that the civil rights and gay rights movements are &quot;destructive&quot;, that the American Psychological Association &quot;has been taken over by extremist gays&quot;, and that Africans were fortunate to have been sold into slavery.&lt;ref name = SPLConEssay /&gt; The SPLC called it an angry polemic that made outrageous historical claims and criticised both NARTH and Schoenewolf. The essay drew little attention until a letter of protest was presented to NARTH by the [[National Black Justice Coalition]] in mid-September 2006.  Truth Wins Out then called on [[Focus on the Family]] to cancel a planned appearance by Nicolosi at their conference.  Nicolosi appeared as planned but the Schoenewolf essay was removed from the NARTH website the same day.  On October 6, 2006, NARTH published a statement: &quot;NARTH regrets the comments made by Dr. Schoenewolf about slavery which have been misconstrued by some of our readers.&quot;&lt;ref name = SPLConEssay&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/anti-gay-organization-narth-publishes-essay-gay-rights-and-political-correctness|journal = Intelligence Report|date = January 16, 2007|issue = 124|title = Anti-Gay Organization NARTH Publishes Essay on Gay Rights and Political Correctness|first = Brentin|last = Mock|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150726000244/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/winter/one-more-enemy|archive-date = July 26, 2015|access-date = August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes &lt;ref name=&quot;PTS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last = Lewandowski | title = Growth in the Size of Unit Loads and Shipping Containers from Antique to WWI. | journal = Packaging Technology and Science | volume = 29 |  issue = 8–9 | year =  2016 | pages =  451–478 | issn = 1099-1522| doi = 10.1002/pts.2231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and special forklift trucks.  All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.

Containerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after [[World War II]], when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in [[globalization]].  Containerization did away with the manual sorting of most shipments and the need for warehousing. It displaced many thousands of dock workers who formerly handled [[break bulk cargo]]. Containerization also reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time and reduced losses from damage and theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|access-date=17 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archive-date=22 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Containers can be made from a wide range of materials such as steel, fibre-reinforced polymer, aluminium or a combination of all. 

Containers can be made of [[weathering steel]] to minimize [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] needs.

== Origin ==
[[File:Queens Wharf, Port Adelaide, before 1927.jpeg|thumb|Loading assorted break bulk cargo onto ships manually]]
[[File:LMS freight containers on lorry and rail wagon (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|Transferring freight containers on the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS; 1928).jpg]]

Before containerization, goods were usually handled manually as [[break bulk cargo]]. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle from the factory and taken to a port warehouse where they would be offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved to the side of the ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson&quot;/&gt;

Containerization has its origins in early [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal mining regions in England]] beginning in the late 18th century. In 1766 [[James Brindley]]  designed the box boat 'Starvationer' with 10 wooden containers, to transport coal from [[Worsley]] Delph (quarry) to Manchester by [[Bridgewater Canal]]. In 1795, [[Benjamin Outram]] opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in [[wagons]] built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal [[barge]]s on the [[Derby Canal]], which Outram had also promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, David (1993). ''The Little Eaton Gangway and Derby Canal'' (Second ed.). Oakwood Press. {{ISBN|0-85361-431-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1830s, railroads on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in the United Kingdom was one of these. &quot;Simple rectangular timber boxes, four to a wagon, they were used to convey coal from the Lancashire collieries to Liverpool, where they were transferred to horse-drawn carts by crane.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Essery, R. J, Rowland. D. P. &amp; Steel W. O. ''British Goods Wagons from 1887 to the Present Day''. Augustus M. Kelly Publishers. New York USA. 1979 Page 92&lt;/ref&gt; Originally used for moving coal on and off barges, &quot;loose boxes&quot; were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, at places like the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. By the 1840s, iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones. The early 1900s saw the adoption of closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail.

=== Twentieth century ===
On 17 May 1917, Benjamin Franklin Fitch inaugurated exploitation of an experimental installation for transfer of the containers called demountable bodies based on his own design in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] in US. Later in 1919, his system was extended to over 200 containers serving 21 railway stations with 14 freight trucks.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Prior to the Second World War, many European countries independently developed container systems.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

In 1919,  Stanisław Rodowicz, an [[engineer]], developed the first draft of the container system in [[Poland]]. In 1920, he built a prototype of the biaxial wagon. The [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] stopped development of the container system in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&amp;T&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last = Lewandowski | title = Stanisław Rodowicz, Eng.

The US Post Office contracted with the [[New York Central Railroad]] to move mail via containers in May 1921.  In 1930, the [[Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad]] began shipping containers between Chicago and Milwaukee.  However, their efforts ended in the spring of 1931 when the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] wouldn't allow the use of a flat rate for the containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=H. Roger |date=1996 |title=The Northwestern A History of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway System |location=DeKalb, IL |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University Press]] |page=156 |isbn=978-0-87580-214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, a regular connection of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, [[Golden Arrow (train)|Golden Arrow]]/[[La Flèche d’Or (train)|Fleche d'Or]],  by [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] and [[French Northern Railway]], began. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat cars in the UK and &quot;CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL&quot; in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator [[Silvio Benigno Crespi|Silvio Crespi]] proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition.  This would be done under the auspices of an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided international carriage of passengers in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular container service in the northeast United States. After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means of transport for cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in [[Venice]] on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests were done to assess the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;logistica2014a&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal | first = Krzysztof | last =  Lewandowski | title = Czechoslovak activity to prepare European norms for containers before the Second World War|journal=Acta Logistica|volume=1|year=2014|issue=4|pages=1–7|issn=1339-5629|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270794211| format = PDF | doi = 10.22306/al.v1i4.25 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, 1931, in USA Benjamin Franklin Fitch designed the two largest and heaviest containers in existence anywhere at the time. One measured {{cvt|17|ft|6|in|m|2}} by {{cvt|8|ft|0|in|m|2}} by {{cvt|8|ft|0|in|m|2}} with a capacity of {{convert|30,000|lb|kg}} in {{convert|890|cuft|m3}}, and a second measured {{cvt|20|ft|0|in|m|2}} by {{cvt|8|ft|0|in|m|2}} by {{cvt|8|ft|0|in|m|2}}, with a capacity of {{convert|50,000|lb|kg}}  in {{convert|1,000|cuft|m3}}.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

In November 1932 in [[Enola, Pennsylvania|Enola, PA]] the first [[container terminal]] in the world was opened by [[Pennsylvania Railroad|The Pennsylvania Railroad Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;logistica2014a&quot; /&gt; The Fitch hooking system was used for reloading of the containers.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

The development of containerization was created in Europe and the US as a way to revitalize rail companies after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which had caused economic collapse and reduction in use of all modes of transport &lt;ref name=&quot;logistica2014a&quot; /&gt;

In 1933 in Europe under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce the [[Bureau International des Containers|International Container Bureau]] (French: ''Bureau International des Conteneurs'', B.I.C.) was established.  In June 1933, the&amp;nbsp;B.I.C. decided on obligatory parameters for containers used in international traffic. Containers handled by means of lifting gear, such as cranes, overhead conveyors, etc. for traveling elevators (group I containers), constructed after July 1, 1933. Obligatory Regulations: 
* Clause 1.—Containers are, as regards form, either of the closed or the open type, and, as regards capacity, either of the heavy or the light type. 
* Clause 2.—The loading capacity of containers must be such that their total weight (load, plus tare) is: {{convert|5|t|2|lk=on}} for containers of the heavy type; {{convert|2.5|t|2}} for containers of the light type; a tolerance of 5 percent excess on the total weight is allowable under the same conditions as for wagon loads.&lt;ref name=&quot;logistica2014a&quot; /&gt;

From 1926 to 1947 in the United States, the [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway]] carried motor carrier vehicles and shippers' vehicles loaded on [[flatcar]]s between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois. Beginning in 1929, [[Seatrain Lines]] carried railroad boxcars on its sea vessels to transport goods between New York and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Seatrain: Railroad or steamship line? | first =  Robert E. | last = Mohowski | journal = Classic Trains |date=Spring 2011 | pp = 64–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s, the [[Chicago Great Western Railway]] and then the [[New Haven Railroad]] began &quot;[[Piggyback (transportation)#Rail|piggyback]]&quot; service (transporting highway freight trailers on flatcars) limited to their own railroads.  The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles.  Other components included wheel chocks and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Great Western Railway'', David J. Fiore, Sr., Charleston, South Carolina:  Arcadia Publishing, 2006, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1953, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]], the [[Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad|Chicago and Eastern Illinois]], and the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.

==== World War II ====
During World War II, the [[Australian Army]] used containers to help more easily deal with various [[break of gauge|breaks of gauge]] in the railroads. These non-stackable containers were about the size of the later [[Teus|20-foot ISO container]] and perhaps made mainly of wood.&lt;ref&gt;'''With Iron Rails''' p8.26 by David Burke 1988{{Full citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Gueterwagen anagoria.JPG|thumb|Freight car in railway museum [[Bochum Dahlhausen Railway Museum|Bochum-Dahlhausen]], showing four different UIC-590 pa-containers]]

During the same time, the [[United States Army]] started to combine items of uniform size, lashing them onto a pallet, [[Unit load|unitizing]] cargo to speed the loading and unloading of transport ships. In 1947 the [[Transportation Corps]] developed the ''Transporter'', a rigid, corrugated steel container with a {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} carrying capacity, for shipping household goods of officers in the field. It was {{cvt|8|ft|6|in|m|2}} long, {{cvt|6|ft|3|in|m|2}}, and {{cvt|6|ft|10|in|m|2}}&quot; high, with double doors on one end, mounted on skids, and had lifting rings on the top four corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Ham |first=Hans |last2=Rijsenbrij |first2=Joan |date=2012-12-15 |title=Development of Containerization |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CgQmkTczzPwC&amp;pg=PA8 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=[[IOS Press]] |page=8 |isbn=978-1614991465 |access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportation.army.mil/museum/transportation%20museum/CONEX.htm |title=History &amp; Development of the Container — The &quot;Transporter&quot;, predecessor to the CONEX |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 May 2013 |website=www.transportation.army.mil |publisher=[[U.S. Army Transportation Museum]] |access-date=20 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720104152/http://www.transportation.army.mil/museum/transportation%20museum/CONEX.htm |archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]] the Transporter was evaluated for handling sensitive military equipment and, proving effective, was approved for broader use.

==== Mid-twentieth century ====
In April 1951, at [[Zürich Tiefenbrunnen railway station]], the Swiss Museum of Transport and ''[[Bureau International des Containers]]'' (BIC) held demonstrations of container systems, with the aim of selecting the best solution for Western Europe. Present were representatives from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Great Britain, Italy and the United States. The system chosen for Western Europe was based on the Netherlands' system for consumer goods and waste transportation called ''Laadkisten'' (literally, &quot;loading bins&quot;), in use since 1934. This system used [[roller container]]s that were moved by rail, truck and ship, in various configurations up to a capacity of {{convert|5500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and up to {{convert|3.1 x 2.3 x 2|m|ftin|frac=8}} size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.K. |title=Vorläufer der heutigen Container: pa, BT und B900 | trans-title=Predecessors of today's containers: pa, BT and B900 |language=de |url=http://s1gf.de/index.php?page=Attachment&amp;attachmentID=15438&amp;h=baff58dff7aacd89e3c5f73a93e2a6f668971165 |journal=MIBA |issue=Special 54 |pages=12–19 |access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nicospilt.com/index_laadkisten.htm |title=Laadkistvervoer - Langs de rails |author=Nico Spilt |language=nl |trans-title=Loading bin transport |access-date=20 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720180139/http://www.nicospilt.com/index_laadkisten.htm |archive-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the first post World War&amp;nbsp;II European railway standard [[International Union of Railways|UIC]] 590, known as &quot;pa-Behälter.&quot; It was implemented in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;PojazdySzynowe2015a&quot;/&gt;

The first major shipment of CONEXes, containing engineering supplies and spare parts, was made by rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the [[Port of San Francisco]], then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea, in late 1952; shipment times were almost halved. By the time of the [[Vietnam War]] the majority of supplies and materials were shipped by CONEX. By 1965 the US military used some 100,000 Conex boxes, and more than 200,000 in 1967.&lt;ref name=VanHam/&gt;&lt;ref name=JLRBreport&gt;{{Cite report |date=15 December 1970 |title=Logistic Support in the Vietnam Era |volume=7: Containerization |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/877965.pdf |publisher=US DoD Joint Logistics Review Board |pages=9–11 |access-date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making this the first worldwide application of intermodal containers.&lt;ref name=Heinsthesis/&gt; After the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] standardized an {{convert|8 by 8|ft|m|2|adj=on}} cross section container in multiples of {{convert|10|ft|m|2|adj=on}} lengths for military use, it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1955, former trucking company owner [[Malcom McLean]] worked with engineer [[Keith Tantlinger]] to develop the modern [[intermodal container]]. The challenge was to design a [[shipping container]] that could efficiently be loaded onto ships and would hold securely on long sea voyages. The result was a {{convert|8|ft|m|2}} tall by {{convert|8|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide box in {{convert|10|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}-long units constructed from {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick corrugated steel. The design incorporated a [[twistlock]] mechanism atop each of the four corners, allowing the container to be [[spreader (container)|easily secured and lifted]] using cranes. After helping McLean create the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to industry; this began international standardization of shipping containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-boxtcb&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=The Box that Changed Britain|people=McGough, Roger (Narrator), McAulay, Graeme (Director &amp; Producer), Crossley-Holland, Dominic (Executive Producer)|medium=documentary|work=BBC4|publisher=BBC|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first vessels purpose-built to carry containers had begun operation in 1926 for the regular connection of the luxury passenger train between London and Paris, the Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or. Four containers were used for the conveyance of passengers' baggage. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to the ports of Dover or Calais.&lt;ref name=&quot;logistica2014a&quot; /&gt;

The next step was in Europe was after the Second World War.  Vessels purpose-built to carry containers were used between UK and Netherlands &lt;ref name=&quot;PojazdySzynowe2015a&quot; /&gt; and also in Denmark in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Marc Levinson | title = The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger | publisher = Princeton Univ.

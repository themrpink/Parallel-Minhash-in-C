; Advantages and disadvantages 
The advantages of this method are using 2-D image and 3-D data together, F l-score (which gives a measure of test's accuracy), average precision (AP) are higher than that when only 3-D data from lidar is used. These scores are conventional measurements which judge the framework. The drawback of this method is the usage of BING for object proposal estimation as BING predicts a small set of object bounding boxes.

===== Obstacle detection and road environment recognition using lidar =====
This method proposed by Kun Zhou et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Zhou|first1=Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Xiqin|last3=Tomizukat|first3=Masayoshi|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|last5=Chant|first5=Ching-Yao|title=A New Manoeuvring Target Tracking Algorithm with Input Estimation|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 American Control Conference |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-7803-7298-6|doi=10.1109/ACC.2002.1024798|s2cid=114167319|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1263011}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only focuses on object detection and tracking but also recognizes lane marking and road features. As mentioned earlier the lidar systems use rotating hexagonal mirrors that split the laser beam into six beams. The upper three layers are used to detect the forward objects such as vehicles and roadside objects. The sensor is made of weather-resistant material. The data detected by lidar are clustered to several segments and tracked by [[Kalman filter]]. Data clustering here is done based on characteristics of each segment based on object model, which distinguish different objects such as vehicles, signboards, etc. These characteristics include the dimensions of the object, etc. The reflectors on the rear edges of vehicles are used to differentiate vehicles from other objects. Object tracking is done using a 2-stage Kalman filter considering the stability of tracking and the accelerated motion of objects&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Lidar reflective intensity data is also used for curb detection by making use of robust regression to deal with occlusions. The road marking is detected using a modified Otsu method by distinguishing rough and shiny surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Y. Hata|first1=Alberto|last2=F. Wolf|first2=Denis|title=Feature Detection for Vehicle Localization in Urban Environments Using a Multilayer LIDAR|journal=IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System|volume=17|issn=1558-0016|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Advantages
Roadside reflectors that indicate lane border are sometimes hidden due to various reasons. Therefore, other information is needed to recognize the road border. The lidar used in this method can measure the reflectivity from the object. Hence, with this data road border can also be recognized. Also, the usage of sensor with weather-robust head helps detecting the objects even in bad weather conditions. Canopy Height Model before and after flood is a good example. Lidar can detect high detailed canopy height data as well as its road border.

Lidar measurements help identify the spatial structure of the obstacle. This helps distinguish objects based on size and estimate the impact of driving over it.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

Lidar systems provide better range and a large field of view which helps detecting obstacles on the curves. This is one major advantage over RADAR systems which have a narrower field of view. The fusion of lidar measurement with different sensors makes the system robust and useful in real-time applications, since lidar dependent systems can't estimate the dynamic information about the detected object.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

It has been shown that lidar can be manipulated, such that self-driving cars are tricked into taking evasive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/07/hackers-trick-self-driving-cars-lidar-sensor|title=Hackers can trick self-driving cars into taking evasive action|journal=The Guardian|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lidar has also found many applications in [[forestry]]. [[canopy (forest)|Canopy]] heights, [[biomass]] measurements, and leaf area can all be studied using airborne lidar systems. Similarly, lidar is also used by many industries, including Energy and Railroad, and the Department of Transportation as a faster way of surveying. Topographic maps can also be generated readily from lidar, including for recreational use such as in the production of [[orienteering]] maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidarbasemaps.org |title=Lidar Links of Use in Mapping |website=Lidarbasemaps.org |access-date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lidar has also been applied to estimate and assess the biodiversity of plants, fungi, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Clawges|first1=Rick|last2=Vierling|first2=Kerri|last3=Vierling|first3=Lee|last4=Rowell|first4=Eric|date=15 May 2008|title=The use of airborne lidar to assess avian species diversity, density, and occurrence in a pine/aspen forest|journal=Remote Sensing of Environment|volume=112|issue=5|pages=2064–2073|doi=10.1016/j.rse.2007.08.023|bibcode=2008RSEnv.112.2064C|issn=0034-4257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last1=Moeslund|first1=Jesper Erenskjold|last2=Zlinszky|first2=András|last3=Ejrnæs|first3=Rasmus|last4=Brunbjerg|first4=Ane Kirstine|last5=Bøcher|first5=Peder Klith|last6=Svenning|first6=Jens-Christian|last7=Normand|first7=Signe|date=2019-01-04|title=LIDAR explains diversity of plants, fungi, lichens and bryophytes across multiple habitats and large geographic extent|doi=10.1101/509794|s2cid=92548355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Simonson|first1=William D.|last2=Allen|first2=Harriet D.|last3=Coomes|first3=David A.|date=2014-07-05|title=Applications of airborne lidar for the assessment of animal species diversity|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|volume=5|issue=8|pages=719–729|doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12219|issn=2041-210X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Valdez|first1=Jose|last2=Brunbjerg|first2=Ane Kirstine|last3=Fløjgaard|first3=Camilla|last4=Dalby|first4=Lars|last5=Clausen|first5=Kevin K.|last6=Pärtel|first6=Meelis|last7=Pfeifer|first7=Norbert|last8=Hollaus|first8=Markus|last9=Wimmer|first9=Michael H.|last10=Ejrnæs|first10=Rasmus|last11=Moeslund|first11=Jesper Erenskjold|date=2020-07-03|title=Investigating the drivers of macro-fungal dark diversity using LiDAR|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.185553v1|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=2020.07.02.185553|doi=10.1101/2020.07.02.185553|s2cid=220366209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the [[Save the Redwoods League]] has undertaken a project to map the tall redwoods on the Northern California coast. Lidar allows research scientists to not only measure the height of previously unmapped trees, but to determine the biodiversity of the redwood forest. [[Stephen Sillett]], who is working with the League on the North Coast lidar project, claims this technology will be useful in directing future efforts to preserve and protect ancient redwood trees.&lt;ref&gt;Councillor Quarterly, Summer 2007 Volume 6 Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Geology and soil science===
High-resolution [[digital elevation map]]s generated by airborne and stationary lidar have led to significant advances in [[geomorphology]] (the branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of the Earth surface topography). The lidar abilities to detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks, to measure the land-surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy, to better resolve spatial derivatives of elevation, and to detect elevation changes between repeat surveys have enabled many novel studies of the physical and chemical processes that shape landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hughes, M.

In 2005 the [[Tour Ronde]] in the [[Mont Blanc massif]] became the first high [[Alps|alpine mountain]] on which lidar was employed to monitor the increasing occurrence of severe rock-fall over large rock faces allegedly caused by climate change and degradation of permafrost at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabatel|first1=Antoine|last2=Deline|first2=Philip|last3=Jaillet|first3=Ste'phane|last4=Ravanel|first4=Ludovic|title=Rock falls in high-alpine rock walls quantified by terrestrial lidar measurements: A case study in the Mont Blanc area|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=28 May 2008|volume=35|issue=10|pages=L10502|doi=10.1029/2008GL033424|bibcode = 2008GeoRL..3510502R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lidar is also used in structural geology and geophysics as a combination between airborne lidar and [[GNSS]] for the detection and study of  [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s, for measuring [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=Dickson|last2=Grebby|first2=Stephen|last3=Tansey|first3=Kevin|last4=Gosar|first4=Andrej|last5=Kastelic|first5=Vanja|date=2006|title=Application of airborne LiDAR to mapping seismogenic faults in forested mountainous terrain, southeastern Alps, Slovenia|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=33|issue=20|pages=L20308|doi=10.1029/2006GL027014|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2006GeoRL..3320308C|url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/33910/1/Cunningham_et_al_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The output of the two technologies can produce extremely accurate elevation models for terrain – models that can even measure ground elevation through trees.

Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used extensively to monitor [[glacier]]s and perform coastal change analysis.
The combination is also used by soil scientists while creating a [[soil survey]]. The detailed terrain modeling allows soil scientists to see slope changes and landform breaks which indicate patterns in soil spatial relationships.

===Atmosphere===
&lt;!--Differential absorption lider redirects here--&gt;
{{main|Atmospheric lidar}}
Initially, based on ruby lasers, lidar for meteorological applications was constructed shortly after the invention of the laser and represent one of the first applications of laser technology. Lidar technology has since expanded vastly in capability and lidar systems are used to perform a range of measurements that include profiling clouds, measuring winds, studying aerosols, and quantifying various atmospheric components. Atmospheric components can in turn provide useful information including surface pressure (by measuring the absorption of oxygen or nitrogen), greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), photosynthesis (carbon dioxide), fires (carbon monoxide), and humidity (water vapor). [[Atmospheric lidar]]s can be either ground-based, airborne or satellite depending on the type of measurement.

Atmospheric lidar remote sensing works in two ways – 
# by measuring backscatter from the atmosphere, and 
# by measuring the scattered reflection off the ground (when the lidar is airborne) or other hard surface.

Backscatter from the atmosphere directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. ''Doppler lidar'' and ''Rayleigh Doppler lidar'' are used to measure temperature and/or wind speed along the beam by measuring the frequency of the backscattered light. The [[Doppler broadening]] of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | year = 2011 | first1 = T. |title = Middle atmosphere temperature trend and solar cycle revealed by long-term Rayleigh lidar observations |journal = J.

Retrieved 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doppler lidar systems are also now beginning to be successfully applied in the renewable energy sector to acquire wind speed, turbulence, wind veer, and wind shear data. Both pulsed and continuous wave systems are being used. Pulsed systems use signal timing to obtain vertical distance resolution, whereas continuous wave systems rely on detector focusing.

The term, ''eolics'', has been proposed to describe the collaborative and interdisciplinary study of wind using computational fluid mechanics simulations and Doppler lidar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;Clive, P.

The ground reflection of an airborne lidar gives a measure of surface reflectivity (assuming the atmospheric transmittance is well known) at the lidar wavelength, however, the ground reflection is typically used for making absorption measurements of the atmosphere. &quot;Differential absorption lidar&quot; (DIAL) measurements utilize two or more closely spaced (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;nm) wavelengths to factor out surface reflectivity as well as other transmission losses, since these factors are relatively insensitive to wavelength. When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas, DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration (mixing ratio) of that particular gas in the atmosphere. This is referred to as an ''Integrated Path Differential Absorption'' (IPDA) approach, since it is a measure of the integrated absorption along the entire lidar path. IPDA lidars can be either pulsed&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = Grady J. | last2 = Barnes | first2 = Bruce W | last3 = Petros | first3 = Mulugeta | last4 = Beyon | first4 = Jeffrey Y | last5 = Amzajerdian | first5 = Farzin | last6 = Yu | first6 = Jirong | last7 = Davis | first7 = Richard E | last8 = Ismail | first8 = Syed | last9 = Vay | first9 = Stephanie | last10 = Kavaya | first10 = Michael J | last11 = Singh | first11 = Upendra N | year = 2004| title = Coherent Differential Absorption Lidar Measurements of CO2 | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 43 | issue = 26| pages = 5092–5099 | doi = 10.1364/AO.43.005092 | pmid = 15468711 |bibcode = 2004ApOpt..43.5092K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Abshire|first1=James B.|last2=Ramanathan|first2=Anand|last3=Riris|first3=Haris|last4=Mao|first4=Jianping|last5=Allan|first5=Graham R.|last6=Hasselbrack|first6=William E.|last7=Weaver|first7=Clark J.|last8=Browell|first8=Edward V.|date=2013-12-30|title=Airborne Measurements of CO2 Column Concentration and Range Using a Pulsed Direct-Detection IPDA Lidar|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=443–469|doi=10.3390/rs6010443|bibcode=2013RemS....6..443A|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CW&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Joel F. | year = 2013| title = Nonlinear swept frequency technique for CO2 measurements using a CW laser system | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 52 | issue = 13| pages = 3100–3107 | doi = 10.1364/AO.52.003100 | pmid = 23669780 |arxiv = 1303.4933 |bibcode = 2013ApOpt..52.3100C | s2cid = 45261286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically use two or more wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobler | first1 = Jeremy T. | last2 = Harrison | first2 = F.

==== Scheimpflug principle ====
Another lidar technique for atmospheric remote sensing has emerged. It is based on [[Scheimpflug principle]], referred to as '''Scheimpflug lidar''' ('''slidar''').&lt;ref&gt;Liang Mei, Mikkel Brydegaard, Continuous-wave differential absorption lidar, Laser and Photonics Reviews 9, 629-636 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;''The implication of the Scheimpflug principle is that when a laser beam is transmitted into the atmosphere, the backscattering echo of the entire illuminating probe volume is still in focus simultaneously without diminishing the aperture as long as the object plane, image plane and the lens plane intersect with each other''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; A two dimensional CCD/CMOS camera is used to resolve the backscattering echo of the transmitted laser beam.

Thus as in the case of conventional lidar technologies continuous wave light sources such as diode lasers can be employed for remote sensing instead of using complicated nanosecond pulse light sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mei|first=Liang|title=Remote sensing of atmospheric aerosol and gas using scheimpflug lidar based on diode lasers|journal=Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS) |isbn=978-1-5090-6094-8|date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLidar system is also a robust and inexpensive system based on compact laser diodes and array detectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liang Mei and Mikkel Brydegaard, &quot;Atmospheric aerosol monitoring by an elastic Scheimpflug lidar system,&quot; Opt.

Express 25, A628-A638 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
A continuous-wave (CW) NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; DIAL system based on the Scheimpflug principle has been developed by employing a compact high-power CW multimode 450&amp;nbsp;nm laser diode as the light source. Laser emissions at the on-line and off-line wavelengths of the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption spectrum are implemented by tuning the injection current of the laser diode. Lidar signals are detected by a 45° tilted area CCD image sensor satisfying the Scheimpflug principle. Range-resolved NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations on a near-horizontal path are obtained by the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; DIAL system in the range of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;km and show good agreement with those measured by a conventional air pollution monitoring station. A detection sensitivity of ± 0.9 ppbv at 95% confidence level in the region of 0.3–1&amp;nbsp;km is achieved with 15-minute averaging and 700 m range resolution during hours of darkness, which allows accurate concentration measurement of ambient NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The low-cost and robust DIAL system demonstrated in this work opens up many possibilities for field NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remote sensing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-20-A953 |author1= Liang Mei |author2= Peng Guan |author3= Zheng Kong |title= Remote sensing of atmospheric NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by employing the continuous-wave differential absorption lidar technique |volume= 25 |issue= 20 |pages= A953–A962 |journal= [[Optics Express]] |year= 2017 |doi= 10.1364/OE.25.00A953 |pmid= 29041305 |bibcode= 2017OExpr..25A.953M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
Few military applications are known to be in place and are classified (such as the lidar-based speed measurement of the [[AGM-129 ACM]] stealth nuclear cruise missile), but a considerable amount of research is underway in their use for imaging. Higher resolution systems collect enough detail to identify targets, such as [[tank]]s. Examples of military applications of lidar include the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for counter-mine warfare by Areté Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arete.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904075643/http://www.arete.com/index.php?view=stil_mcm|url-status=dead|title=Areté|archive-date=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NATO report (RTO-TR-SET-098) evaluated the potential technologies to do stand-off detection for the discrimination of biological warfare agents. The potential technologies evaluated were Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Differential Scattering (DISC), and Ultraviolet Laser Induced Fluorescence (UV-LIF). The report concluded that : ''Based upon the results of the lidar systems tested and discussed above, the Task Group recommends that the best option for the near-term (2008–2010) application of stand-off detection systems is UV-LIF '',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nato.int/pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=RTO-TR-SET-098 |title=NATO Laser Based Stand-Off Detection of biological Agents |publisher=Rta.nato.int |access-date=2013-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720141859/http://www.rta.nato.int/pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=RTO-TR-SET-098 |archive-date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the long-term, other techniques such as stand-off [[Raman spectroscopy]] may prove to be useful for identification of biological warfare agents.

Short-range compact spectrometric lidar based on Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) would address the presence of bio-threats in aerosol form over critical indoor, semi-enclosed and outdoor venues such as stadiums, subways, and airports. This near real-time capability would enable rapid detection of a bioaerosol release and allow for timely implementation of measures to protect occupants and minimize the extent of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ino.ca/en-CA/Achievements/Description/project-p/short-range-bioaerosol-threat-detection.html |title=Short-Range Bioaerosol Threat Detection Sensor (SR-BioSpectra) |publisher=Ino.ca |access-date=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Long-Range Biological Standoff Detection System (LR-BSDS) was developed for the U.S. Army to provide the earliest possible standoff warning of a biological attack. It is an airborne system carried by helicopter to detect synthetic aerosol clouds containing biological and chemical agents at long range. The LR-BSDS, with a detection range of 30&amp;nbsp;km or more, was fielded in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Nuclear,-Biological-and-Chemical-Defence/LR-BSDS--Long-Range-Biological-Standoff-Detection-System-United-States.html |title=Defense &amp; Security Intelligence &amp; Analysis: IHS Jane's &amp;#124; IHS |website=Articles.janes.com |access-date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Five lidar units produced by the German company [[Sick AG]] were used for short range detection on [[Stanley (vehicle)|Stanley]], the [[driverless car|autonomous car]] that won the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]].

Lidar sensors may also be used for obstacle detection and avoidance for robotic mining vehicles such as in the Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System (AHS)&lt;ref&gt;[[Modular Mining Systems#Autonomous Haulage Systems]]&lt;/ref&gt; used in Rio Tinto's Mine of the Future.

===Physics and astronomy===
A worldwide network of observatories uses [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment|lidars to measure the distance to reflectors placed on the moon]], allowing the position of the moon to be measured with millimeter precision and [[tests of general relativity]] to be done. [[Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter|MOLA]], the [[Mars]] Orbiting Laser Altimeter, used a lidar instrument in a Mars-orbiting satellite (the NASA [[Mars Global Surveyor]]) to produce a spectacularly precise global topographic survey of the red planet. Laser altimeters produced global elevation models of Mars, the Moon (Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA))  Mercury (Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA)), NEAR–Shoemaker Laser Rangefinder (NLR).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargitai 2019 147–174&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last1=Hargitai|first1=Henrik|title=Methods in Planetary Topographic Mapping: A Review|date=2019|work=Planetary Cartography and GIS|pages=147–174|editor-last=Hargitai|editor-first=Henrik|series=Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-62849-3_6|isbn=978-3-319-62849-3|last2=Willner|first2=Konrad|last3=Buchroithner|first3=Manfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future missions will also include laser altimeter experiments such as the Ganymede Laser Altimeter (GALA) as part of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargitai 2019 147–174&quot;/&gt;

In atmospheric physics, lidar is used as a remote detection instrument to measure densities of certain constituents of the middle and upper atmosphere, such as [[potassium]], [[sodium]], or molecular [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. These measurements can be used to calculate temperatures. Lidar can also be used to measure wind speed and to provide information about vertical distribution of the [[aerosol]] particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)|url=http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/about/payload.php#CALIOP|publisher=NASA|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock mechanics===
Lidar has been widely used in rock mechanics for rock mass characterization and slope change detection. Some important geomechanical properties from the rock mass can be extracted from the 3-D point clouds obtained by means of the lidar. Some of these properties are:

Some of these properties have been used to assess the geomechanical quality of the rock mass through the [[Rock mass rating|RMR]] index.

THOR is a laser designed toward measuring Earth's atmospheric conditions. The laser enters a cloud cover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/category/type/Lidar|title=Lidar {{!}} NASA Airborne Science Program|website=airbornescience.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measures the thickness of the return halo. The sensor has a fiber optic aperture with a width of 7.5 inches that is used to measure the return light.

===Robotics===
Lidar technology is being used in [[robotics]] for the perception of the environment as well as object classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftas.de/Main/Solutions |title=IfTAS |publisher=Iftas.de |access-date=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of lidar technology to provide three-dimensional elevation maps of the terrain, high precision distance to the ground, and approach velocity can enable safe landing of robotic and manned vehicles with a high degree of precision.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Lidar are also widely used in robotics for [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] and well integrated into robot simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/lidar-sensors |title=Lidar simulation models in Webots|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refer to the Military section above for further examples.

===Spaceflight===
Lidar is increasingly being utilized for [[Situation awareness|rangefinding]] and [[orbital element]] calculation of [[relative velocity]] in [[proximity operations]] and [[orbital stationkeeping|stationkeeping]] of [[spacecraft]]. Lidar has also been used for [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] studies from space. Short pulses of laser light beamed from a spacecraft can reflect off tiny particles in the atmosphere and back to a telescope aligned with the spacecraft laser. By precisely timing the lidar 'echo,' and by measuring how much laser light is received by the telescope, scientists can accurately determine the location, distribution and nature of the particles. The result is a revolutionary new tool for studying constituents in the atmosphere, from cloud droplets to industrial pollutants, which are difficult to detect by other means.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/LITE.html |title=NASA – Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |access-date=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D.M.

Airborne lidar sensors are used by companies in the remote sensing field. They can be used to create a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) or DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]); this is quite a common practice for larger areas as a plane can acquire 3–4&amp;nbsp;km wide swaths in a single flyover. Greater vertical accuracy of below 50&amp;nbsp;mm can be achieved with a lower flyover, even in forests, where it is able to give the height of the canopy as well as the ground elevation. Typically, a GNSS receiver configured over a georeferenced control point is needed to link the data in with the [[World Geodetic System|WGS]] ([[World Geodetic System]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Maritime Laser Scanning as the Source for Spatial Data|journal = Polish Maritime Research|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 9–14|doi = 10.1515/pomr-2015-0064|first1 = Jakub|last1 = Szulwic|first2 = Paweł|last2 = Burdziakowski|first3 = Artur|last3 = Janowski|first4 = Marek|last4 = Przyborski|first5 = Paweł|last5 = Tysiąc|first6 = Aleksander|last6 = Wojtowicz|first7 = Arthem|last7 = Kholodkov|first8 = Krzysztof|last8 = Matysik|first9 = Maciej|last9 = Matysik|year = 2015|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LiDAR are also in use in [[hydrographic survey]]ing. Depending upon the clarity of the water LiDAR can measure depths from 0.9m to 40m with a vertical accuracy of 15&amp;nbsp;cm and horizontal accuracy of 2.5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.iitk.ac.in/~blohani/LiDAR_Tutorial/Bathymetric%20LiDAR.htm|title=Bathymetric LiDAR|website=home.iitk.ac.in|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other statistical analysis use lidar data to estimate total plot information such as canopy volume, mean, minimum and maximum heights, and vegetation cover estimates. Aerial LiDAR has been used to map the bush fires in Australia in early 2020. The data was manipulated to view bare earth, and identify healthy and burned vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.airborneresearch.org.au/fires-2020&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of Lidar in wind related industry is to use [[computational fluid dynamics]] over Lidar-scanned surfaces in order to assess the wind potential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukač|first=Niko|author2=Štumberger Gorazd |author3=Žalik Borut |title=Wind resource assessment using airborne LiDAR data and smoothed particle hydrodynamics|journal=Environmental Modelling &amp; Software|year=2017|volume=95|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for optimal wind farms placement.

=== Solar photovoltaic deployment optimization ===
Lidar can also be used to assist planners and developers in optimizing solar [[photovoltaic]] systems at the city level by determining appropriate roof tops &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jochem|first=Andreas|author2=Höfle Bernhard |author3=Rutzinger Martin |author4=Pfeifer Norbert |title=Automatic roof plane detection and analysis in airborne lidar point clouds for solar potential assessment|journal=Sensors|year=2009|volume=9|issue=7|pages=5241–5262|doi=10.3390/s90705241|pmid=22346695|pmc=3274168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nguyen | first1 = Ha T. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | last3 = Harrap | first3 = Rob | last4 = Barber | first4 = Gerald | year = 2012 | title = The Application of LiDAR to Assessment of Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Deployment Potential on a Municipal District Unit | journal = Sensors | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 4534–4558 | doi=10.3390/s120404534| pmid = 22666044 | pmc = 3355426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for determining [[shading]] losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Ha T.|author2=Pearce, Joshua M. |title=Incorporating shading losses in solar photovoltaic potential assessment at the municipal scale|journal=Solar Energy|year=2012|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1245–1260|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.01.017|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00685775|bibcode = 2012SoEn...86.1245N |s2cid=15435496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent airborne laser scanning efforts have focused on ways to estimate the amount of solar light hitting vertical building facades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jochem|first=Andreas|author2=Höfle Bernhard |author3=Rutzinger Martin |title=Extraction of vertical walls from mobile laser scanning data for solar potential assessment|journal=Remote Sensing|year=2011|volume=3|issue=4|pages=650–667|doi=10.3390/rs3030650|bibcode = 2011RemS....3..650J |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by incorporating more detailed shading losses by considering the influence from vegetation and larger surrounding terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukač|first=Niko|author2=Žlaus Danijel |author3=Seme Seme |author4=Žalik Borut |author5=Štumberger Gorazd |title=Rating of roofs' surfaces regarding their solar potential and suitability for PV systems, based on LiDAR data|journal=Applied Energy|year=2013|volume=102|pages=803–812|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.08.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Recent simulation racing games such as [[rFactor Pro]], [[iRacing]], [[Assetto Corsa]] and [[Project CARS]] increasingly feature race tracks reproduced from 3-D point clouds acquired through Lidar surveys, resulting in surfaces replicated with centimeter or millimeter precision in the in-game 3-D environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-07-15|title=rFactor Pro - Laser Scanning Heaven|url=https://www.virtualr.net/rfactor-pro-laser-scanning-heaven|access-date=2020-06-04|website=VirtualR.net - 100% Independent Sim Racing News|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Marsh|first=William|date=2017-06-30|title=rFactor Pro Shows off LIDAR Scanned Hungaroring|url=https://simracingpaddock.com/rfactor2/rfactor-pro-shows-off-lidar-scanned-hungaroring/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=Sim Racing Paddock|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-02-08|title=New Tracks in Project CARS 2 Were Laser-Scanned With Drones|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/new-tracks-in-project-cars-2-were-laser-scanned-with-drones/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=GTPlanet|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 exploration game [[Scanner Sombre]], by [[Introversion Software]], uses Lidar as a fundamental game mechanic.

===Other uses===
The video for the song &quot;[[House of Cards (Radiohead song)|House of Cards]]&quot; by [[Radiohead]] was believed to be the first use of real-time 3-D laser scanning to record a music video. The range data in the video is not completely from a lidar, as structured light scanning is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&amp;newsId=129514&amp;sectionId=behind_the_work|author=Nick Parish|title=From OK Computer to Roll computer: Radiohead and director James Frost make a video without cameras|publisher=Creativity|date=2008-07-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717184531/http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&amp;newsId=129514&amp;sectionId=behind_the_work|archive-date=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative technologies==
{{further|3-D scanner}}
Recent development of [[Structure from motion|Structure From Motion]] (SFM) technologies allows delivering 3-D images and maps based on data extracted from visual and IR photography. The elevation or 3-D data is extracted using multiple parallel passes over mapped area, yielding both visual light images and 3-D structure from the same sensor, which is often a specially chosen and calibrated [[digital camera]]. {{citation_needed|date=June 2018}}

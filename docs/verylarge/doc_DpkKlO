The '''1948 Winter Olympics''', officially known as the '''V Olympic Winter Games''' ({{lang-fr|Les Ves Jeux olympiques d'hiver}}; {{lang-de|Olympische Winterspiele 1948}}; {{lang-it|V Giochi olimpici invernali}}; {{lang-rm|Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948}}), were a winter [[multi-sport event]] held from 30 January to 8 February 1948 in [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]]. The Games were the first to be celebrated after [[World War II]]; it had been twelve years since the last Winter Games in [[1936 Winter Olympics|1936]].

From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the 1948 Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of [[Sigfrid Edström]].

There were 28 nations that marched in the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening ceremonies]] on 30 January 1948. [[Bibi Torriani]] played for the [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team]], and became the first ice hockey player to recite the [[Olympic Oath]] on behalf of all athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOC&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Factsheet - Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Olympic_Winter_Games.pdf|url-status=dead|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821222755/https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/Opening_ceremony_of_the_Olympic_Winter_Games.pdf|archive-date=21 August 2016|access-date=22 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 670 athletes competed in 22 events in four sports. The 1948 Games also featured two demonstration sports: [[Military patrol at the 1948 Winter Olympics|military patrol]], which later became the [[biathlon]], and [[Winter pentathlon at the 1948 Winter Olympics|winter pentathlon]], which was discontinued after these Games.  Notable performances were turned in by figure skaters [[Dick Button]] and [[Barbara Ann Scott]] and skier [[Henri Oreiller]]. Most of the athletic venues were already in existence from the first time St. Moritz hosted the Winter Games in [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]]. All of the venues were outdoors, which meant the Games were heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions.

== Host city selection ==
The IOC selected St. Moritz to host the 1948 Games at the 39th [[IOC Session|general session]] in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, in September 1946.&lt;ref name=votes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124022022/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/past.html |archivedate=24 January 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection process consisted of two bids, and saw St. Moritz be selected ahead of [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], United States. St. Moritz was selected because it was located in Switzerland, which had remained neutral during the war, and also because it had already hosted a Winter Games in [[1928 Winter Olympic Games|1928]].  This made the organization of the Games simpler and more economical.  Despite the existence of many of the venues, it was still a difficult task to organize a Winter Olympic Games in less than 18 months.&lt;ref name=report7&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing==

The Comite Olympique (CO) was composed of local dignitaries and members of the Swiss National Olympic Committee (COS).&lt;ref name=report17&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  They decided to separate into several sub-committees responsible for various aspects of the Games.  These committees included housing and maintenance, venue construction, finances, and media and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  The local committees worked very closely with the Swiss federal government and the IOC to ensure that the organization of the Games proceeded without hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Since no athletes' village existed from the previous Games, the athletes and officials were housed in hotels around the city.&lt;ref name=report17/&gt;  It was very important for the committees to draw upon their experiences from the 1928 Olympics.  Their selection of locations for the various events was contingent on the weather conditions as all the events were held outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 800 people were involved in reporting the news of the Games to the world.&lt;ref name=report17/&gt;  Nearly 500 press credentials were issued by the Press Commission for the Games.  Television would not make its Olympic debut until 1956.  The coverage of the 1948 Games was split between newspapers and radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The organizing committee had to provide technology, such as long distance telephone lines and telegraph services, to assist the press in communicating with their constituents.&lt;ref name=report25&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 2,200 people were needed to provide all the services for the press, officials and athletes at the Games.  These services included sanitation, security, and care of the venues.&lt;ref name=report25/&gt;  Accommodating the influx of people into St. Moritz was a difficult task for the organizing committee.  It was complicated by the mountainous region in which the community was situated.  A massive project to improve the village's transportation infrastructure had to be completed prior to the Games.  This included building and widening roads for vehicular traffic.  Several train stations were built to accommodate the increased demands for public transit.  They also had to increase the capacity of the city's sewers.  All of the projects had to be approved by the Swiss government, and justified by its impact on the success of the Games.&lt;ref name=report25/&gt;  To aid the organizing committee the IOC demanded that all participating nations provide lists of their athletes several months prior to the Games.  Consequently, the Swiss knew exactly how many athletes and officials to plan for.&lt;ref name=report25/&gt;

==Politics==
Since these Games were the first since World War II they were given the name &quot;The Games of Renewal.&quot;&lt;ref name=dyk&gt;{{cite web|title=Did you know?|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/winterolympics/stmoritz1948/n214082230.shtml|accessdate=2009-05-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429051752/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/winterolympics/stmoritz1948/n214082230.shtml|archivedate=29 April 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan and Germany were not invited to these Games because they were still ostracized by the international community for their role in World War II.&lt;ref name=judd26&gt;Judd (2009), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Their absence was short-lived though, as they returned to Olympic competition in [[1952 Winter Olympics|1952]].&lt;ref name=fp315/&gt;  The Soviet Union did not send athletes to the St. Moritz Games of 1948, but they did send ten delegates as observers of the Games to determine how successful the Soviet athletes would have been had they competed.&lt;ref name=fp315/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comité Olympique Suisse (1948) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of World War II===
[[Sapporo]], Japan had been the choice for the [[1940 Winter Olympics|1940 Winter Games]].&lt;ref name=gutt74&gt;Guttman (2002) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1938, the Japanese decided to decline the invitation to host the Games claiming that preparations for the Olympic Games were draining the country's resources.&lt;ref name=gutt74/&gt;  The IOC turned to the host of the [[1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Games]], [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], which would make it the only city to host consecutive Games.&lt;ref name=gutt74/&gt;  This became impractical when Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on September 1, 1939; subsequently Germany withdrew its bid to host the Games.  Finland believed it could host the Games and extended an invitation to the IOC, but the Soviet Union's [[Winter War|invasion]] of Finland ended all hope of an Olympic Games in 1940.&lt;ref name=gutt74/&gt;  The [[1944 Winter Olympics]] had been awarded to [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], Italy in 1939.  As the war continued, this proved to be impractical and the second consecutive [[olympiad]] passed without a celebration of the Games.  The IOC was presented with two possible host cities for the first post-war Games: [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], United States and [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland.  The IOC decided to award the Games to Switzerland, a neutral country, immediately following World War II, in order to avoid political posturing on the part of former combatants.&lt;ref name=fp315&gt;Findling and Pelle (2004) p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of World War II was still being felt in 1948. The lack of financial resources and human energy made the organization of the Games challenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;findling316&quot;&gt;Findling and Pelle (2004), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes were also affected by a lack of resources.  Many competitors arrived with little or no equipment.  In one notable case, [[Norway at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Norwegian]] skiers had to borrow skis from the [[United States at the 1948 Winter Olympics|American]] team in order to compete.&lt;ref name=&quot;findling316&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=St. Moritz Olympics 1948 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url-access=registration  |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/214322/St-Moritz-Switzerland-1948#ref=ref665138 |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401072853/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games/214322/St-Moritz-Switzerland-1948 |archivedate=2009-04-01 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Medals were awarded in 22 events contested in 4 sports (9 disciplines).&lt;ref name=stmoritz&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Moritz 1948 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1948 |accessdate=2009-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423010846/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1948 |archivedate=2009-04-23 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bobsled===
{{Main|Bobsleigh at the 1948 Winter Olympics}}
Two sliding sports were contested at the 1948 Winter Games, the first was bobsled.  A controversy erupted when it was alleged that the sleds of the United States team had been sabotaged.  It was discovered that the steering wheels had been damaged.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|title=Storms over St. Moritz|work=Time Magazine|publisher=Time Inc.|date=1948-02-09|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856028,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After news broke of the apparent improprieties a truck driver stepped forward and admitted to having accidentally backed into the shed housing the bobsleds.&lt;ref name=findling318&gt;Findling &amp; Pelle (2004), p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;  The accident however did not hinder the United States teams who won a bronze in the two-man event and a gold and a bronze in the four-man event.&lt;ref name=results/&gt;  The [[Switzerland at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Swiss]] two-man teams placed first and second, which is the best possible results for the event since only two teams were allowed to enter.&lt;ref name=results/&gt;  The driver of the first place team, [[Felix Endrich]], beat his coach, the driver of the second place team, [[Fritz Feierabend]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

===Ice Hockey===
{{Main|Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics}}
The [[ice hockey]] tournament was won by [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], with [[Czechoslovakia at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Czechoslovakia]] second and [[Switzerland at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Switzerland]] third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Hockey at the 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games: Men's Ice Hockey |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/ICH/mens-ice-hockey.html |accessdate=2009-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903111140/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/ICH/mens-ice-hockey.html |archivedate=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the fifth Olympic gold medal for Canada in hockey.  The only team to beat Canada since hockey was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] was [[Great Britain at the 1936 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Buchanon and Mallon (2006), pp.45–46&lt;/ref&gt;  The tournament was almost cancelled when rival teams representing the [[United States]] arrived. An [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) team was supported by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC), and an [[Amateur Hockey Association]] (AHA) team was supported by the [[Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace]] (LIHG).&lt;ref name=&quot;findling316&quot;/&gt;  The [[International Olympic Committee]] ruled that neither team could compete, but the Swiss organizing committee allowed the AAU team to march in the [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening ceremony]], and the AHA team to play unofficially, without being eligible for medals.&lt;ref name=findling317&gt;Findling &amp; Pelle (2004), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figure skating===

{{Main|Figure skating at the 1948 Winter Olympics}}
[[Barbara Ann Scott]] became the first and only [[Canada at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Canadian]] woman to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating, when she won the competition at St. Moritz.  Despite the distraction caused by a low-flying airplane during her compulsory routine, she was able to muster the focus to place first entering the free skate.  The ice had been shredded the night before the free skate by two ice hockey games (the [[ice resurfacer]] had not yet been invented); nonetheless she was able to adjust her routine to avoid the potholes and emerge victorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where are they now:Barbara Ann Scott |last=Smith |first=Beverley |work=The Globe and Mail |publisher=CTVOlympics.ca |date=2009-05-03 |url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/figure-skating/news/newsid=10248.html |accessdate=2009-05-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526073710/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/figure-skating/news/newsid=10248.html |archivedate=2009-05-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen-year-old American [[Dick Button]] completed the unprecedented North American sweep of the figure skating gold medals.  He led the field after the compulsory skate and then won the gold medal by becoming the first person to ever complete a [[double Axel]] in competition. Later in the 1952 Olympics, Dick Button would win gold a second time.&lt;ref name=judd27&gt;Judd (2009), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  His victory came at the expense of [[Switzerland at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Swiss]] world champion [[Hans Gerschwiler]] who fell during the free skate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Fraser, Dick Button pace Yanks|last=Smits|first=Ted|work=The Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=1948-02-06|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/memories/48-button.htm|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the mishap Gershwiler would win the silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Han Gerschwiler|publisher=ABC.net|url=http://www.abc.net.au/olympics/2008/results/historical/athletes/6521.htm|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed skating===
{{main|Speed skating at the 1948 Winter Olympics}}
The speed skating competition was held on the same rink that had hosted the events in 1928.  At {{convert|1856|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the speed skating competition was held at the second highest altitude in Olympic history, only Squaw Valley in 1960 was higher.&lt;ref name=srss&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed skating at the 1948 Winter Olympics|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/SSK/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417054017/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/SSK/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-04-17|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition was dominated by the Scandinavian countries of Norway and Sweden who won nine out of the twelve possible medals.  Scandinavians had done poor in speed skating events up until the 1948 Games.  The reason for their success was that speed skating in Europe had come to a stand still during World War II.  Only countries that were ancillary to the conflict had the resources to keep their speed skating programs intact.&lt;ref name=srss/&gt;  The 500&amp;nbsp;meter race was won by [[Finn Helgesen]] of Norway.  There was a three-way tie for second place between Norwegian [[Thomas Byberg]] and Americans [[Robert Fitzgerald (speed skater)|Robert Fitzgerald]] and [[Kenneth Bartholomew]].  All three had finished in exactly 43.2&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=results/&gt; [[Sweden at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Swede]] [[Åke Seyffarth]] won a gold medal in the 10,000&amp;nbsp;meter race and a silver medal in the 1,500&amp;nbsp;meter race.&lt;ref name=results/&gt;  The 5,000&amp;nbsp;meter event was affected by weather.  The twenty racers encountered both wind, sun, and snow in the course of the day's competition.  Finally long-distance specialist [[Reidar Liaklev]] from Norway prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed Skating at the 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games-Men's 5,000 metres|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/SSK/mens-5000-metres.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418034142/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/SSK/mens-5000-metres.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-04-18|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the second largest of the [[Ionian Islands]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;/&gt; and, including its small satellite islands, forms the margin of the northwestern frontier of [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Where to Go in Greece: A New Look&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Trevor Webster|title=Where to Go in Greece: A New Look |year=1994 |publisher=Settle Press |isbn=9781872876207 |page=221 |volume=1|quote=Corfu is one of the most northern isles in Greece and also the most westerly, apart from three of its own small satellite isles... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_1vmm656RMC&amp;q=corfu+most+western+island+of+Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is part of the [[Corfu (regional unit)|Corfu regional unit]], and is administered by three municipalities with the islands of [[Othonoi]], [[Ereikoussa]] and [[Mathraki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;corfutvnews.gr&quot;&gt;https://corfutvnews.gr/diaspasi-deite-tin-tropologia/ {{in lang|el}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal city of the island (pop. 32,095) is also named [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{in lang|el}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corfu is home to the [[Ionian University]].

The island is bound up with the [[history of Greece]] from the beginnings of [[Greek mythology]]. Its history is full of battles and conquests. Ancient [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]] took part in the [[Battle of Sybota]] which was a catalyst for the [[Peloponnesian War]], and, according to Thucydides, the largest naval battle between Greek city states until that time. [[Thucydides]]  also reports that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers of fifth century BC Greece, along with [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Corinth]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 1.36.3&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of ancient Greek temples and other archaeological sites of the ancient city of Korkyra are found in Palaiopolis. Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the island are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way. As a result, Corfu's capital has been officially declared a ''Kastropolis'' (&quot;castle city&quot;) by the Greek government.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106230616/http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archivedate=6 January 2008|title=Corfu City Hall website|work=City of Corfu|quote=In literature, apart from the Homeric name Scheria, we meet various other names for the island, like Drepanë or Arpi, Makris, Cassopaea, Argos, Keravnia, Phaeacia, Corkyra or Kerkyra (in Doric), Gorgo or Gorgyra and much later the medieval names Corypho or Corfoi, because of the two characteristic rock-peaks of the Old Fortress of Corfu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From medieval times and into the 17th century, the island, having successfully repulsed the Ottomans during several sieges, was recognised as a bulwark of the European States against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and became one of the most fortified places in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keyssler1760&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Georg Keyssler|authorlink=Johann Georg Keyssler|title=Travels Through Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, and Lorrain: Giving a True and Just Description of the Present State of Those Countries …|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_oKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1760|publisher=G. Keith|page=54|quote=Corfu is not only a bulwark to the Venetians against the attack of a foreign enemy,... [...] ....and, since count Schulenburg caused several fortifications to be added to it, it may justly be looked upon as one of the strongest places in Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortifications of the island were used by the Venetians to defend against Ottoman intrusion into the [[Adriatic]]. Corfu eventually fell under British rule following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and was eventually ceded to Greece by the British Empire along with the remaining islands of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]. Unification with [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|modern Greece]] was concluded in 1864 under the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]]. Corfu is the origin of the [[Ionian Academy]], the first university of the modern Greek state, and the ''[[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]]'', the first Greek theatre and [[opera house]] of modern Greece. The first governor of independent Greece after the revolution of 1821, founder of the modern Greek state, and distinguished European diplomat [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] was born in Corfu.

In 2007, the city's old town was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], following a recommendation by [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6248244.stm |title=on UNESCO World Heritage List |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICOMOS&quot;&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/978.pdf UNESCO Advisory Body ([[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]) report on Corfu History retrieved 3 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/978/ |title=Old Town of Corfu on UNESCO website retrieved 3 July 2007 |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of European Council meetings|1994 European Union summit]] was held in Corfu.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=European Union Summit: Corfu summiteers ready to fudge key EU decision|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/european-union-summit-corfu-summiteers-ready-to-fudge-key-eu-decision-national-status-on-parade-as-leaders-of-the-twelve-consider-two-candidates-to-succeed-jacques-delors-as-commission-president-1424715.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 June 1994|author=ANDREW MARSHALL IN CORFU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Garwood, Mediterranean Europe, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell King, John Connell, Small worlds, global lives: islands and migration, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Greek name, ''Kerkyra'' or ''[[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]]'', is related to two powerful water deities: [[Poseidon]], god of the sea, and [[Asopus|Asopos]], an important Greek mainland river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek Mythology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKorkyra.html |title=Greek Mythology Encyclopedia |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to myth, Poseidon fell in love with the beautiful nymph Korkyra, daughter of Asopos and river nymph [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]], and abducted her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek Mythology&quot;/&gt; Poseidon brought Korkyra to the hitherto unnamed island and, in marital bliss, offered her name to the place: ''Korkyra'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek Mythology&quot;/&gt; which gradually evolved to ''Kerkyra'' ([[Doric Greek|Doric]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website&quot;/&gt; They had a child they called ''Phaiax'', after whom the inhabitants of the island were named ''[[Scheria|Phaiakes]]'', in [[Latin]] ''Phaeaciani''. Corfu's nickname is ''the island of the [[Phaeacians]]''.

The name Corfù, an Italian version of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Κορυφώ (Koryphō), meaning &quot;city of the peaks&quot;, derives from the [[Byzantine Greek]] Κορυφαί (Koryphai) (crests or peaks), denoting the two peaks of ''Palaio Frourio''.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Corfu topographic map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Corfu. Its satellite islands of [[Ereikoussa]], [[Othoni]] and [[Mathraki]] counterclockwise NW, WNW and W respectively (with respect to the northern part of the island at the top of the map) and [[Paxos (island)|Paxos]] and [[Antipaxos]] on the SE side, are visible.]]

The northeastern edge of Corfu lies off the [[coast]] of [[Sarandë]], [[Albania]], separated by straits varying in width from {{convert|3|to|23|km|0|abbr=in}}. The southeast side of the island lies off the coast of [[Thesprotia]], Greece. Its shape resembles a [[sickle]] (''drepanē, δρεπάνι''), to which it was compared by the ancients: the concave side, with the city and harbour of Corfu in the centre,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; lies toward the Albanian coast. With the island's area estimated at {{convert|592.9|km2|acre}},&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it runs approximately {{cvt|64|km}} long, with greatest breadth at around {{cvt|32|km}}.

Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the southern low-lying. The more important of the two ranges, that of [[Mount Pantokrator|Pantokrator]] (Παντοκράτωρ – the Almighty) stretches east and west from Cape Falacro to Cape Psaromita, and attains its greatest elevation in the summit of the same name.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Aghios Georgios Bay in Corfu.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Bay of [[Agios Georgios, Corfu|Agios Georgios]] in northwestern Corfu]]

The second range culminates in the mountain of Santi Jeca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek designation ''Άγιοι Δέκα'' (Hagioi Deka), or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Beaches are found in Agios Gordis, the [[Korission Lagoon]], Agios Georgios, Marathia, Kassiopi, Sidari, Palaiokastritsa and many others. Corfu is located near the [[Kefalonia]] geological fault formation; earthquakes have occurred.

Corfu's coastline spans {{convert|217|km|mi|0}} including capes; its highest point is [[Mount Pantokrator]] ({{convert|911|m|ft|0}}); and the second Stravoskiadi, at {{convert|abbr=on|849|m|ft|0}}. The full extent of capes and promontories take in Agia Aikaterini, Drastis to the north, Lefkimmi and Asprokavos to the southeast, and Megachoro to the south. Two islands are also to be found at a middle point of Gouvia and Corfu Bay, which extends across much of the eastern shore of the island; are known as Lazareto and Ptychia (or Vido).

===Diapontia Islands===
The [[Diapontia Islands]] (Greek: Διαπόντια νησιά) are located in the northwest of Corfu, (6&amp;nbsp;km away) and about 40&amp;nbsp;km from the Italian coast. The main islands are [[Othonoi]], [[Ereikoussa]] and [[Mathraki]].
[[File:Othonoi 1.jpg|thumb|Othoni Island]]

===Lazaretto Island===
[[File:Lazaretto island (Corfu).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Lazaretto Island]]]]

[[Lazaretto island (Corfu)|Lazaretto Island]], formerly known as St. Dimitrios, is located 1.1 km of the coast northeast of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]; the island has an area of {{convert|7.1|ha|1}} and comes under the administration of the Greek National Tourist Organization. During Venetian rule in the early 16th century, a monastery was built on the islet and a leprosarium established later in the century, after which the island was named. In 1798, during the French occupation, the islet was occupied by the [[Russia|Russo]]-Turkish fleet, who ran it as a military hospital. During the British occupation, in 1814, the leprosarium was once again opened after renovations, and following [[Enosis]] in 1864 the leprosarium again saw occasional use.&lt;ref name=&quot;koine&quot;/&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] established a [[Nazi concentration camp]] there for the prisoners of the [[Greek Resistance|Greek Resistance movement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel to Corfu&quot;/&gt; while remaining today are the two-storied building that served as the Headquarters of the Italian army, a small church, and the wall against which those condemned to death were shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;koine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koine.terapad.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&amp;newsID=10608&amp;from=list|title=Corfu honored with a new museum |publisher=Koine.terapad.com|access-date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel to Corfu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-to-corfu.com/page.php?id=46&amp;back=corfu.php|title=Travel to Corfu |publisher=Travel to Corfu|access-date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
[[Homer]] identifies six plants that adorn the garden of [[Alcinous]]: wild olive, pear, [[pomegranate]], apple, [[ficus|fig]] and [[Vitis vinifera|grape vine]]. Of these the apple and the pear are very inferior in Corfu; the others thrive, together with all the fruit trees known in southern Europe, with addition of the [[kumquat]], [[loquat]] and [[opuntia|prickly pear]] and, in some spots, the banana. Olive trees dominate and their combination with cypress trees compose the typical Corfiot landscape. When undisturbed by cultivation,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; the high [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] is the major natural vegetation type followed by deciduous oak forests and to a lesser extent, pine forests. In total more than 1800 plant species have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Panitsa, M. &amp; E. Iliadou 2013: FLORA AND PHYTOGEOGRAPHY OF THE IONIAN ISLANDS (Greece). 2nd Botanical Conference in Menorca.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
Corfu is a [[continental island]]; its fauna is similar to that of the opposite mainland.

====Birds====
Avifauna is extensive, with around 300 bird species recorded since the 19th century. Species vary in size from the [[greater flamingo]] to the [[goldcrest]].&lt;ref&gt;Gasteratos, I. unpublished data.&lt;/ref&gt; Some species have become extinct, such as the [[rock partridge]], or no longer breed on the island, like the [[eastern imperial eagle]] and [[Bonelli's eagle]].

====Mammals====
Around 40 species of mammals live on the island and in the sea around it. [[Fin whale]]s, [[sperm whale]]s, [[Cuvier's beaked whale]]s, [[common bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[short-beaked common dolphin]]s, [[striped dolphin]]s and [[Risso's dolphin]]s are the regularly present cetaceans. [[Mediterranean monk seal|Monk seals]] appear from time to time without breeding here any more. [[Eurasian otter]]s still survive in the lagoons and streams of Corfu.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz-Olmo, J. 2006: The Otter (Lutra lutra L.) on Corfu Island (Greece): Situation in 2006. IUCN Otter Spec. Group Bull. 23: 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European jackal|golden jackal]] was very common till the 1960s but after persecution it became extinct, with the last individuals observed in the first half of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masseti |first=M. |year=2010 |title=Homeless mammals from the Ionian and Aegean islands |journal=Bonn Zoological Bulletin |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=367–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasteratos, I. &amp; Z.

[[Red fox]]es, [[beech marten]]s, [[least weasel]]s, [[European hare]]s, [[northern white-breasted hedgehog]]s are quite easy to see as some of the smaller mammals as well as the bats. [[Coypu]]s, [[fallow deer]], [[Indian crested porcupine]]s, [[Siberian chipmunk]]s have been observed recently but they are escapees and only the coypu has viable population.

====Amphibians and reptiles====
Eight species of amphibians and 31 species of reptiles live or have been recorded on and around Corfu.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, B. &amp; M. Stille 2017: The Herpetofauna of Corfu and adjacent Islands.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lissotriton|Greek newt]], the [[Macedonian crested newt]], the [[common toad]], the [[European green toad]], the [[European tree frog]], the [[agile frog]], the [[Epirus water frog]] and the [[Balkan frog|Greek marsh frog]] are the representatives of the Amphibia Class.

[[Loggerhead sea turtle]]s nest on the sandy beaches. On land, the [[Hermann's tortoise]] is widespread while the [[marginated tortoise|marginated tortoise's]] status is unclear. In freshwater wetlands [[European pond turtle|European pond terrapins]] and [[Balkan pond turtle|Balkan terrapins]] are common but the last few years face the competition of the introduced [[pond slider]].

Lizard species include typical lizards and geckos like the [[Stellagama|starred agama]], the [[Mediterranean house gecko]], the [[Tarentola mauritanica|moorish gecko]], the [[blue-throated keeled lizard|Dalmatian algyroides]], the [[Podarcis muralis|common wall lizard]], the [[Podarcis tauricus|Balkan wall lizard]], the [[Balkan green lizard]], the [[European green lizard]] and the [[Ablepharus kitaibelii|snake-eyed skink]] as also the legless Greek slow worm and the [[Sheltopusik|European glass lizard]].

Of the snakes of Corfu only the [[Vipera ammodytes|nose-horned viper]] is potentially dangerous. The harmless snake list includes the [[Typhlops vermicularis|European worm snake]], the [[Eryx jaculus|javelin sand boa]], the [[Platyceps najadum|Dahl's whip snake]], the [[Balkan whip snake]], the [[Caspian whipsnake|Caspian whip snake]], the [[four-lined snake]], the [[Aesculapian snake]], the [[European ratsnake|leopard snake]], the [[grass snake]], the [[dice snake]], the [[European cat snake]], the eastern [[Malpolon monspessulanus|Montpellier snake]].

===Climate===
Corfu has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]).

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Dionysos Vacchos pediment at the Museum of Corfu.JPG|thumb|240px|A relief of [[Dionysus]] Bacchus at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]]]]

The earliest reference to Corfu is the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] word ''ko-ro-ku-ra-i-jo (''&quot;man from Kerkyra&quot;) written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script, c. 1300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=493 Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]], [[Korkyra (polis)|Corcyra]] (Κόρκυρα) was the [[Homer]]ic island of [[Scheria]] (Σχερία),&lt;ref name=Strabo&gt;''Strab. vi. p. 407''&lt;/ref&gt; and its earliest inhabitants were the [[Phaeacians]] (Φαίακες). The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory have not been found. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] depicts the island in ''[[Argonautica]]'' as a place visited by the Argonauts. [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were married there in 'Medea's Cave'. Apollonius named the island ''Drepane'', Greek for &quot;sickle&quot;, since it was thought to hide the sickle that [[Cronus]] used to castrate his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], from whose blood the Phaeacians were descended. In an alternative account, Apollonius identifies the buried sickle as a scythe belonging to [[Demeter]], yet the name ''Drepane'' probably originated in the sickle-shape of the island. According to a [[scholiast]], commenting on the passage in ''Argonautica'', the island was first of all called [[Macris]] after the nurse of [[Dionysus]] who fled there from [[Euboea]].&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), p. 409 n. 125–27; verses 4.982–992&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have asserted that Corfu was ''[[Taphos]]'', the island of the [[Leleges|Lelegian]] Taphians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goekoop2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Cees H. Goekoop|title=Where on Earth Is Ithaca?: A Quest for the Homeland of Odysseus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weJTNoX5TkQC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Eburon Uitgeverij B.V.|isbn=978-90-5972-344-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Strabo]] (VI, 269), the [[Liburnians]] were masters of the island ''Korkyra'' (Corfu), until 735 BC, when they left it, under pressure of [[Corinth]]ian ruler Hersikrates, in a period of Corinthian expansion to South [[Italy]], [[Sicily]] and Ionian Sea.

At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Corfu was peopled by settlers from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], probably 730 BC, but it appears to have previously received a stream of emigrants from [[Eretria]]. The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and [[Magna Grecia]], and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

This opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC according to [[Thucydides]]. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant [[Periander]] (Περίανδρος) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Anactorium]]. The island soon regained its independence and thenceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] over the control of [[Epidamnus]], and sought assistance from Athens (see [[Battle of Sybota]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

This new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the [[Peloponnesian War]], in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the [[Athens|Athenians]] as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. &quot;The Revolution in Corcyra.&quot; c. 400 BCE. Reprinted in Rogers, Perry. ''Aspects of Western Civilization.'' pp. 76–78. Pearson: Upper Saddle River. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] campaigns of Athens Corcyra served as a supply base; after a third abortive rising of the oligarchs in 410 BC it practically withdrew from the war. In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a [[Sparta]]n force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the [[Hellenistic]] period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 303 BC, after a vain siege by [[Cassander]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; the island was occupied for a short time by the [[Lacedaemonian]] general [[Cleonymus of Sparta]], then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by [[Agathocles of Syracuse]]. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] on her marriage to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], King of [[Epirus]]. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of [[Cassiope(city)|Cassiope]] was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval [[battle of Paxos]], it was captured by the [[Illyrians]], but was speedily delivered by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 31 BC, it served [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] (Augustus) as a base against [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Roman and medieval history===
[[File:Pontikonisi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pontikonisi]] island is home of the monastery of ''Pantokrator'' (Μοναστήρι του Παντοκράτορος). The Greek word Ποντικονήσι (''pontikonissi'') means “mouse island”; the white staircase of the monastery resembles from afar a mouse tail.]]
Christianity arrived in Corfu early; two disciples of [[Saint Paul]], Jason of Tarsus and Sosipatrus of Patras, taught the Gospel, and according to tradition the city of Corfu and much of the island converted to Christianity. Their relics were housed in the old cathedral (at the site of the current Old Fortress, before a dedicated church was built for them {{circa|100 AD}}.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=26–27}}

During [[Late Antiquity]] (late Roman/early Byzantine period), the island formed part of the province of [[Epirus Vetus]] in the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=28–29}} In 551, during the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]], the [[Ostrogoths]] raided the island and destroyed the city of Corfu, then known as ''Chersoupolis'' (Χερσούπολις, &quot;city on the promontory&quot;) because of its location between Garitsa Bay and Kanoni. Over the next centuries, the main settlement was moved north, to the location of the current Old Fortress, where the rocky hills offered natural protection against raids. From the twin peaks of the new site, the medieval city received its new name, ''Korypho'' (Κορυφώ, &quot;city on the peak&quot;) or ''Korphoi'' (Κορφοί, &quot;peaks&quot;), whence the modern Western name of &quot;Corfu&quot;. The previous site of the city, now known as ''Palaiopolis'' (Παλαιόπολις, &quot;old city&quot;), continued to be inhabited for several centuries, however.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=32–33}}

From at least the early 9th century, Corfu and the other Ionian Islands formed part of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Cephallenia (theme)|Cephallenia]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=30–31}} This naval theme provided a defensive bulwark for Byzantium against western threats, but also played a major role in securing the sealanes to the Byzantine [[Catepanate of Italy|possessions in southern Italy]]. Indeed, traveller reports from throughout the middle Byzantine period (8th–12th centuries) make clear that Corfu was &quot;an important staging post for travels between East and West&quot;.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=31–32, 33–34}} Indeed, the medieval name of Corfu first appears (Latinized ''Coryphus'') in [[Liutprand of Cremona]]'s account of his 968 embassy to the Byzantine court.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Corfu enjoyed relative peace and safety during the [[Macedonian dynasty]] (867–1054), which allowed the construction of a monumental church to Saints Iason and Sosipatrus outside the city wall of Palaiopolis.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Nevertheless, in 933, the city, led by its archbishop, Arsenios, withstood a [[Saracen]] attack; Arsenios was canonized and became the city's [[patron saint]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=34}}

The peace and prosperity of the Macedonian era ended with another Saracen attack in 1033, but more importantly with the emergence of a new threat: following the [[Norman conquest of Southern Italy]], the ambitious Norman monarchs set their sights on expansion in the East. Three times on the space of a century Corfu was the first target and served as a staging area for the [[Byzantine–Norman wars|Norman invasions of Byzantium]]. The first Norman occupation from 1081 to 1084 was ended only after the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] secured the aid of the [[Republic of Venice]], in exchange to wide-ranging commercial concessions to Venetian merchants. The admiral [[George of Antioch]] captured Corfu again in 1147, and it took a ten-month siege for [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to recover the island in 1149. In the third invasion in 1185, the island was again captured by [[William II of Sicily]], but was soon regained by [[Isaac II Angelos]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=36–38}}

During the break-up of the [[Byzantine Empire]] the island was occupied by [[Genoa|Genoese]] privateers (1197–1207), who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In 1214 it passed to the Greek [[despotate of Epirus|despots of Epirus]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; who gave it to [[Manfred of Sicily]] as a dowry in 1259.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Runciman|first1=Steven|title=The Sicilian Vespers|url=https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc|url-access=registration|date=1958|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-60474-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc/page/43 43]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his death in 1267 it passed with his other possessions to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|house of Anjou]]. Under the latter, the island suffered considerably from the inroads of various adventurers.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The island was one of the first places in Europe in which [[Romani people]] (&quot;Gypsies&quot;) settled. In about 1360, a [[fiefdom]], called the ''[[Feudum Acinganorum]]'' was established, with mainly Romani [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxA6JA49B4C&amp;q=%22Feudum+Acinganorum%22&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108|title=Bright Balkan Morning: Romani Lives and the Power of Music in Greek Macedonia|isbn=9780819564887|date=9 December 2002|last1=Keil|first1=Charles|last2=Keil|first2=Angeliki|last3=Feld|first3=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qHUdwpiYCtIC&amp;q=%22Feudum+Acinganorum%22&amp;pg=PA50 |pages=50–51|title=The Gypsies|isbn=9780631196051|date=23 February 1995|last1=Fraser|first1=Angus}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1386, Corfu was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], which in 1401 acquired formal sovereignty and retained it until the French Occupation of 1797.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Corfu became central for the propagation of the activities of the [[Filiki Etaireia]] among the [[Greek Diaspora]] and philhellenic societies across Europe, through nobles like [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and Dionysios Romas.

The effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications as well as the strength of some old Byzantine castles in [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]], [[Kassiopi Castle]], [[Gardiki Castle, Corfu|Gardiki]] and elsewhere, were additional factors that enabled Corfu to remain free. [[Will Durant]] claimed that Corfu owed to the [[Republic of Venice]] the fact that it was one of the few parts of Greece never conquered by the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant. ''The Renaissance''. page 684. MJF Books. New York, 1981 {{ISBN|1-56731-016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of attempts by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] to take the island began in 1431 when Ottoman troops under [[Ali Bey Evrenosoglu|Ali Bey]] landed on the island. The Ottomans tried to take the city castle and raided the surrounding area, but were repulsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corfuweb.gr/gb-history6.htm |title=History of Corfu |publisher=Corfuweb.gr |accessdate=29 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411090942/http://www.corfuweb.gr/gb-history6.htm |archivedate=11 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siege of Corfu (1537)]] was the first great siege by the Ottomans. It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt;

Thirty-four years later, in August 1571, Ottoman forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized [[Parga]] and [[Mourtos]] from the Greek mainland side, they attacked the [[Paxi]] islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building engineering skills. Another castle, [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]], situated on the northwest coast near [[Palaiokastritsa]] (Greek: Παλαιοκαστρίτσα meaning ''Old Castle place'') and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, also held out. The castle is a tourist attraction today.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt;
 
These defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive, and the Ottomans abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later they repeated their attempt. Coming from Africa after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas. Following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces, the Ottoman troops were forced to leave the city sailing away.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Gardiki Castle.jpg|thumb|Outer perimeter of the [[Gardiki Castle, Corfu|Gardiki Castle]] which provided defence to the southern part of the island]]

The [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|second great siege]] of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18)]]. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in [[Buthrotum]] opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt; The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the [[Corfu Channel]] and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|von der Schulenburg]] who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Corfu from xenos website&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070814153129/http://www.corfuxenos.gr/History/venetian.htm History of Corfu from xenos website]&lt;/ref&gt; The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds. The repulse of the Ottomans was widely celebrated in Europe, Corfu being seen as a bastion of [[western culture|Western civilization]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] tide.&lt;ref name=Scots/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge Illustrated&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492–1792 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=neUKEvaYPZYC&amp;pg=PA25 |accessdate= 6 July 2013 |year=1996 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-47033-9 |page=25 |quote= The Ottomans were a major and expanding presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa. ...

====Venetian policies and legacy====
Corfu's urban architecture differs from that of other major Greek cities, because of Corfu's unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. It was in the Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house ([[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]]) in Greece.

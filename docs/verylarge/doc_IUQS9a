The square where the central hall of [[Munich University]] is located has been named &quot;[[Geschwister-Scholl-Platz]]&quot; after Hans and Sophie Scholl; the square opposite to it is &quot;Professor-Huber-Platz&quot;. Two large fountains are in front of the university, one on either side of Ludwigstraße. The fountain in front of the university is dedicated to Hans and Sophie Scholl. The other, across the street, is dedicated to Professor Huber. Many schools, streets, and other places across Germany are named in memory of the members of the White Rose.

In Paris, a high school of the [[17th arrondissement of Paris|17th arrondissement]] (collège La Rose Blanche)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ac-paris.fr/serail/jcms/s2_1064115/fr/accueil&lt;/ref&gt;, is named after the White Rose, and a public park pays homage to Hans and Sophie Scholl.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paris.fr/equipements/jardin-hans-et-sophie-scholl-19654&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Germany's leading literary prizes is called the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]] (the &quot;Scholl Siblings&quot; prize). Likewise, the [[asteroid]] [[7571 Weisse Rose]] is named after the group.

{{more footnotes|section|date=April 2016}}
The following is a non-exhaustive chronological account of some of the more notable treatments of the White Rose in media, book and artistic form.
* Beginning in the 1970s, three film accounts of the White Rose resistance were produced. The first was a film financed by the Bavarian state government entitled ''Das Versprechen'' (''The Promise'') and released in the 1970s. The film is not well known outside [[Germany]], and to some extent even within the country. It was particularly notable in that unlike most films, it showed The White Rose from its inception and how it progressed. In 1982, [[Percy Adlon]]'s ''Fünf letzte Tage'' (''The Last Five Days'') presented [[Lena Stolze]] as Sophie in her last days from the point of view of her cellmate Else Gebel. In the same year, Stolze repeated the role in [[Michael Verhoeven]]'s ''[[Die Weiße Rose (film)|Die Weiße Rose]]'' (''The White Rose'').
* A book, ''Sophie Scholl and the White Rose'', was published in English in February 2006. An account by Annette Dumbach and Dr. [[Jud Newborn]] tells the story behind the film ''Sophie Scholl: The Final Days'', focusing on the White Rose movement while setting the group's resistance in the broader context of German culture and politics and other forms of resistance during the Nazi era.
* An [[opera]] ''[[Weiße Rose (opera)|Weiße Rose]]'' was produced by [[Udo Zimmermann]]
*''In memoriam: die weisse Rose'' by [[Hans Werner Henze]], ''[[Kommilitonen!]]''
*An opera by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]
*A 2017 organ piece by Carlotta Ferrari&lt;ref&gt;{{IMSLP|work=Die Weiße Rose (Ferrari, Carlotta)|cname=Die Weiße Rose (Ferrari, Carlotta)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lillian Garrett-Groag]]'s play, ''[[The White Rose (play)|The White Rose]]'', premiered at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in 1991.
* In February 1993, the Long Island newspaper ''[[Newsday]]'', commemorated the 50th anniversary of the execution of Probst and Scholl siblings. [[Lillian Garrett-Groag]] called the White Rose “…possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance in the 20th century” and Jud Newborn stated, “The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but it’s a very important value.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Andrew |title=The White Rose: A Story of Unsurpassed Courage |journal=The Objective Standard |volume=15 |issue= 2 |pages=23–27 |publisher=Glen Allen Press |date=Summer 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, after the 70th anniversary of the executions, ''Newsday'' published an article, “Story of courage amid horrors of holocaust.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hanc |first=John |title=Story of courage amid horrors of holocaust |newspaper=Newsday |location=Long Island |date=30 March 2013 |url=https://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/story-of-courage-amid-horrors-of-holocaust-1.4925210}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an extended German national TV competition held in the autumn of 2003 to choose &quot;the ten greatest Germans of all time&quot; ([[ZDF TV]]), Germans under the age of 40 placed Hans and Sophie Scholl in fourth place, selecting them over [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. Not long before, women readers of the mass-circulation magazine ''[[Brigitte (magazine)|Brigitte]]'' had voted Sophie Scholl as &quot;the greatest woman of the twentieth century&quot;.
* In February 2005, a movie about Sophie Scholl's last days, ''[[Sophie Scholl – Die letzten Tage]]'' (''Sophie Scholl: The Final Days''), featuring actress [[Julia Jentsch]] as Sophie, was released. Drawing on interviews with survivors and transcripts that had remained hidden in [[East Germany|East German]] archives until 1990, it was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in January 2006.

The '''Battle of Lake Benacus''' was fought along the banks of [[Lake Garda]] in northern [[Italy]], which was known to the Romans as Benacus, in 268&lt;ref name=jacques/&gt; or early 269 CE,&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt; between the army under the command of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius II]] and the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] tribes of the [[Alamanni]] and [[Juthungi]].&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt;

== Background ==
Ιn 268, the Alamanni, who had been making incursions into Roman territory since the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], had broken through the Roman frontier at the [[Danube]] and crossed the [[Alps]]. The power struggles in [[Mediolanum]] due to [[Aureolus]]' revolt, the murder of Emperor [[Gallienus]] and the resulting confrontation between Aureolus and [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius]], who had been nominated as emperor by Gallienus on his death bed, forced the Romans to denude the frontier of troops.&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt; Having defeated and killed Aureolus in a siege on Mediolanum, Claudius led his army, together with the remnants of Aureolus' force, north to confront the Germans.&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt;&lt;ref name=beckett&gt;{{cite book|last=A'Beckett|first=William|title=A Universal Biography|year=1836|publisher=Isaac, Tuckey, and Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eLo5AAAAcAAJ/page/n833 825]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eLo5AAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=universal&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathurst|first=C.|title=An Universal History: From the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time, Part 1, Volume 14|year=1780|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8I-AAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battle==
Details of the battle are unknown, but future Emperor [[Aurelian]] was present at the battle.&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt; After what was described as a decisive victory, Claudius assumed the title Germanicus Maximus.&lt;ref name=Watson43/&gt;&lt;ref name=beckett/&gt; Much of the German force was slaughtered on the field with the remainder retreating beyond the bounds of the Empire.&lt;ref name=universal/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Claudius returned to Rome after the battle to attend to affairs of state.&lt;ref name=beckett/&gt; The Alemanni returned to Italy in 271 and won a victory against Emperor [[Aurelian]] at the [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Battle of Placentia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jacques&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacques|first=Tony|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|page=562|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; before their ultimate defeat in the [[Battle of Fano]].

'''Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya''' ({{lang-hu|[[Vitéz]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vitéz&quot; refers to a Hungarian knightly order founded by Miklós Horthy (&quot;Vitézi Rend&quot;); literally, &quot;vitéz&quot; means &quot;knight&quot; or &quot;valiant&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; nagybányai Horthy Miklós}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈviteːz ˈnɒɟbaːɲɒi ˈhorti ˈmikloːʃ}}; English: '''Nicholas Horthy''';&lt;ref&gt;Owen Rutter, Averil Mackenzie-Grieve, Lily Doblhoff (baroness.): Regent of Hungary: the authorized life of Admiral Nicholas Horthy&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Nikolaus Horthy Ritter von Nagybánya}}; 18 June 1868{{spaced ndash}}9 February 1957) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[admiral]] and statesman, who became the [[regent of Hungary]]. He served as [[regent]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] [[Hungary between the two world wars|between World Wars I and II]] and throughout most of [[World War II]], from 1 March 1920 to 15 October 1944.

Horthy started his career as a sub-lieutenant in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1896 and attained the rank of [[rear-admiral]] in 1918. He saw action in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] and became commander-in-chief of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] Navy in the last year of the [[First World War]]; he was promoted to [[vice-admiral]] and commander of the Fleet when the previous admiral was dismissed from his post by [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor-King Charles]] following mutinies. In 1919, following [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|a series of revolutions and external interventions in Hungary]] from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Horthy returned to Budapest with the National Army and was subsequently invited to become regent of the kingdom by parliament. Horthy led a [[national conservative]]&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland: ''A History of Political Trials: From Charles I to Saddam Hussein'', Peter Lang Ltd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; government through the [[interwar period]], banning the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] as well as the [[Arrow Cross Party]], and pursuing an [[irredentist]] foreign policy in the face of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The former king, Charles, unsuccessfully attempted twice to return to Hungary until, in 1921, the Hungarian Government caved in to Allied threats to renew hostilities. Charles was escorted out of Hungary into exile.

In the late 1930s, Horthy's foreign policy led him into a reluctant alliance with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. With the begrudging support of [[Adolf Hitler]], Hungary was able to redeem certain areas ceded to neighbouring countries by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Under Horthy's leadership, Hungary gave support to [[Poles|Polish]] refugees in 1939 and participated in a supportive (as opposed to front-line) role in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941]].

Horthy's reluctance to contribute to the German war effort and the [[Holocaust in Hungary]], as well as refusing to hand over more than 600,000 of the 825,000 [[Hungarian Jews]] to German authorities, coupled with several attempts to strike a secret deal with the [[Allies of World War II]] after it had become obvious that the Axis would lose the war, eventually led the Germans to invade and take control of the country in March 1944 in [[Operation Margarethe]]. In October 1944, Horthy announced that Hungary had declared an armistice with the Allies and withdrawn from the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. He was forced to resign, placed under arrest by the Germans and taken to [[Bavaria]]. At the end of the war, he came under the custody of American troops.&lt;ref&gt;von Papen, Franz, ''Memoirs'', London, 1952, pps:541-23, 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya was born at [[Kenderes]] to an untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British gentry),  descended from István Horti, ennobled by [[Ferdinand II of Hungary|King Ferdinand II]] in 1635.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bencsik|first=Gábor|title=Horthy Miklós|publisher=Magyar Mercurius|location=Budapest|year=2004|isbn=9638552859|edition= 4. javított|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, István Horthy de Nagybánya, was a member of the [[House of Magnates]], the upper chamber of the [[Diet of Hungary]], and lord of a 1,500 acre estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Családfa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.euweb.cz/hung/horthy.html|author=Genealogy Euweb|title=Horthy de Nagybánya family|accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Hungarian noblewoman Paula Halassy de Dévaványa in 1857.&lt;ref name=&quot;Családfa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Homo Monarchicus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bencsik|first=Gábor|title=Homo Monarchicus – Az első 25 év|publisher=Rubicon Történelmi Magazin, 2007/10. szám|location=Budapest|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miklós was the fourth of their eight children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horthy|first=Nicholas|url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/horthy/horthy.pdf|title=Memoirs (Annotated by Andrew L.

Horthy entered the Austro-Hungarian &quot;Imperial and Royal Naval Academy&quot; (k.u.k. Marine-Akademie) at Fiume (now [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]) at age 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/272477/Miklos-Nagybanyai-Horthy |title=Miklos Horthy (Hungarian statesman) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=9 February 1957 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the official language of the naval academy was [[German language|German]], Horthy spoke Hungarian with a slight, but noticeable, Austro-German accent for the rest of his life. He also spoke [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Croatian (language)|Croatian]], [[English (language)|English]], and [[French (language)|French]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Homo Monarchicus&quot;/&gt;

As a young man, Horthy travelled around the world and served as a diplomat for [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and other countries. Horthy married [[Magdolna Purgly|Magdolna Purgly de Jószáshely]] in Arad in 1901. They had 4 children: Magdolna (1902), Paula (1903), [[István Horthy|István]] (1904) and [[Miklós Horthy, Jr.|Miklós]] (1907). From 1911 until 1914, he was a naval [[aide-de-camp]] to Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], for whom he had a great respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerWood1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Spencer Tucker|author2=Laura Matysek Wood|title=The European powers in the First World War: an encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHI3PCjDtsUC&amp;pg=PA348|year=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-0-8153-0399-2|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of World War I, Horthy was commander of the pre-dreadnought battleship {{SMS|Habsburg}}. In 1915, he earned a reputation for boldness while commanding the new light cruiser {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}}. He planned the 1917 attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]], which resulted in the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]], the largest naval engagement of the war in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. A consolidated British, French and Italian fleet met the Austro-Hungarian force. Despite the numerical superiority of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] fleet, the Austrian force emerged from the battle victorious. The Austrian fleet remained relatively unscathed, however Horthy was wounded. After the [[Cattaro mutiny]] of February 1918, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] selected Horthy over many more senior commanders as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Fleet in March 1918. In June, Horthy planned another attack on Otranto, and in a departure from the cautious strategy of his predecessors, he committed the empire's battleships to the mission. While sailing through the night, the dreadnought {{SMS|Szent István}} met Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS torpedo boats]] and was sunk, causing Horthy to abort the mission. He managed to preserve the rest of the empire's fleet until he was ordered by Emperor Charles to surrender it to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (the predecessor of Yugoslavia) on 31 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;TuckerWood1996&quot;/&gt;

The end of the war saw Hungary turned into a landlocked nation, and with that, the new government had little need for Horthy's naval expertise. He retired with his family to his private estate at [[Kenderes]].

==Interwar period, 1919–1939==
Historians agree on the conservatism of interwar Hungary, Historian [[István Deák]] states:
:Between 1919 and 1944 Hungary was a rightist country. Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a “nationalist Christian”  policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th century. The governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism’s instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and Freemasonry. They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy.&lt;ref&gt; István Deák, “Hungary”  in Hans Rogger and Egon Weber,eds., ''The European right: A historical profile'' (1963) p 364-407 quoting p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commander of the National Army===
[[File:Filmhíradók - 100 éve ezen a héten 38. (2019. november 11-17.).webm|thumb|350px|Horthy enters Budapest, 16 November 1919 (1080p film footage)]]
Two national traumas that followed the First World War profoundly shaped the spirit and future of the Hungarian nation. The first was the loss, as dictated by the [[Allies of World War I]], of large portions of Hungarian territory that had bordered other countries. These were lands that had belonged to Hungary (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) but were now ceded mainly to [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. The excisions, eventually ratified in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, cost Hungary two-thirds of its territory and one-third of its native Hungarian speakers; this dealt the population a terrible psychological blow. The second trauma began in March 1919, when the Communist leader [[Béla Kun]] seized power in the capital, [[Budapest]], after the first proto-democratic government in Hungary faltered.&lt;ref&gt;Lázár, István, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Budapest: Corvina, 1993 (English edition) Translated by Albert Tezla; Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|With the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Kingdom of Hungary lost 72% of its territory (including [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia]]) and 3.3 million people of Hungarian ethnicity.]]
Kun and his colleagues proclaimed a [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and promised the restoration of Hungary's former grandeur. Instead, his efforts at reconquest failed, and Hungarians were treated to a Soviet-style repression in the form of [[Lenin Boys|armed gangs]] who intimidated or murdered enemies of the regime. This period of violence came to be known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Deak, Istvan, &quot;A Hungarian Admiral on Horseback&quot;, from ''Essays on Hitler's Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2001, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

Within weeks of his coup, Kun's popularity plummeted. On 30 May 1919, anti-Communist politicians formed a counter-revolutionary government in the southern city of [[Szeged]], which was occupied by French forces at the time. There, [[Gyula Károlyi]], the prime minister of the counter-revolutionary government, asked former admiral Horthy, still considered a war hero, to be the Minister of War in the new government and take command of a counter-revolutionary force that would be named the National Army ({{lang-hu|Nemzeti Hadsereg}}). Horthy consented, and he arrived in Szeged on 6 June. Soon afterwards, because of orders from the Allied powers, a cabinet was reformed, and Horthy was not given a seat in it. Undaunted, Horthy managed to retain control of the National Army by detaching the army command from the War Ministry.

After the Communist government collapsed and its leaders fled, French-supported Romanian forces entered Budapest on 6 August 1919. In retaliation for the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]], reactionary crews now exacted revenge in a two-year wave of violent repression known today as the [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]]. These reprisals were organized and carried out by officers of Horthy's National Army, particularly [[Pál Prónay]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469&quot;&gt;Patai, Raphael, ''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 468–469&lt;/ref&gt; Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek and Iván Héjjas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodo&quot;&gt;Bodó, Béla: ''Paramilitary Violence in Hungary After the First World War'', East European Quarterly, No. 2, Vol. 38, 22 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Their victims were primarily [[Communist]]s, [[Social Democrats]], and Jews. Most Hungarian Jews were not supporters of the Bolsheviks, but much of the leadership of the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been young Jewish intellectuals, and anger about the Communist revolution easily translated into anti-Semitic hostility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patai, Raphael pp. 468-469&quot;/&gt;

In Budapest, Prónay installed his unit in the Hotel Britannia, where the group swelled to [[battalion]] size. Their program of vicious attacks continued; they planned a citywide [[pogrom]] against the Jews until Horthy found out and put a stop to it. In his diary, Prónay reported that Horthy:&lt;blockquote&gt;reproached me for the many Jewish corpses found in the various parts of the country, especially in the Transdanubia. This, he emphasized, gave the foreign press extra ammunitions against us. He told me that we should stop harassing small Jews; instead, we should kill some big (Kun government) Jews such as Somogyi or Vázsonyi – these people deserve punishment much more... in vain, I tried to convince him that the liberal papers would be against us anyway, and it did not matter that we killed only one Jew or we killed them all&lt;ref&gt;Szabo and Pamlenyi: ''A hatarban a halal kaszal'', pp.160 and 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The degree of Horthy's responsibility for the excesses of Prónay is disputed. On several occasions, Horthy reached out to stop Prónay from a particularly excessive burst of anti-Jewish cruelty, and the Jews of Pest went on record absolving Horthy of the White Terror as early as the fall of 1919, when they released a statement disavowing the Kun revolution and blaming the terror on a few units within the National Army. Horthy has never been found to have personally engaged in White Terror atrocities.  But his American biographer [[Thomas L. Sakmyster]] concluded that he &quot;tacitly supported the right wing officer detachments&quot; who carried out the terror;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sakmyster | first = Thomas L. | authorlink = Thomas L. Sakmyster | title = Hungary's Admiral on Horseback: Miklós Horthy, 1918–1944 | publisher = Columbia University Press = date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horthy called them &quot;my best men&quot;.{{r|gunther1940}} The admiral also had practical reasons for overlooking the terror his officers wrought, since he needed the dedicated officers to help stabilize the country. Nevertheless, it was at least another year before the terror died down. In the summer of 1920, Horthy's government took measures to rein in and eventually disperse the reactionary battalions. Prónay managed to undermine these measures, but only for a short time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodo&quot; /&gt; Prónay was put on trial for extorting a wealthy Jewish politician, and for &quot;insulting the President of the Parliament&quot; by trying to cover up the extortion. Found guilty on both charges, Prónay was now a liability and an embarrassment. His command was revoked, and he was denounced as a common criminal on the floor of the Hungarian parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodo&quot; /&gt;

After serving short jail sentences, Prónay tried to convince Horthy to restore his battalion command. The Prónay Battalion lingered for a few months more under the command of a junior officer, but the government officially dissolved the unit in January 1922 and expelled its members from the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodo&quot; /&gt; Prónay entered politics as a member of the government's right-wing opposition. In the 1930s, he sought and failed to emulate the Nazis by generating a Hungarian fascist mass movement. In 1932, he was charged with incitement, sentenced to six months in prison and stripped of his rank of lieutenant colonel. Prónay would support the pro-Nazi [[Arrow Cross]] and lead attacks on Jews before being captured by Soviet troops sometime during or after the [[Battle of Budapest]] of 1944–45, dying in captivity in 1947/48.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodo&quot; /&gt;

Precisely how much Horthy knew about the excesses of the White Terror is not known. Horthy himself declined to apologize for the savagery of his officer detachments, writing later, &quot;I have no reason to gloss over deeds of injustice and atrocities committed when an iron broom alone could sweep the country clean.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Horthy |first=Admiral Nicholas|others=Nicholas Horthy, Miklós Horthy, Andrew L. Simon, Nicholas Roosevelt|title=Admiral Nicholas Horthy Memoirs |publisher=Simon Publications LLC|year=2000 |edition=illustrated |page=348 |isbn=0-9665734-3-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qpzqnn95AHIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He endorsed Edgar von Schmidt-Pauli's poetic justification of the White reprisals (&quot;Hell let loose on earth cannot be subdued by the beating of angels' wings&quot;) remarking, &quot;the Communists in Hungary, willing disciples of the Russian Bolshevists, had indeed let hell loose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) in an internal report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army and a kind of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the International Committee of the Red Cross, from Sarajevo to Hiroshima.|last=Durand|first=André|publisher=Henry Dunant Institute|year=1984|isbn=9782880440091|location=Geneva|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into a fateful alliance with Adolf Hitler.&lt;blockquote&gt;The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, on the banks of the Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the [[Crown of St. Stephen|Holy Crown]] and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin our property and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer we approached to this city, the more rapidly did the ice in our hearts melt. We are now ready to forgive her.&lt;ref name=&quot;1919speech&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.horthy.hu/images/kormanyzoirasai/beszedbudapest/beszedbudapest_nagy.jpg|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070701004854/http://www.horthy.hu/images/kormanyzoirasai/beszedbudapest/beszedbudapest_nagy.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-01|title=1919 speech of Horthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:HorthyGellért.jpg|left|thumb|Admiral Miklós Horthy enters Budapest at the head of the National Army, 16 November 1919.

Following the pressure of the Allied powers, Romanian troops finally evacuated Hungary on 25 February 1920.

===Regent===
On 1 March 1920, the National Assembly of Hungary re-established the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1944)|Kingdom of Hungary]].  It was apparent that the Allies of World War I would not accept any return of King Charles IV (the former Austro-Hungarian emperor) from exile. Instead, with National Army officers controlling the parliament building, the assembly voted to install Horthy as [[Regent]]; he defeated Count [[Albert Apponyi]] by a vote of 131 to 7.

Bishop [[Ottokár Prohászka]] then led a small delegation to meet Horthy, announcing, &quot;Hungary's Parliament has elected you Regent! Would it please you to accept the office of Regent of Hungary?&quot; To their astonishment, Horthy declined, unless the powers of the office were expanded. As Horthy stalled, the politicians gave in to his demands and granted him &quot;the general prerogatives of the king, with the exception of the right to name titles of nobility and of the patronage of the Church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; The prerogatives he was given included the power to appoint and dismiss prime ministers, to convene and dissolve parliament, and to command the [[Royal Hungarian Army|armed forces]]. With those sweeping powers guaranteed, Horthy took the oath of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sakmyster|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was styled ''His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary'' ({{lang-hu|Ő Főméltósága a Magyar Királyság Kormányzója}}). (Charles I did try to regain his throne twice; see [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary]] for more details.)
[[File:Flag of the Supreme Warlord of the Royal Hungarian Defence Forces (1939-1945, on land).svg|right|thumb|Standard of Miklós Horthy]]
The Hungarian state was legally a kingdom, but it had no king, as the Allied powers would not have tolerated any re-instatement of the Habsburg dynasty. The country retained its [[parliamentary system]] following the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], with a prime minister appointed as head of government. As head of state, Horthy retained significant influence through his constitutional powers and the loyalty of his ministers to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Deak, Istvan, &quot;A Fatal Compromise? The Debate Over Collaboration and Resistance in Hungary,&quot; in ''The Politics of Retribution: World War II and Its Aftermath'', edited by Deak, Gross, and Judt, Princeton University Press, pp. 39–52&lt;/ref&gt; Although his involvement in drafting legislation was minuscule, he nevertheless had the ability to ensure that laws passed by the Hungarian parliament conformed to his political preferences.

===Seeking redress for the Treaty of Trianon===

The first decade of Horthy's reign was primarily consumed by stabilizing the Hungarian economy and political system. Horthy's chief partner in these efforts was his prime minister [[István Bethlen]]. It was commonly known that Horthy was an [[Anglophile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomas L. | last = Sakmyster | authorlink = Thomas L. Sakmyster | title = Hungary's Admiral on Horseback: Miklós Horthy, 1918–1944 | publisher = East European Monographs | date = 1994 | pages = 156, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Carmilly-Weinberger: ''The road to life: the rescue operation of Jewish refugees on the Hungarian-Romanian border in Transylvania, 1936–1944''. Shengold, 1994. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau – Monika Platzer: ''Shaping the great city: modern architecture in Central Europe, 1890–1937''. Prestel, 1999. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and British political and economic support played a significant role in the stabilization and consolidation of the early Horthy era in the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Walters: ''The Other Europe: Eastern Europe To 1945''. Syracuse University Press, 1988. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlen sought to stabilize the economy while building alliances with weaker nations that could advance Hungary's cause. That cause was, primarily, reversing the losses of the Treaty of Trianon. The humiliations of the Trianon treaty continued to occupy a central place in Hungarian foreign policy and the popular imagination. The indignant anti-Trianon slogan &quot;Nem, nem soha!&quot; (&quot;No, no never!&quot;) became a ubiquitous motto of Hungarian outrage. When in 1927 the British newspaper magnate [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] denounced the partitions ratified at Trianon in the pages of his ''Daily Mail'', an official letter of gratitude was eagerly signed by 1.2 million Hungarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

But Hungary's stability was precarious, and the [[Great Depression]] derailed much of Bethlen's economic balance. Horthy replaced him with an old reactionary confederate from his Szeged days: [[Gyula Gömbös]]. Gömbös was an outspoken anti-Semite and a budding fascist. Although he agreed to Horthy's demands that he temper his anti-Jewish rhetoric and work amicably with Hungary's large Jewish professional class, Gömbös's tenure began swinging Hungary's political mood powerfully rightward. He strengthened Hungary's ties to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italian fascist state. Fatefully, when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933, he found in Gömbös an admiring and obliging colleague.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[John Gunther]] stated that Horthy,

{{quote|though reactionary as far as social or economic ideas are concerned, is in effect the guardian of constitutionalism and what vestigial democracy remains in the country, because it is largely his influence that prevents any prime minister from abolishing parliament and setting up dictatorial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunther1940&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n443/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=422–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gömbös rescued the failing economy by securing trade guarantees from Germany – a strategy that positioned Germany as Hungary's primary trading partner and tied Hungary's future even more tightly to Hitler's. He also assured Hitler that Hungary would quickly become a one-party state modelled on the Nazi party control of Germany. Gömbös died in 1936, before he realized his most extreme goals, but he left his nation headed into firm partnership with the German dictator.

===Uneasy alliance===
Hungary now entered into intricate political maneuvers with the regime of Adolf Hitler, and Horthy began to play a greater and more public role in navigating Hungary along this dangerous path.

Many of these churches were originally part of one of the above families and so are closely related to them by way of ethos and [[Liturgy|liturgical practice]]. As in the other Eastern churches, married men may become priests, and parish priests administer the [[sacrament|mystery]] of [[confirmation]] to newborn infants immediately after baptism, via the rite of chrismation; the infants are then administered [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]].

The Syro-Malabar Church, which is part of the Saint Thomas Christian community in India, follows East Syriac traditions and liturgy. Other Saint Thomas Christians of India, who were originally of the same East Syriac tradition, passed instead to the West Syriac tradition and now form part of Oriental Orthodoxy (some from the Oriental Orthodox in India united with the Catholic Church in 1930 and became the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]). The [[Maronite Church]] claims never to have been separated from Rome, and has no counterpart Orthodox Church out of communion with the Pope. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to it as a &quot;Uniate&quot; Church. The [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church]] has also never been out of communion with Rome, but, unlike the Maronite Church, it resembles the [[Byzantine Rite|liturgical rite]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

=== Dissenting movements ===
[[File:Ukrlckremenec.jpg|thumb|upright|The Church of the Cross of the Lord is located in [[Kremenets]] and is part of the [[Ukrainian Lutheran Church]], which uses the Byzantine Rite.]]
In addition to these four mainstream branches, there are a number of much smaller groups which originated from disputes with the dominant tradition of their original areas. Most of these are either part of the more traditional [[Old Believer]] movement, which arose from a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] within Russian Orthodoxy, or the more radical [[Spiritual Christianity]] movement. The latter includes a number of diverse &quot;[[Low church|low-church]]&quot; groups, from the Bible-centered [[Molokan]]s to the anarchic [[Doukhobor]]s to the self-mutilating [[Skoptsy]]. None of these groups are in communion with the mainstream churches listed above, aside from a few Old Believer parishes in communion with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. There are also national dissidents, where ethnic groups want their own nation-church, such as the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]]; both are domiciles of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. There are also some [[Protestantism|Reformed]] Churches which share characteristics of Eastern Christianity, to varying extents.

====&quot;True Orthodox&quot; churches====
{{Main|True Orthodoxy}}
Starting in the 1920s, [[Greek Old Calendarists|parallel hierarchies]] formed in opposition to local Orthodox churches over ecumenism and other matters. These jurisdictions sometimes refer to themselves as being &quot;True Orthodox&quot;. In Russia, underground churches formed and maintained solidarity with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia until the late 1970s. There are now traditionalist Orthodox in every area, though in Asia and the Middle East their presence is negligible.

==== Protestant Eastern Churches ====
{{Main|Protestant Eastern Christianity}}
[[Protestant Eastern Christianity]] comprises a collection of heterogeneous Protestant denominations which are mostly the result of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches adopting reformational variants of [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] liturgy and worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Believers Eastern Church |url=https://www.bec.org/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Church History |url=http://steci.org/church-history/ |website=St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India (steci) is an episcopal Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some others are the result of [[reformation]]s of [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] beliefs and practices, inspired by the teachings of Western Protestant missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heritage – Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church |url=http://marthoma.in/the-church/heritage/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denominations of this category include the [[Ukrainian Lutheran Church]], [[St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India]], [[Believers Eastern Church]], [[Evangelical Orthodox Church]], etc.

===== Byzantine Rite Lutheranism =====
{{Main|Byzantine Rite Lutheranism}}
[[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism]] arose in the Ukrainian Lutheran Church around 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;HämmerliMayer2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hämmerli|first1=Maria|last2=Mayer|first2=Jean-François|title=Orthodox Identities in Western Europe: Migration, Settlement and Innovation|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=en|isbn=9781317084914|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sprung up in the region of Galicia and its rites are based on the [[Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom|Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bebis2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omhksea.org/2013/03/the-divine-liturgy-of-saint-john-chrysostom-used-by-the-ukrainian-lutheran-church-and-its-missing-elements/|title=The Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, used by the Ukrainian Lutheran Church, and its missing elements|last=Bebis|first=Vassilios|date=30 March 2013|publisher=[[Eastern Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia]]|language=en|access-date=18 September 2018|quote=A revised Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is also celebrated in Ukraine by members of the Ukrainian Lutheran Church.

== Catholic–Orthodox ecumenism ==
Ecumenical dialogue since the 1964 meeting between [[Pope Paul VI]] and Orthodox Patriarch [[Athenagoras I]] has awoken the nearly 1000-year hopes for Christian unity. Since the lifting of excommunications during the Paul VI and Athenagoras I meeting in Jerusalem there have been other significant meetings between Popes and Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople. One of the most recent meetings was between Benedict XVI and Bartholomew I, who jointly signed the ''Common Declaration''. It states that &quot;We give thanks to the Author of all that is good, who allows us once again, in prayer and in dialogue, to express the joy we feel as brothers and to renew ''our commitment to move towards '''full communion'''''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecupatriarchate.org/ |title=Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople |publisher=Ecupatriarchate.org |access-date=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Patriarch [[Bartholomew I]] attended the installation ceremony of the new Roman Catholic Pope, [[Pope Francis|Francis]], which was the first time any Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had ever attended such an installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=auto|url=http://orthodoxyandheterodoxy.org/2013/03/21/the-first-ecumenical-patriarch-at-a-papal-inauguration-not-just-since-1054/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of Uniatism ===
At a meeting in [[Balamand]], [[Lebanon]], in June 1993, the Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church declared that these initiatives that &quot;led to the union of certain communities with the See of Rome and brought with them, as a consequence, the breaking of communion with their Mother Churches of the East … took place not without the interference of extra-ecclesial interests&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930624_lebanon_en.html SEVENTH PLENARY SESSION (Vatican Website)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223144638/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930624_lebanon_en.html |date=December 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that what has been called &quot;[[uniatism]]&quot; &quot;can no longer be accepted either as a method to be followed nor as a model of the unity our Churches are seeking&quot; (section 12).

At the same time, the Commission stated:
* 3) Concerning the Eastern Catholic Churches, it is clear that they, as part of the Catholic Communion, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful.
* 16) The Oriental Catholic Churches who have desired to re-establish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the rights and obligations which are connected with this communion.
* 22) Pastoral activity in the Catholic Church, Latin as well as Oriental, no longer aims at having the faithful of one Church pass over to the other; that is to say, it no longer aims at proselytizing among the Orthodox. It aims at answering the spiritual needs of its own faithful and it has no desire for expansion at the expense of the Orthodox Church. Within these perspectives, so that there will be no longer place for mistrust and suspicion, it is necessary that there be reciprocal exchanges of information about various pastoral projects and that thus cooperation between bishops and all those with responsibilities in our Churches, can be set in motion and develop.

== Migration trends ==
There has been a significant Christian migration in the 20th century from the Near East. Fifteen hundred years ago Christians were the majority population in today's Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Egypt. In 1914 Christians constituted 25% of the population of the Ottoman Empire. At the beginning of the 21st century Christians constituted 6% – 7% of the region's population: less than 1% in Turkey, 3% in Iraq, 12% in Syria, 39% in Lebanon, 6% in Jordan, 2.5% in Israel/Palestine and 15–20% in Egypt.

As of 2011 Eastern Orthodox Christians are [[American upper class|among the wealthiest]] Christians in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, having a high number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] (68%) and [[post-graduate]] (28%) degrees per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|date=February 2008|access-date=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of Christians in the Islamic culture ==

Christians, especially Nestorians, contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads]] and the [[Abbasids]] by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald.

A hospital and medical training center existed at [[Gundeshapur]]. The city of Gundeshapur was founded in AD 271 by the Sassanid king [[Shapur I]]. It was one of the major cities in [[Khuzestan]] province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population was Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of [[Khusraw I]], refuge was granted to Greek [[Nestorian Christian]] philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] ([[Urfa]]), also called the Academy of [[Athens]], a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences 22:2'' Mehmet Mahfuz Söylemez, ''The Jundishapur School: Its History, Structure, and Functions'', p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Marlow Taylor, ''The Physicians of Gundeshapur'', (University of California, Irvine), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Elgood, ''A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate'', (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah.

[[Arab Christians]] and Arabic-Speaking Christians especially [[Maronites]] played important roles in [[Al-Nahda]], and because Arab Christians formed the educated [[upper class|upper]] and bourgeois classes, they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture, and most important figures of the Al-Nahda movement were Christian Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131019093522/http://miradaglobal.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1643%3Amarcha-historica-de-los-arabes-iel-tercer-momento&amp;catid=27%3Apolitica&amp;Itemid=16&amp;lang=en] &quot;The historical march of the Arabs: the third moment.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Arab Christians]] still play important roles in the Arab world, and Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-belt/pope-to-arab-christians-k_b_203943.html|title=Pope to Arab Christians: Keep the Faith|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=20 April 2016|date=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Great Lent''', or the '''Great Fast''', ([[Greek Language|Greek]]: Μεγάλη Τεσσαρακοστή or Μεγάλη Νηστεία, meaning &quot;Great 40 Days,&quot; and &quot;Great Fast,&quot; respectively) is the most important [[fasting]] season in the [[church year]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] (including [[Byzantine Rite]] and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]]), [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Rite Lutheran Churches]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which prepares Christians for the greatest feast of the church year, [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter).&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://risu.org.ua/ua/index/exclusive/kaleidoscope/63352/|title=Лютерани східного обряду: такі є лише в Україні|last=Moroz|first=Vladimir|date=10 May 2016|publisher=РІСУ - Релігійно-інформаційна служба України|language=uk|access-date=19 September 2018|quote=В українських лютеран, як і в ортодоксальних Церквах, напередодні Великодня є Великий Піст або Чотиридесятниця.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Lent shares its origins with the [[Lent|Lent of Western Christianity]] and has many similarities with it. There are some differences in the timing of Lent (besides calculating the date of Easter) and how it is practiced, both liturgically in the public worship of the church and individually.

One difference between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity is the calculation of the date of Easter (see [[Computus]]). Most years, the Eastern Pascha falls after the Western Easter, and it may be as much as five weeks later; occasionally, the two dates coincide. Like Western Lent, Great Lent itself lasts for forty days, but in contrast to the West, Sundays are included in the count.

Great Lent officially begins on [[Clean Monday]], seven weeks before [[Easter|Pascha]] ([[Ash Wednesday]] is not observed in Eastern Christianity), and runs for 40 contiguous days, concluding with the Presanctified Liturgy on Friday of the Sixth Week. The next day is called [[Lazarus Saturday]], the day before [[Palm Sunday]]. (Thus, in case the Easter dates coincide, Clean Monday is two days before Ash Wednesday.)

Fasting continues throughout the following week, known as Passion Week or [[Holy Week]], and does not end until after the [[Paschal Vigil]] early in the morning of Pascha (Easter Sunday).

==Purpose==
[[Image:Crucifixion by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Crucifixion''. [[Icon]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]] (16th century, [[Stavronikita monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]

The purpose of Great Lent is to prepare the faithful to not only commemorate, but to enter into the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus]]. The totality of the Byzantine Rite life centers around the Resurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;LT_Meaning&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Lent is intended to be a &quot;workshop&quot; where the character of the believer is spiritually uplifted and strengthened; where his life is rededicated to the principles and ideals of the Gospel; where [[fasting]] and prayer culminate in deep conviction of life; where apathy and disinterest turn into vigorous activities of faith and good works.

Lent is not for the sake of Lent itself, as fasting is not for the sake of fasting. Rather, these are means by which and for which the individual believer prepares himself to reach for, accept and attain the calling of his Savior. Therefore, the significance of Great Lent is highly appraised, not only by the [[monk]]s who gradually increased the length of time of the Lent, but also by the [[laity|lay people]] themselves. The Orthodox lenten rules are the monastic rules. These rules exist not as a Pharisaic law, “burdens grievous to be borne” {{bibleverse|Luke|11:46|KJV}}, but as an ideal to be striven for; not as an end in themselves, but as a means to the purification of heart, the enlightening of mind, the liberation of soul and body from sin, and the spiritual perfection crowned in the virtue of love towards God and man.

In the Byzantine Rite, [[asceticism]] is not exclusively for the &quot;professional&quot; religious, but for each layperson as well, according to their strength. As such, Great Lent is a sacred Institute of the Church to serve the individual believer in participating as a member of the [[Body of Christ|Mystical Body of Christ]]. It provides each person an annual opportunity for self-examination and improving the standards of faith and morals in his Christian life. The deep intent of the believer during Great Lent is encapsulated in the words of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]: &quot;forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus&quot; ({{bibleverse||Philippians|3:13-14|KJV}}).

Through spending more time than usual in prayer and meditation on the Holy Scripture and the [[Holy Tradition]]s of the Church, the believer in Christ becomes through the grace of God more godlike. The attitude towards this period is very positive, it is not so much a period of repentance, as the &quot;West&quot; think of it, as an attempt to recapture our true state as it was for Adam and Eve before the fall - to live pure lives.

==Observance==

===Self-discipline===
Observance of Great Lent is characterized by [[fasting]] and [[abstinence]] from certain foods, intensified private and public prayer, self-examination, [[Confession (religion)|confession]], personal improvement, [[repentance]] and [[restitution]] for sins committed, and [[almsgiving]].

The foods abstained from are meat, fish, eggs and dairy products, wine, and oil. According to some traditions, only olive oil is abstained from; in others, all vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abbamoses.com/fasting.html|title=The Fasting Rule of the Orthodox Church|website=www.abbamoses.com|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While wine and oil are permitted on Saturdays, Sundays, and a few feast days, and fish is permitted on [[Palm Sunday]] as well as the [[Annunciation]] when it falls before Palm Sunday, and caviar is permitted on [[Lazarus Saturday]], meat and dairy are prohibited entirely until the fast is broken on Easter.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fasting Rule of the Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abbamoses.com/fasting.html | title=The Fasting Rule of the Church | publisher=abbamoses.com | access-date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the additional liturgical celebrations described below, Christians are expected to pay closer attention to and increase their private prayer.  According to Byzantine Rite [[theology]], when asceticism is increased, prayer must be increased also. The [[Church Fathers]] have referred to fasting without prayer as &quot;the fast of the demons&quot; since the demons do not eat according to their incorporeal nature, but neither do they pray.

===Liturgical observances===
[[Image:Pope Gregory I.jpg|thumb|[[Saint]] [[Gregory Dialogus]], who is credited with compiling the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]].]]

Great Lent is unique in that, liturgically, the weeks do not run from Sunday to Saturday, but rather begin on Monday and end on Sunday, and most weeks are named for the lesson from the Gospel which will be read at the Divine Liturgy on its concluding Sunday. This is to illustrate that the entire season is anticipatory, leading up to the greatest Sunday of all: Pascha.

During the Great Fast, a special service book is used, known as the [[Triodion|Lenten Triodion]], which contains the Lenten texts for the [[Daily Office]] (Canonical Hours) and Liturgies.  The Triodion begins during the Pre-Lenten period to supplement or replace portions of the regular services. This replacement begins gradually, initially affecting only the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings, and gradually increases until Holy Week when it entirely replaces all other liturgical material (during the [[Triduum]] even the [[Psalter]] is eliminated, and all texts are taken exclusively from the Triodion). The Triodion is used until the lights are extinguished before midnight at the [[Paschal Vigil]], at which time it is replaced by the [[Pentecostarion]], which begins by replacing the normal services entirely (during [[Bright Week]]) and gradually diminishes until the normal services resume following the [[Afterfeast]] of [[Pentecost]].

On the weekdays of Great Lent, the full [[Divine Liturgy]] is not celebrated, because the joy of the [[Eucharist]] (literally &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;) is contrary to the attitude of repentance which predominates on these days. Since it is considered especially important to receive the [[Holy Mysteries]] (Holy Communion) during this season, the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]]—also called the Liturgy of [[Pope Gregory I|St. Gregory the Dialogist]]— may be celebrated on weekdays. This service commences with [[Vespers]] during which [[Lamb (liturgy)|a portion]] of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]], which was [[reserved Sacrament|reserved]] the previous Sunday, is brought to the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis table]]. This is followed by a solemn [[Entrance (liturgical)#Great Entrance|great entrance]] where the Holy Mysteries are brought to the altar table, and then, skipping the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora (eucharistic prayer)]], the outline of remainder of the divine liturgy is followed, including [[Eucharist|holy communion]]. Most [[parish church|parishes]] and [[monasteries]] celebrate this liturgy only on Wednesdays, Fridays and [[feast day]]s, but it may be celebrated on any weekday of Great Lent.  Because the divine liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays, the [[Typica#Liturgical service|Typica]] occupies its place in the [[Canonical_hours#Byzantine_Rite_usage#Daily Cycle of services|canonical hours]], whether or not a liturgy is celebrated at vespers. On Saturday and Sunday the Divine Liturgy may be celebrated as usual. On Saturdays, the usual [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]] is celebrated; on Sundays the longer [[Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] is used.

The services of the [[Canonical Hours]] are much longer during Great Lent and the structure of the services is different on weekdays. The usual evening [[Compline#Small Compline|small compline]] is replaced by the much longer service of [[Great Compline]].  While in the Russian tradition Great Compline is used on Friday night (though some parts are read rather than sung and some Lenten material is replaced by non-Lenten hymns), in the Greek practice, ordinary Compline is used together with, on the first four weeks, a quarter of the [[Akathist#Akathist to the Theotokos|Akathist to the Theotokos]]. On the fifth Saturday, known as the Saturday of the Akathist, everywhere, the entire Akathist is sung at Matins.

==== Theme of Lenten joy ====
A difference between the Eastern and Western observances is that while in the West the chanting of [[Alleluia]] ceases during [[Lent]], in the East its use is increased. This is because for Christians, fasting should be joyous (cf. {{bibleverse||Matthew|6:16|KJV}}), and the sense of unworthiness must always be tempered with hope in God's forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In fact, days which follow the Lenten pattern of services are referred to as &quot;days with Alleluia&quot;. This theme of &quot;Lenten joy&quot; is also found in many of the hymns of the Triodion, such as the [[sticheron|stichera]] which begin with the words: &quot;The Lenten Spring has dawned!...&quot; ([[Vespers]] [[Aposticha]], Wednesday of Cheesefare Week) and &quot;Now is the season of repentance; let us begin it joyfully, O brethren...&quot; ([[Matins]], Second [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], Ode 8, Monday of Cheesefare Week).

The making of [[prostration]]s during the services increases as well. The one [[prayer]] that typifies the Lenten services is the [[Prayer of Saint Ephrem]], which is said at each service on weekdays, accompanied by [[poklon|full prostrations]]. One translation of it reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O Lord and master of my life! a spirit of idleness, despondency, ambition and idle-talking, give me not. 
But rather, a spirit of chastity, humble-mindedness, patience and charity, bestow upon me Thy servant. 
Yea, my king and Lord, grant me to see my own failings and refrain from judging others: For blessed art Thou unto ages of ages. Amen. 
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The public reading of [[Scripture]] is increased during Great Lent. The [[Psalter]] ([[Book of Psalms]]), which is normally read through once a week, is read through twice each week for the six weeks prior to Holy Week.  Readings from the [[Old Testament]] are also increased, with the Books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] being read through almost in their entirety at the [[Sext|Sixth Hour]] and [[Vespers]] (during Cheesefare Week, the readings at these services are taken from [[Book of Joel|Joel]] and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], while during Holy Week they are from [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Job|Job]]). Uniquely, on weekdays of Great Lent there is no public reading of the [[Epistle]]s or [[Gospel]]s. This is because the readings are particular to the divine liturgy, which is not celebrated on weekdays of Great Lent. There are, however, Epistles and Gospels appointed for each Saturday and Sunday.

====Prayer for the dead====
[[Image:MHS Sad Ostateczny XVII w Lipie p.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Last Judgment]] is a repeating theme of Great Lent (17th-century icon from Lipie, [[Poland]]).]]

During the Great Fast, the church also increases its [[prayer for the dead]], not only reminding the believer of his own mortality, and thus increasing the spirit of penitence, but also to remind him of his Christian obligation of charity in praying for the departed. A number of Saturdays during Great Lent are [[Saturday of the dead|Saturdays of the Dead]], with many of the hymns of the Daily Office and at the Divine Liturgy dedicated to remembrance of the departed. These Saturdays are:
*The Saturday of Meatfare Week
*The Second Saturday of Great Lent
*The Third Saturday of Great Lent
*The Fourth Saturday of Great Lent
In addition, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|Lity]], a brief prayer service for the departed, may be served on each weekday of Great Lent, provided there is no [[feast day]] or special observance on that day.

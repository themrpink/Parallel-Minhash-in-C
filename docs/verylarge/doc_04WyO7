A '''World Heritage Site''' is a landmark or area with legal protection by an  international convention administered by the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO for having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance.

==History==
===Origin===
In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist them to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ |title=Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705131757/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=22 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of several important temples. The most famous of these are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign ended in 1980 and was considered a success. To thank countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples; the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |title=The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705131914/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=22 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost US$80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHC-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention – Brief History / Section &quot;Preserving cultural heritage&quot; |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526200434/https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns, such as saving [[Venice]] and [[Venetian Lagoon|its lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. Together with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], UNESCO then initiated a draft convention to protect cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHC-history&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|World Heritage Committee}}
The United States initiated the idea of safeguarding places of high cultural or natural importance. A [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a &quot;World Heritage Trust&quot; to preserve &quot;the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry&quot;. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, which were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;convention1&quot;/&gt; Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a 'snapshot' of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

Based on the draft convention that UNESCO had initiated, a single text was eventually agreed on by all parties, and the &quot;Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage&quot; was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;convention1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention – Brief History / Section &quot;Linking the protection of cultural and natural heritage&quot; |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=17 July 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526200434/https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of June 2020, it has been ratified by 193 states parties:&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=18 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526200633/https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 189 [[member states of the United Nations|UN member states]], 2 [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Present non-member observer states|UN observer states]] (the [[Holy See]] and the [[State of Palestine]]) and 2 [[Associated state#States currently in a formal association|states in free association]] with [[New Zealand]] (the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]). Only four UN member states have not ratified the convention: [[Liechtenstein]], [[Nauru]], [[Somalia]] and [[Tuvalu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |title=Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705132021/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |archivedate=5 July 2020 |accessdate=22 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives and positive results==
By assigning places as World Heritage Sites, UNESCO wants to help to pass them on to future generations. Its motivation is that “[h]eritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today” and that both cultural and natural heritage are “irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration”.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt; UNESCO's mission with respect to World Heritage consists of eight subtargets. These include encouraging the commitment of countries and local population to World Heritage conservation in various ways, providing emergency assistance for sites in danger, offering technical assistance and professional training, and supporting States Parties' public awareness-building activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt;

Being listed as a World Heritage Site can positively affect the site, its environment, and interactions between them. A listed site gains international recognition and legal protection, and can obtain funds from among others the World Heritage Fund to facilitate its conservation under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/funding/ |title=Funding |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=30 May 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530074900/https://whc.unesco.org/en/funding/ |archivedate=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO reckons the restorations of the following four sites among its success stories: [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the Old City of [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia, the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] near Kraków in Poland, and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/107/#successful |title=Success stories - successful restorations |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=30 May 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530085037/https://whc.unesco.org/en/107/ |archivedate=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the local population around a site may benefit from significantly increased tourism revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurel&quot; /&gt; When there are significant interactions between people and the natural environment, these can be recognised as &quot;cultural landscapes&quot;.{{efn|This type of recognition exists since 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelectionCriteria&quot;/&gt;}}

==Nomination process==
A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites into a document known as the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on its Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File, which is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once a year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List; sometimes it defers its decision or requests more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one to be included on the list.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHS Guidelines&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ |title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=10 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/https://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ |archivedate=14 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that now there is only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot; and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelectionCriteria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ |title=Criteria for Selection |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=14 October 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/https://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ |archivedate=12 June 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or amended several times since their creation.

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or to modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHS Guidelines&quot;/&gt; A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significant impact on the extent of the property or affect its &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;, is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHS Guidelines&quot;/&gt; Proposals to change a site's official name are sent directly to the committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHS Guidelines&quot;/&gt;

==Endangerment==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if conditions threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanisation or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO-WHinDanger&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=10 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705132146/https://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |archivedate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed yearly; after this, the Committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHS Guidelines&quot;/&gt; Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362 |title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary : first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705132243/https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362 |archivedate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction. However, after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522 |title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/ |archivedate=7 July 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure threats to Natural World Heritage Sites found that 63 per cent of sites have been damaged by increasing human pressures including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades.&lt;ref name=forestloss&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2016.12.011 |title=Recent increases in human pressure and forest loss threaten many Natural World Heritage Sites |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=206 |pages=47–55 |year=2017 |last1=Allan |first1=James R. |last2=Venter |first2=Oscar |last3=Maxwell |first3=Sean |last4=Bertzky |first4=Bastian |last5=Jones |first5=Kendall |last6=Shi |first6=Yichuan |last7=Watson |first7=James E.M. |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:417883/UQ417883_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/ncomms12558 |pmid = 27552116 |pmc = 4996975 |title = Sixteen years of change in the global terrestrial human footprint and implications for biodiversity conservation |journal = [[Nature Communications]] |volume = 7 |pages = 12558 |year = 2016 |last1 = Venter |first1 = Oscar |last2 = Sanderson |first2 = Eric W. |last3 = Magrach |first3 = Ainhoa |last4 = Allan |first4 = James R. |last5 = Beher |first5 = Jutta |last6 = Jones |first6 = Kendall R. |last7 = Possingham |first7 = Hugh P. |last8 = Laurance |first8 = William F. |last9 = Wood |first9 = Peter |last10 = Fekete |first10 = Balázs M. |last11 = Levy |first11 = Marc A. |last12 = Watson |first12 = James E.

Of the Natural World Heritage Sites that contain forest, 91 per cent experienced some loss since 2000. Many of them are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.&lt;ref name=forestloss/&gt;

Furthermore, the destruction of cultural assets and identity-establishing sites is one of the primary goals of modern asymmetrical warfare. Therefore, terrorists, rebels and mercenary armies deliberately smash archaeological sites, sacred and secular monuments and loot libraries, archives and museums. The [[UN]], [[United Nations peacekeeping]] and [[UNESCO]] in cooperation with [[Blue Shield International]] are active in preventing such acts. &quot;No strike lists&quot; are also created to protect cultural assets from air strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Peter |last1=Stone |title=Monuments Men: protecting cultural heritage in war zones |publisher=[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo – The International Art Magazine]] |date= 2 February 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2020 |url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/inquiry-monuments-men/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526201349/https://www.apollo-magazine.com/inquiry-monuments-men/ |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mehroz |last1=Baig |title=When War Destroys Identity |publisher=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]] |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2020 |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-war-destroys-identity_b_5290161 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526201558/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-war-destroys-identity_b_5290161 |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UNESCO Director-General calls for stronger cooperation for heritage protection at the Blue Shield International General Assembly |publisher=UNESCO |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2020 |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_director_general_calls_for_stronger_cooperation_for_h/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526201857/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_director_general_calls_for_stronger_cooperation_for_h/ |archivedate=26 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|O’Keefe|Péron|Musayev|Ferrari|2016}} However, only through cooperation with the locals can the protection of World Heritage Sites, archaeological finds, exhibits and archaeological sites from destruction, looting and robbery be implemented sustainably.

==Critique==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO-administered project has attracted criticism. This was caused by perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barron |first1=Laignee |title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism |accessdate=3 September 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=30 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200527103655/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism |archivedate=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vallely |first1=Paul |title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=7 November 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html |archivedate=27 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing can significantly increase tourism returns. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|author=T.G. |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=20 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317 |archivedate=15 July 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled &quot;World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate&quot;.

==Statistics==
{{Main|List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription}}

[[File:Unesco_world_heritage_sites.png|thumb|upright=1.1|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]
The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America and Caribbean zone. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe and North America region because the British government nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification {{as of|2020|06|lc=y}}:&lt;ref name=&quot;WHList&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region |title=World Heritage List (ordered by region) |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705125635/https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region |archivedate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat |title=World Heritage List Statistics |author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705130603/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat |archivedate=5 July 2020 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Gecko''' is a [[browser engine]] developed by [[Mozilla]]. It is used in the [[Firefox]] browser, the [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] [[email client]], and many other projects.

Gecko is designed to support [[Open standard|open]] [[web standards|Internet standards]], and is used by different applications to display [[web page]]s and, in some cases, an application's [[user interface]] itself (by rendering [[XML User Interface Language|XUL]]). Gecko offers a rich programming [[application programming interface|API]] that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in Internet-enabled applications, such as [[web browsers]], content presentation, and [[client/server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.mozilla.org/projects/embedding/ |title = Embedding Mozilla |publisher = Mozilla.org |date = 2012-10-25 |accessdate = 2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of the layout engine now known as Gecko began at [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] in 1997, following the company's purchase of [[DigitalStyle]]. The existing Netscape rendering engine, originally written for [[Netscape Navigator]] 1.0 and upgraded through the years, was slow, did not comply well with W3C standards, had limited support for [[dynamic HTML]] and lacked features such as incremental reflow (when the layout engine rearranges elements on the screen as new data is downloaded and added to the page). The new layout engine was developed in parallel with the old, with the intention being to integrate it into Netscape Communicator when it was mature and stable. At least one more major revision of Netscape was expected to be released with the old layout engine before the switch.

After the launch of the Mozilla project in early 1998, the new layout engine code was released under an open-source license. Originally unveiled as ''Raptor'', the name had to be changed to ''NGLayout'' (next generation layout) due to [[trademark]] problems. Netscape later rebranded NGLayout as ''Gecko''. While [[Mozilla Organization]] (the forerunner of the [[Mozilla Foundation]]) initially continued to use the NGLayout name (Gecko was a Netscape trademark),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/gecko.html |title=nglayout project: identity crisis |publisher=Mozilla.org |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629154746/http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/gecko.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually the Gecko branding won out.

In October 1998, Netscape announced that its next browser would use Gecko (which was still called NGLayout at the time) rather than the old layout engine, requiring large parts of the application to be rewritten. While this decision was popular with web standards advocates, it was largely unpopular with Netscape developers, who were unhappy with the six months given for the rewrite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins_interview&quot;/&gt; It also meant that most of the work done for [[Netscape 5|Netscape Communicator 5.0]] (including development on the [[Mariner (layout engine)|Mariner]] improvements to the old layout engine) had to be abandoned. Netscape 6, the first Netscape release to incorporate Gecko, was released in November 2000 (the name Netscape 5 was never used).

As Gecko development continued, other applications and embedders began to make use of it. [[America Online]], by this time Netscape's parent company, eventually adopted it for use in [[CompuServe]] 7.0 and AOL for Mac OS X (these products had previously embedded Internet Explorer). However, with the exception of a few [[development stage|betas]], Gecko was never used in the main [[Microsoft Windows]] AOL client.

On July 15, 2003, AOL laid off the remaining Gecko developers and the Mozilla Foundation (formed on the same day) became the main steward of Gecko development. Today, Gecko is developed by employees of the [[Mozilla Corporation]], employees of companies that contribute to the Mozilla project, and volunteers.

In October 2016, Mozilla announced [[#Quantum|Quantum]], an ongoing project encompassing several [[software development]] efforts to &quot;build the next-generation web engine for [[Firefox]] users&quot;. It includes numerous improvements to Gecko, taken from the experimental [[Servo (layout engine)|Servo]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuantWiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum|title=Quantum|website=Mozilla Wiki|accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QuantAnnounce&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/mozilla-announces-quantum-a-new-browser-engine-for-firefox-509767.shtml|title=Mozilla Announces Quantum, a New Browser Engine for Firefox|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|newspaper=softpedia|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox 57, also known as &quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;, first shipping in November 2017, is the initial version with major components from the Quantum/Servo projects enabled. These include increased performance in the [[CSS]] and [[GPU]] rendering components. Additional components will be merged from Servo to Gecko incrementally in future versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuantWiki&quot; /&gt;

In September 2018, Mozilla announced GeckoView, the foundation of Mozilla's next generation of mobile products based on a software library that makes Gecko reusable for Android, encompassing newer software development efforts to &quot;decouple the engine itself from its user interface, and made it easy to embed in other applications&quot;. Firefox Focus 7.0, shipped in the same month,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techdows.com/2018/09/firefox-focus-7-0-to-use-geckoview-gecko-engine.html|title=Firefox Focus 7.0 enters beta, Switches to GeckoView (Gecko Engine)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the initial version introduced GeckoView, with increased performance in median page loading.&lt;ref name=&quot;focus-with-geckoview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/09/focus-with-geckoview/|title=Firefox Focus with GeckoView|date=September 13, 2018|website=Mozilla Hacks|access-date=September 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/whats-new-firefox-focus-android-version-7|title=What's new in Firefox Focus for Android (version 7) {{!}} Firefox Focus Help|website=support.mozilla.org|language=en-US|access-date=September 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox Reality was also built with GeckoView.&lt;ref name=&quot;focus-with-geckoview&quot; /&gt; In June 2019, Mozilla announced Firefox Preview as an ongoing project that focuses on building Android web browser with GeckoView.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/06/geckoview-in-2019/|title=GeckoView in 2019|date=June 27, 2019|website=Mozilla Hacks|access-date=September 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox for Android 79, also known as &quot;Firefox Daylight&quot;, first shipping in August 2020, is the first stable release of that with major components powered by GeckoView engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=August 25, 2020|title=Fast, personalized and private by design on all platforms: introducing a new Firefox for Android experience|author=Vesta Zare|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/25/introducing-a-new-firefox-for-android-experience/|access-date=September 22, 2020|website=Mozilla Blog|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards support==
{{Update section|date=September 2020}}
{{Firefox TOC}}

From the outset, Gecko was designed to support open Internet standards. Some of the standards Gecko supports include:

* [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] Level 2.1 (partial support for CSS 3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla_CSS_support_chart |title = Mozilla CSS support chart |publisher = Developer.mozilla.org |date = 2012-08-04 |accessdate = 2012-10-31 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140405095628/https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla_CSS_support_chart |archive-date = 2014-04-05 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Document Object Model|DOM]] Level 1 and 2 (partial support for DOM 3)
* [[HTML]]4 (partial support for [[HTML5]]—see [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML5)]])
* [[JavaScript]] 1.8.5 (full [[ECMAScript]] 5.1 support),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/ECMAScript_5_support_in_Mozilla |title = ECMAScript 5 support in Mozilla |publisher = Developer.mozilla.org |date = 2013-11-14 |accessdate = 2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented in [[SpiderMonkey]]
* [[MathML]]
* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]
* [[XForms]] (via an official extension)
* [[XHTML]] 1.0
* [[XML]] 1.0
* [[XSLT]] and [[XPath]], implemented in [[TransforMiiX]]

Gecko also partially supports [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/status.html |title = Mozilla SVG Status |publisher = Mozilla.org |date = 2012-08-25 |accessdate = 2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SVG font, color profile, animation, view, and cursor modules are yet to be implemented and the filter and text modules are only partially implemented. The extensibility module is also implemented but is currently disabled.

In order to support [[web page]]s designed for legacy versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer, Gecko supports [[document type declaration|DOCTYPE]] switching. Documents with a modern DOCTYPE are rendered in standards compliance mode, which follows the [[W3C]] standards strictly. Documents that have no DOCTYPE or an older DOCTYPE are rendered in [[quirks mode]], which emulates some of the non-standard oddities of [[Netscape Communicator]] 4.x; however, some of the 4.x features (such as [[Layer (HTML tag)|layers]]) are not supported.

Gecko also has limited support for some non-standard Internet Explorer features, such as the [[marquee element]] and the &lt;code&gt;document.all&lt;/code&gt; property (though pages explicitly testing for &lt;code&gt;document.all&lt;/code&gt; will be told it is not supported).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=5063 |title = Mozilla Adds Undetectable document.all Support, Part of New Novell Linux Distribution?|publisher = Developer.mozilla.org |date = 2004-07-23 |accessdate = 2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;Web browsers&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Usage==
Gecko is primarily used in [[web browser]]s, the earliest being [[Netscape 6]] and [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla Suite]] (later renamed [[SeaMonkey]]). It is also used in other Mozilla web browser derivatives such as [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] and [[Firefox for mobile]] and the implementation of the [[Internet Explorer]]-clone that is part of [[Wine (software)|Wine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IE Wine Gecko&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wiki.winehq.org/Gecko |title = IE Uses Gecko Under Wine |publisher = Wine Wiki |accessdate = 2009-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozilla also uses it in their [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird email-client]].

Other web browsers using Gecko include [[GNU IceCat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/working-together/gang/gecko|title=Gecko|last=sdubois|date=24 June 2010|website=Free Software Foundation|access-date=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waterfox]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]], [[Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition|Portable Firefox]], [[Conkeror]], [[Classilla]], [[TenFourFox]].

Other products using Gecko include [[Nightingale (software)|Nightingale]], [[Instantbird]] and Google's picture-organization software [[Picasa]] (for Linux).&lt;ref name=&quot;picasa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picasa.google.com/linux/download.html#picasa30 |title=Picasa 3.0 for Linux |accessdate=2008-12-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107022711/http://picasa.google.com./linux/download.html |archive-date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gecko is also used by [[Sugar (GUI)|Sugar]] for the [[OLPC XO-1]] computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;sugarui&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/01/03/Hnsugarinterface_1.html |title=One Laptop Per Child readies 'Sugar' interface |last=Martens |first=China |publisher=IDG News Service |date=2007-01-03 |accessdate=2007-12-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118115757/http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/01/03/Hnsugarinterface_1.html |archive-date=2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gecko is used as a complete implementation of the [[XUL]] ([[XML]] User Interface Language). Gecko currently defines the XUL specification.

=== Past users ===
Products that formerly used Gecko include [[Pale Moon (web browser)|Pale Moon]] (now using [[Goanna (software)|Goanna]]), Epiphany (now known as [[GNOME Web]] and  using [[WebKitGTK]]), and [[GNOME DevHelp]] (now using [[WebKitGTK]].)

Discontinued products that used Gecko include [[Swiftfox]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[Galeon]], [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]], [[Minimo]], [[Beonex Communicator]], [[Kazehakase]], [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]],  [[Mozilla Sunbird|Sunbird (calendar)]], and [[MicroB]].

=== Proprietary dependency ===
On Windows and other platforms, Gecko depends on proprietary compilers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites|title=Building Firefox for Windows|website=MDN Web Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[FOSS]] distributions of [[Linux]] can not include the Gecko package&lt;!-- currently #define GECKO_VERSION &quot;2.47&quot; --&gt; used in the Windows compatibility layer [[Wine (software)|Wine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.jswindle.com/index.php/Fedora#Working_Wine {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611003752/http://wiki.jswindle.com/index.php/Fedora#Working_Wine |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gecko 2.0, the version number was bumped to 5.0 to match Firefox 5, and from then on has been kept in sync with the major version number for both Firefox and Thunderbird,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Gecko versions and application versions |url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Versions |work = [[Mozilla Developer Network|MDN]] |accessdate = 2013-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the fact that it is no longer a separate component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Not much in new Thunderbird 5, but roadmap looks promising |url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/06/not-much-in-new-thunderbird-5-but-roadmap-looks-promising/ |website = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = 2018-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bloat==
In the Netscape era, a combination of poor technical and management decisions resulted in Gecko [[software bloat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2004/06/collins-interview/2/ |title = Ars Technica sits down with Scott Collins from Mozilla.org |author = Jorge O. Castro |website = Ars Technica |date = 2004-06-15 |accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FestaCnet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dbaron-complexity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbaron.org/log/2003-01#l20030109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728082253/http://dbaron.org/log/2003-01 |title=Thursday 2003-01-09 |work=David Baron's weblog |author=David Baron |publisher=self-published |date=2003-01-09 |archive-date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2017-02-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in 2001 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] chose to fork [[KHTML]], not Gecko, to create the [[WebKit]] [[browser engine|engine]] for its [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;FestaCnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-980492.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025015655/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-980492.html |title=Apple snub stings Mozilla |author=Paul Festa |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |date=2003-01-14 |archive-date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2017-02-16 |author-link=Paul Festa |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dbaron-complexity&quot;/&gt; However, by 2008 Mozilla had addressed some of the bloat problems, resulting in big performance improvements for Gecko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/09/mozilla-committed-to-gecko/ |author = Ryan Paul |title = Why Mozilla is committed to Gecko as WebKit popularity grows |date = 2008-09-09 |accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum==
'''Quantum''' is a [[Mozilla]] project encompassing several [[software development]] efforts to &quot;build the next-generation web engine for [[Firefox]] users&quot;. It includes numerous improvements to Gecko, largely incorporated from the experimental [[Servo (layout engine)|Servo]] project. Quantum also includes refinements to the user interface and interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuantWiki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/mozilla-announces-quantum-a-new-browser-engine-for-firefox-509767.shtml|title=Mozilla Announces Quantum, a New Browser Engine for Firefox|last=Cimpanu|first=Catalin|newspaper=softpedia|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefox 57, released in November 2017, is the initial version with a Servo component enabled. Mozilla dubs this and several planned future releases &quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;57notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/57.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 57.0, See All New Features, Updates and Fixes|website=Mozilla|accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introFFQuantum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/|title=Introducing the New Firefox: Firefox Quantum – The Mozilla Blog|website=The Mozilla Blog|accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In 2013, Mozilla began the experimental [[Servo (layout engine)|Servo project]], which is an engine designed from scratch with the goals of improving [[Parallel computing|concurrency and parallelism]] while also reducing [[memory safety]] vulnerabilities. An important factor is writing Servo in the [[Rust programming language]], also created by Mozilla, which is designed to generate [[compiler|compiled]] code with better memory safety, concurrency, and parallelism than compiled C++ code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Servo_paper&quot;/&gt;

As of April 2016, Servo needed at least several years of development to become a full-featured browser engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Remaining-work/0e3b111807c2ed4c11f36d6bd47dda6dfa02d502|title=Servo remaining work|website=GitHub |accessdate=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the decision to start the Quantum project to bring stable portions of Servo into Firefox.

===Component===
The Quantum project is composed of several sub-projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuantWiki&quot;/&gt;

* '''CSS''': [[Servo (layout engine)|Servo]]'s parallel [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheet]] system integrated into [[Gecko (software)|Gecko]]. Benchmarks suggest that performance scales linearly with number of [[CPU]] cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://changelog.com/podcast/228|website=The Changelog|title=The Changelog|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was released in Firefox 57.&lt;ref name=&quot;introFFQuantum&quot;/&gt;
* '''Render''': Servo's [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] architecture, called WebRender, integrated into Gecko. WebRender replaces the [[Immediate mode (computer graphics)|immediate mode]] drawing model with a [[retained mode]] model that is more easily accelerated by the [[GPU]] by taking advantage of CSS/DOM's similarity to a [[scene graph]]. Worst-case scenario rendering in testing exceeds 60 frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-february-2016/|title=Bay Area Rust Meetup February 2016|website=Air Mozilla|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozilla began enabling the new renderer for select hardware/OS combinations in Firefox 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/WebRender_Where|title=Webrender Where|website=Mozilla Wiki|accessdate=2020-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Compositor''': Gecko's existing [[compositing|compositor]] moved to its own process, isolating browser tabs from graphics driver related crashes. Since compositor crashes will not bring down the browser content process, the compositor process can be restarted transparently without losing user data. This was released in Firefox 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/04/19/first-big-bytes-project-quantum/|title=Firefox faster and more stable with the first big bytes of Project Quantum, simpler with compact themes and permissions redesign|website=Mozilla Blog|accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''DOM''': Loosely inspired by Servo's Constellation architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an5abNFba4Q |title=Servo Architecture|website=YouTube|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]'s [[Presto (layout engine)|Presto]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://billmccloskey.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/mozillas-quantum-project/|title=Mozilla's Quantum Project|website=Bill McCloskey's Blog|accessdate=2017-03-28|date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum DOM uses cooperatively scheduled threads within the [[Document Object Model|DOM]] to increase responsiveness without increasing the number of processes and, thus, memory usage. The core of this shipped in Firefox 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/|title=Entering the Quantum Era|date=2017-11-13|website=Mozilla Hacks|accessdate=2020-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Flow''': An umbrella for user visible performance improvements driven by a team that works across Gecko components. Focused on real user performance improvements on major [[Web application|webapps]], primarily [[G Suite]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Flow|title=Quantum Flow|website=Mozilla Wiki|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work completed and shipped for Firefox 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2017-09-21/quantum-flow-engineering-newsletter-25/|title=Quantum Flow Engineering Newsletter #25|date=2017-09-17|website=ehsanakhgari.org|accessdate=2020-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Photon''': A [[User interface|UI]] refresh of the entire application, with a strong focus on improving UI performance. Treated as a sister project to Quantum Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dolske.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/photon-engineering-newsletter-1/|title=Photon Engineering Newsletter #1|last=dolske|date=2017-05-18|website=Dolske's blog|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was released in Firefox 57.&lt;ref name=&quot;57notes&quot;/&gt;
* '''Network''': Improve the performance of [[Mozilla application framework|Necko]], Gecko's networking layer, by moving more network activity off the main thread, context dependent prioritization of networking streams, and racing the cache layer with the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/TPE_Necko/Projects|title=TPE Necko/Projects - MozillaWiki|website=wiki.mozilla.org|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was released in Firefox 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/59.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 59 Release Notes|website=www.mozilla.org|accessdate=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Azure ==
The '''Mozilla Azure''' project is a stateless low-level graphics abstraction API used in [[Firefox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/Moz2D|title=Platform/GFX/Moz2D - MozillaWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has several objectives including more accurate Direct2D compatibility, optimized state interoperability, and improved control over performance characteristics and bugs. Azure will provide 2D hardware acceleration on top of 3D graphics backends. Firefox began using Azure instead of [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Firefox-Now-Uses-the-Azure-Graphics-API-for-Canvas-on-All-Platforms-290671.shtml|title=Firefox Now Uses the Azure Graphics API for Canvas on All Platforms|last=Parfeni|first=Lucian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTcxNQ|title=Azure Replacing Cairo In Mozilla Firefox - Phoronix}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in [[C++]] and used by [[Servo (software)|Servo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/647969/|title=Parallel page rendering with Mozilla Servo|last1=Willis|first1=Nathan|date=17 June 2015|publisher=[[LWN.net]]|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azure name is an ode to the early Netscape founder [[James H. Clark]] and his earlier work at SGI. Jim Clark invented [[Geometry Engine]] at [[Stanford University]] in 1979 which was the first GPU. [[Silicon Graphics]] were also the original inventors of [[OpenGL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/joe/2011/04/26/introducing-the-azure-project/|title=Introducing the Azure project - JOEDREW!|access-date=2019-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908220007/https://blog.mozilla.org/joe/2011/04/26/introducing-the-azure-project/|archive-date=2016-09-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

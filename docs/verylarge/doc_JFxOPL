The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] custom generally agrees with the Slavic rather than the Greek with respect to the archbishop/metropolitan distinction.

===Eastern Catholic Churches===
{{main|Eastern Catholic Churches}}
Instead of the term ''archbishop'', [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] sometimes use the word ''archeparch'' by analogy with ''eparch'', the term used for a diocesan (or eparchial) bishop. However, the word ''archeparch'' is not found in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_FA2.HTM|title=CCEO: Alphabetical: A - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''synagogue''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ə|g|ɒ|g}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|συναγωγή}}, ''{{transl|grc|synagogē}}'', 'assembly'; {{lang-he-n|בית כנסת}} ''{{transl|he|bet knesset}}'', 'house of assembly', or {{Hebrew|בית תפילה}} ''{{transl|he|bet tefila}}'', &quot;house of prayer&quot;; [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|שול}} ''shul'', [[Ladino language|Ladino]]: {{lang|lad|אשנוגה}} ''{{transl|lad|esnoga}}'', 'bright as fire'; or {{lang|lad|קהל}} ''{{transl|lad|kahal}}'') is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] (mainly) or [[Samaritanism|Samaritan]] (rarely) [[house of worship]]. Synagogues have a place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have rooms for study, a social hall, and offices. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|בית מדרש}} ''[[beth midrash]]'', lit. &quot;house of study&quot;.

Synagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, reading of the [[Tanakh]] (the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], including the [[Torah]]), study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for Jewish [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

In the [[New Testament]], the word appears 56 times, mostly in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but also in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{Bibleref2|John 9:22; 18:20}}) and the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2|Rev. 2:9; 3:9}}). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the [[Epistle of James]] ({{Bibleref2|James 2:2}}).

==Terminology==
[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' &quot;house of assembly&quot;. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''Ḳahal'', meaning &quot;community&quot;). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|pt|esnoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|es|sinagoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word ''temple''. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages]]) to cover the preceding possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples].

== Origins ==
[[File:Synagogue_de_la_Ghriba_Djerba_11.jpg|thumb|[[El Ghriba synagogue]], [[Djerba]],  Tunisia]]
Although synagogues existed a long time before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood focussed mostly on ''[[korban]]ot'' (&quot;sacrificial offerings&quot;) brought by the ''[[kohen|kohanim]]'' (&quot;priests&quot;) in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' (&quot;[[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]&quot;) as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.

According to Jewish tradition, the men of the [[Great Assembly]] (around 5th century BCE) formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=orah765768|translator-last=Ote|translator-first=Atira|title=The Institution of Prayer by the Men of the Great Assembly|date=1 February 2016|url=https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-01-05/|access-date=12 July 2020|website=Peninei Halakha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.

[[Johanan ben Zakai]], one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Synagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;pohick&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/index.html |title=Second Temple Synagogues}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} The earliest archaeological evidence for the existence of very early synagogues comes from Egypt, where stone synagogue dedication inscriptions dating from the 3rd century BCE prove that synagogues existed by that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;pohick2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald D. Binder |url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/egypt.html |title=Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2017}} More than a dozen Jewish (and possibly [[Samaritan]]) Second Temple era synagogues have been identified by archaeologists in [[Israel]] and other countries belonging to the [[Hellenistic]] world.&lt;ref name=&quot;pohick&quot;/&gt;

Any Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.

It has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]]; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period. The popularization of prayer over sacrifice during the years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiffman|first1=Lawrence|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|date=March 1991|publisher=Ktav Pub Inc|isbn=0881253723|page=159|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; had prepared the Jews for life in the diaspora, where prayer would serve as the focus of Jewish worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiffman|first1=Lawrence|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|date=March 1991|publisher=Ktav Pub Inc|isbn=0881253723|page=164|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the possibility{{dubious|Nobody seriously negates their pre-70 CE existence. Only the purpose changed.|date=July 2018}} of synagogue-like spaces prior to the First Jewish–Roman War, the synagogue emerged as a stronghold for Jewish worship upon the destruction of the Temple. For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a &quot;portable system of worship&quot;. Within the synagogue, Jews worshiped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as the main form of worship within the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schiffman |first= Lawrence |title= From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism |date= March 1991 |publisher= Ktav Pub Inc. |isbn= 0881253723 |page=164 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Temple ===
In 1995, Howard Lee Clark argued that synagogues were not a developed feature of Jewish life prior to the Roman-Jewish War of 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Howard Clark. &quot;Defining the First-Century CE Synagogue: Problems and Progress.&quot; New Testament Studies 41.4 (1995): 481-500.&lt;/ref&gt; Kee interpreted his findings as evidence that the mentions of synagogues in the New Testament, including Jesus's visitations of synagogues in various Jewish settlements in Palestine, was anacrhonistic. However, by 2018, Mordechai Aviam reported that there were now at least nine synagogues excavated known to pre-date the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in AD 70, including in Magdala, Gamla, Masada, Herdoium, Modi‘in (Kh. Umm el-‘Umdan), Qiryat Sepher (Kh. Bad ‘Issa), and Kh. Diab. Aviam concluded that he thought almost every Jewish settlement at the time, whether it was a polis or a village, had a synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Aviʿam, Mordekhai. &quot;First-Century Galilee New Discoveries.&quot; Early christianity 9.2 (2018): 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Gamla]] - a synagogue was discovered near the city gate at Gamla, a site in the Golan northeast of the Sea of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levine, Lee I.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40408825|title=The ancient synagogue : the first thousand years|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07475-1|location=New Haven|oclc=40408825}}&lt;/ref&gt; This city was destroyed by the Roman army in AD 67 and was never rebuilt.
* [[Masada]] - a synagogue was discovered on the western side of Masada, just south of the palace complex at the northern end of the site.

===Middle-Ages===
Rabbi and philosopher, [[Maimonides]] (1138–1204), described the various customs in his day with respect to local synagogues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled [with water] to lay the dust. In [[Spain]] and the [[Maghreb]], in [[Babylonia]] and in the [[Holy Land]], it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor upon which the worshippers sit. In the lands of Edom (Christendom), they sit in synagogues upon chairs [or benches].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (Hil. ''Tefillah u'birkath kohanim'' 11:4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200&quot; heights=&quot;160&quot;&gt;

==Samaritan synagogues==
[[File:Interior_of_the_Synagogue_of_the_Samaritans_Nablus_c._1920.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Samaritan synagogue in [[Nablus]] circa 1920]]

=== Name and history ===
The Samaritan house of worship is also called a synagogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, during the Hellenistic period, the Greek word used in the [[Diaspora]] by Samaritans and Jews was the same: ''proseucheμ'' (literally, a place of prayer); a later,  3rd or 4th century CE inscription, uses a similar Greek term: ''eukteμrion'' (prayer house).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; The oldest Samaritan synagogue discovered so far is from [[Delos]] in the [[Aegean Islands]], with an inscription dated between 250 and 175 BCE, while most Samaritan synagogues excavated in the wider [[Land of Israel]] and ancient [[Samaria]] in particular, were built during the 4th-7th centuries, at the very end of the Roman and throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pummer |first= Reinhard |title= How to Tell a Samaritan Synagogue from a Jewish Synagogue |journal= Biblical Archaeology Review |volume= May/June 1998 |issue= 24:03 |via= Center for Online Judaic Studies, cojs.org |url= http://cojs.org/how_to_tell_a_samaritan_synagogue_from_a_jewish_synagogue-_reinhard_pummer-_bar_24-03-_may-jun_1998/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinguishing elements===
The elements which distinguish Samaritan synagogues from contemporary Jewish ones are:
* '''Alphabet''': the use of the [[Samaritan script]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* '''Orthography'''. When the Samaritan script is used, there are some Hebrew words which would be spelled in a way typical only for the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], for instance &quot;forever&quot; is written 'lmw instead of l'lm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; When Greek is the language used in inscriptions, typically, Samaritans may contract two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words into one, such ''har'' (mountain) and Gerizim becoming, in Greek, ''Argarizein''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* '''Orientation''': the façade, or entrance of the Samaritan synagogue, is typically facing towards [[Mount Gerizim]], which is the most holy site to Samaritans, while Jewish synagogues would be oriented towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* '''Decoration''': the mosaic floor and other architectural elements or artifacts are sometimes decorated with typical symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; As the Samaritans have historically adhered more strictly to the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|commandment forbidding the creation of any &quot;graven image&quot;]], they would not use any depictions of man or beast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; Representations of the signs of the zodiac, of human figures or even Greek deities such as the god [[Helios]], as seen in Byzantine-period Jewish synagogues, would be unimaginable in Samaritan buildings of any period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

:A representation of Mount Gerizim is a clear indication of Samaritan identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, although the existence of a Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim is both mentioned by Josephus and confirmed by archaeological excavation at its summit, the temple's early destruction in the 2nd century BCE led to its memory disappearing from Samaritan tradition, so that no temple-related items would be found in Samaritan synagogue depictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; Religious implements, such as are also known from ancient Jewish synagogue mosaics ([[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], [[shofar]], [[shewbread]] table, [[trumpet]]s, incense shovels, and specifically the façade of what looks like a temple or a Torah shrine) are also present in Samaritan ones, but the objects are always related to the desert [[Tabernacle]], the [[Ark of the Covenant]] within the Tabernacle, or the [[Synagogue#Torah Ark|Torah shrine]] in the synagogue itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; Samaritans believe that at the end of time the Tabernacle and its utensils will be recovered from the place they were buried on Mount Gerizim and as such play an important role in Samaritan beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt; Since the same artists, such as mosaicists, worked for all ethno-religious communities of the time, some depictions might be identical in Samaritan and Jewish synagogues, Christian churches and pagan temples, but their significance would differ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

:Missing from Samaritan synagogue floors would be images often found in Jewish ones: the [[lulav]] (palm-branch) and [[etrog]] (lemon-like fruit) have a different ritual use by Samaritans celebrating [[Sukkot]], and do not appear on mosaic floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

* '''Ritual baths near the synagogue after 70 CE''': Jews abandoned the habit of building [[Mikveh|mikva'ot]] next to their houses of worship after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|70 CE destruction]] of the [[Jerusalem Temple]], but Samaritans continued with the practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

===Archaeological finds===
Ancient Samaritan synagogues are mentioned by literary sources or have been found by archaeologists in the Diaspora, in the wider Holy Land, and specifically in Samaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

====Diaspora====
* Delos: a Samaritan inscription has been dated to between 250 and 175 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* [[Rome]] and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]: ancient literature offers hints that Samaritan synagogues may have existed in these cities between the fourth and sixth centuries CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]: short inscriptions found there and using the Samaritan and Greek alphabet may originate from Samaritan synagogues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

====The wider Holy Land====
* [[Sha'alvim]] synagogue, discovered in Judea, northwest of Jerusalem. Probably built in the 4th or 5th century CE and destroyed in the 5th or 6th.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* [[Tell Qasile]] synagogue, built at the beginning of the 7th century CE&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* [[Beth Shean]], &quot;Synagogue A&quot;. A room added to an existing building in the late 6th or early 7th century CE served as a Samaritan synagogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

====Samaria====
* El-Khirbe synagogue, discovered c. 3&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]], was built in the 4th century CE and remained in use into the Early Islamic period, with a break during the late 5th–early 6th century&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* Khirbet Samara synagogue, c. 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Nablus]] and built in the 4th century CE&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;
* Zur Natan synagogue, c. 29&amp;nbsp;km west of Nablus and built in the 5th century CE&lt;ref name=&quot;Pummer&quot;/&gt;

==Jewish–Christian synagogue-churches==
During the first Christian centuries, [[Jewish Christian|Jewish–Christians]] used houses of worship known in academic literature as [[synagogue-church]]es.

==Architectural design==
[[File:Exterior of kaifeng synagogue.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the synagogue of the [[Kaifeng Jews|Kaifeng Jewish community]] in China.]]
{{Main|Synagogue architecture}}
There is no set [[blueprint]] for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.

Historically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mudéjar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.

With the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.

In the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.&lt;gallery&gt;

==Interior elements==
===Bimah (platform)===
All synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a large, raised, reader's platform (called {{lang|he-Latn|teḇah}} (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read. In Sephardi synagogues it is also used as the prayer leader's reading desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bimah|title=Encyclopedia Judaica: The Bimah|website=JewishVirtualLibrary.org|access-date=2019-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths=&quot;200&quot; heights=&quot;200&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table or lectern===
In Ashkenazi synagogues, the [[Torah]] was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the [[hazzan]], stood at his own lectern or table, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/365934/jewish/The-Bimah-The-Synagogue-Platform.htm|title=The Bimah: The Synagogue Platform|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/synagogue-background-and-overview|title=Synagogue Background &amp; Overview|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2019-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torah Ark===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The [[Torah Ark]], called in Hebrew {{Hebrew|ארון קודש}} ''Aron Kodesh'' or 'holy chest', and alternatively called the ''heikhal''—{{Hebrew|היכל}} or 'temple' by [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jews]], is a cabinet in which the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept.

The ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards [[Jerusalem]]. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.

The Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]]. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the {{lang|he-Latn|[[parochet]]}} {{Hebrew|פרוכת}}, which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.

===Eternal Light===

Other traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the {{lang|he-Latn|[[ner tamid]]}} ({{Hebrew|נר תמיד}}), the &quot;Eternal Light&quot;, used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/365933/jewish/Ner-Tamid-The-Eternal-Light.htm &quot;Ner Tamid: The Eternal Light.&quot;] ''Chabad''.  28 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner decoration===
A synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Seating===
Originally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in [[Spain]], the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa), [[Babylonia]], the [[Land of Israel]] and [[Yemen]] having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Tefillah'' 11:4), who wrote: &quot;Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled to lay the dust. In Spain and in the Maghreb (North Africa), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor on which the worshipers sit. In the land of Edom (i.e. Christian countries) they sit in synagogues upon chairs.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Until the 19th century, in an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] synagogue, all seats most often faced the Torah Ark. In a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] synagogue, seats were usually arranged around the perimeter of the sanctuary, but when the worshipers stood up to pray, everyone faced the Ark.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Special seats===
Many current synagogues have an elaborate chair named for the prophet [[Elijah]], which is only sat upon during the ceremony of [[Brit milah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaklikowski |first1=David |title=The Chair of Elijah and Welcoming the Baby |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144123/jewish/The-Chair-of-Elijah-and-Welcoming-the-Baby.htm#footnote5a144123 |publisher=Chabad |access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient synagogues, a special chair placed on the wall facing Jerusalem and next to the Torah Shrine was reserved for the prominent members of the congregation and for important guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moses&quot;&gt;The Interactive Bible, [http://www.bible.ca/synagogues/Moses-Seat-Metaphor-Pride-reader-leader-judge-Architectural-ancient-Synagogue-pre-70AD-standardized-typology-design-incorporated-adopted-similarities-into-church.htm  ''Synagogue Moses' Seat: Metaphor of Pride'']&lt;/ref&gt; Such a stone-carved and inscribed seat was discovered at archaeological excavations in the synagogue at [[Chorazin]] in [[Galilee]] and dates from the 4th–6th century;&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Museum]], [http://museum.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewItemE.asp?case=6&amp;itemNum=536019 Elaborate seat, Chorazin synagogue]&lt;/ref&gt; another one was discovered at the [[Delos Synagogue]], complete with a footstool.

[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]&quot; ''Dark Horse Comics'' (&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1&quot; released September 23, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off—taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew-firstlook&quot;/&gt; The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called &quot;[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]&quot; which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also after &quot;[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]&quot; came other story arcs like Faith's return in &quot;[[No Future for You]]&quot; and a ''Fray'' cross-over in &quot;[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]&quot;. Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom! Studio's approach to rebooting ''Buffy'' has been stylistically compared to the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series by the creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/2019/01/23/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-interview-jordie-bellaire-jeanine-schaefer/ |title=interview with Jordie Bellaire and Jeanie Schaefer |publisher=ComicBook.com |first=Jamie |last=Lovett |date=January 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joss Whedon is not as involved in the rebooted ''Buffy'' comic as he was in Dark Horse's continuation, however he did take part in the initial development stages for the series and gave his blessing to the creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/23/why-boom-studios-decided-to-reboot-buffy-the-vampire-slayer |title=Why Boom!

[[Pocket Books]] hold the license to produce [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|''Buffy'' novels]], of which they have published more than sixty since 1998.

The most recent novels include ''[[Carnival of Souls (Buffy novel)|Carnival of Souls]]'', ''[[Blackout (Buffy novel)|Blackout]]'', ''[[Portal Through Time]]'', ''[[Bad Bargain]]'', and ''The Deathless''.

===Undeveloped spinoffs===
{{main|Undeveloped Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoffs}}

The popularity of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional 'Buffyverse'. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': &quot;We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff – and nobody wanted it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon |author=Hockensmith, Steve |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.&lt;ref&gt;Espenson, Jane, &quot;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]&quot;, ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) &amp; &quot;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]&quot;, ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''. Titan Magazines, Issue 80, (December 2005), p19.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little heard about the series until 2007 when Joss Whedon confirmed that talks were almost completed for a 90-minute ''Ripper'' special on the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/07/28/comic-con-joss-whedon-panel-report/ |title=Comic-Con: Joss Whedon panel report |publisher=Tvsquad.com |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both Head and the BBC completely on board.

In 2003, a year after the first public discussions on ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' and ''Ripper'', ''Buffy'' was nearing its end. Espenson has said that during this time spinoffs were discussed, &quot;I think [[Marti Noxon|Marti]] talked with Joss about ''[[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Slayer School|Slayer School]]'' and [[Tim Minear]] talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/07/03/5522.shtml |title=Dear Jane |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030708105652/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/07/03/5522.shtml |archivedate=July 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Espenson has revealed that ''Slayer School'' might have used new slayers and potentially included [[Willow Rosenberg]], but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/14787 |title=Way Interesting Buffy Bits (Courtesy Jane E &amp; Others |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |date=March 21, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/03/24/3421.shtml |title=Spin-offs stop spinning |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=March 24, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405030949/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/03/24/3421.shtml |archivedate=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Faith the Vampire Slayer|TV series based on Faith]] and instead agreed to a deal to produce ''[[Tru Calling]]''. Dushku explained to [[IGN]]: &quot;It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I would not have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following ''Buffy'', I think that those would have been really big boots to fill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kuhn, Sarah |url=https://ign.com/articles/2003/05/28/an-interview-with-eliza-dushku?page=2 |title=An Interview with Eliza Dushku |website=IGN |date=May 28, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: &quot;The show was basically going to be Faith meets ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/04/14/3812.shtml |title=Kung Fu Faith |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314055320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/04/14/3812.shtml |archivedate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of ''Angel'', a movie about [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whedonesque.com/comments/3877 Spike TV movie on the cards?], ''Whedonesque.com'' (May 9, 2004). Marsters is indirectly quoted about the possibility of a Spike movie in May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and [[Amy Acker]] and featured Alyson Hannigan.&lt;ref&gt;Saney, Daniel, &quot;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a24796/whedon-eyes-willow-for-spike-movie.html Whedon eyes Willow for Spike movie]&quot;, ''Digitalspy.co.uk'' (September 28, 2005). Originally reported by ''Tvguide.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the 2006 [[Saturn Award]]s, Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://whedonesque.com/comments/10310 Video interview with Joss from the Saturn Awards]&quot;, ''Whedonesque.com'' (February 15, 2006). Originally reported by ''Iesb.net''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, ''Sci-Fi Wire'' ran an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which she said she would not rule out returning to her most iconic role: &quot;Never say never&quot;, she said. &quot;One of the reasons the original ''Buffy'' movie did not really work on the big screen–and people blamed Kristy, but that's not what it was–the story was better told over a long arc&quot;, Gellar said. &quot;And I worry about Buffy as a 'beginning, middle and end' so quickly. ... You show me a script; you show me that it works, and you show me that [the] audience can accept that, [and] I'd probably be there. Those are what my hesitations are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whedon.info/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-New-Buffy.html |title=Sarah Michelle Gellar - New &quot;Buffy&quot; Movie - A Film Wouldn't Work |publisher=Sci-Fi Wire |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buffy'' is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture, as a subset of [[popular culture studies]], and some academic settings include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529/ |title=Scholars lecture on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' |publisher=CTV News |date=May 29, 2004 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604122828/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529/ |archivedate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2006/05/16/study-buffy-at-university-79726/ |title=Study Buffy at university |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Public Radio]] describes ''Buffy'' as having a &quot;special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3850482 [[Neda Ulaby|Ulaby, Neda]]], '[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1262180 – 'Buffy Studies']&quot;, ''National Public Radio'' (May 13, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term &quot;Buffy studies&quot; is commonly used amongst the peer-reviewed academic ''Buffy''-related writings.&lt;ref&gt;Lavery, David, &amp; Wilcox, Rhonda V., [http://slayageonline.com/ ''Slayageonline.com''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908103612/http://slayageonline.com/ |date=September 8, 2009 }} (2001–). The term is in use from the subtitle of ''Slayage: The Online International Journal of Buffy Studies'', and has thus become used in essays by those who contribute to scholarship relating to ''Buffy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ''Buffy'' on the depiction of vampires across popular culture has also been noted by anthropologists such as A.

Critics have emerged in response to the academic attention the series has received. For example, Jes Battis, who authored ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel|Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel]]'', admits that study of the Buffyverse &quot;invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire&quot; and meets &quot;a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Battis, Jes, [[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel|''Blood Relations'']], ''McFarland &amp; Company'' (June 2005), page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, ''Buffy'' eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including [[sociology]], [[Speech Communication]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[women's studies]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

===''Buffy'' in popular culture===
{{main|Buffy the Vampire Slayer in popular culture}}
The series, which employed [[popular culture|pop culture]] references as a frequent humorous device, has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows. The series has also been parodied and spoofed. Sarah Michelle Gellar has participated in several parody sketches, including a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' universe,&lt;ref&gt;[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]] (aired January 17, 1998) see 'doggans' (transcriber) [http://snltranscripts.jt.org/97/97kbuffy.phtml SNL Transcripts: &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;], ''Snltranscripts.jt.org'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and adding her voice to an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' that parodied a would-be eighth season of ''Buffy''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Buffy Season 8&quot; from ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' Season 1, episode 4 (aired March 13, 2005).

''Buffy'' helped put [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] on the ratings map, but by the time the series landed on [[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale &quot;[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]&quot; pulled in a season high of 4.9 million viewers on the UPN network.&lt;ref name=&quot;s7 ratings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode &quot;[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]&quot;, which was watched by 8.2 million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00 pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00 pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.

In the 2001–2002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it. The relaunching had an effect, as the season premiere attracted the second highest rating of the series, with 7.7 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/top-ten-genre-broadcast-tv-ratings-oct-17_article_30089.html |title=Top Ten Genre Broadcast TV ratings (Oct. 1-7) |publisher=Mania.com |date=October 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |author=Kurtz, Frank |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018135406/http://www.mania.com/top-ten-genre-broadcast-tv-ratings-oct-17_article_30089.html |archivedate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on television===
Commentators of the entertainment industry including ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[PopMatters]]'', ''[[Allmovie]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have cited ''Buffy'' as &quot;influential&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; some citing it as the ascent of [[Golden Age of Television (2000s–present)|television into its golden age]].&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, Brian J., &quot;[https://www.allmovie.com/work/174873 &lt;nowiki&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer [TV Series]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&quot;, ''Allmovie'' (2003 or after): &quot;wildly influential cult hit&quot;.

{{Quote box|width =30%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=&quot;''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' showed the whole world, and an entire sprawling industry, that writing monsters and demons and end-of-the world is not hack-work, it can challenge the best.

Its effect on programming was quickly evident. Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U.S. that featured strong females who are forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salem&quot;&gt;Salem, Rob, &quot;[http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1319&amp;img= The season to talk to dead people]&quot;, ''Thestar.com'', transcribed to ''Whedon.info'' (August 25, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; These post-''Buffy'' shows include ''[[Dead Like Me]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Tru Calling]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' and ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]''. [[Bryan Fuller]], the creator of ''Dead Like Me'', said that &quot;''Buffy'' showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable, and instead of shunting women off to the side, it puts them at the center.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salem&quot; /&gt; In the United Kingdom, the lessons learned from the impact of ''Buffy'' influenced the revived ''[[Doctor Who]]'' series (2005–present),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/doctor-who-report-new-theme-music |title=Doctor Who Report: New Theme Music? |website=IGN |date=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its spinoff series ''[[Torchwood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stokes |author2=Hugo, Simon |date=March 2008 |title=Like a Kid in a Candy Store |journal=[[Torchwood Magazine]] |issue=2 |pages=64–65 |issn=1756-0950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ''Buffy'' alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows. Such endeavors include ''[[Tru Calling]]'' ([[Douglas Petrie]], [[Jane Espenson]] and lead actress [[Eliza Dushku]]), ''[[Wonderfalls]]'' ([[Tim Minear]]), ''[[Point Pleasant (TV series)|Point Pleasant]]'' ([[Marti Noxon]]), ''[[Jake 2.0]]'' ([[David Greenwalt]]), ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' (Tim Minear), ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' ([[Steven S. DeKnight]]), ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' ([[Jane Espenson]]), and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' ([[Drew Goddard]] and [[David Fury]]).

Meanwhile, the [[Parents Television Council]] complained of efforts to &quot;deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp The 2001–2002 Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Network TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609011639/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp |date=June 9, 2007 }}&quot; &amp; &quot;[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/stateindustryviolence/main.asp TV Bloodbath: Violence on Prime Time Broadcast TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013153502/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/stateindustryviolence/main.asp |date=October 13, 2006 }}&quot; ''Parentstv.org'' (2002 &amp; 2003 respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), however, rejected the Council's indecency complaint concerning the violent sex scene between Buffy and Spike in &quot;[[Smashed (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Smashed]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2004/FCC-04-196A1.html FCC, In the Matter of Complaints Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the UPN Network Program &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; on November 20, 2001].&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC, however, chose to censor some of the more controversial sexual content when it was shown on the pre-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]] 6:45 pm slot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage8/Burr.htm Burr, Vivien. &quot;Buffy vs. the BBC: Moral Questions and How to Avoid Them&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234420/http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage8/Burr.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the show showed girlfriends Willow Rosenberg and Tara Maclay in bed together, which though not a sex scene was considered the first scene of its kind for a broadcast network series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Maya |last=Salam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/arts/television/lesbian-tv-shows.html |title=The Very (Very) Slow Rise of Lesbianism on TV |work=The New York Times |date=November 29, 2019 |accessdate=December 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the show featured the first lesbian sex scene in broadcast TV history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost |first=Karen |url=https://www.afterellen.com/tv/474467-long-road-lesbian-sex-sensuality-network-tv#UjXTCyxhuYzGUkMG.99 |title=The Long Road to Lesbian Sex &amp; Sensuality on Network TV |publisher=AfterEllen |date=August 19, 2017 |accessdate=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series won the Drama Category for Television's Most Memorable Moment at the [[60th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for &quot;[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]&quot; beating ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Brian's Song]]'' and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', although the sequence for this award was not aired.

It was nominated for [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] awards, winning a total of three Emmys. However, snubs in lead Emmy categories resulted in outrage among TV critics and the decision by the academy to hold a tribute event in honor of the series after it had gone off the air in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribute&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/true-blood-anna-paquin-vampires-emmy-nominations-news.html |title='True Blood' breaks the Emmy vampire curse |first=Tom |last=O'Neil |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=latimes.com |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo foot|'''''Zero Wing'''''|ゼロウィング|''Zero Wingu''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[Shoot 'em up#Types|horizontally scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] developed by [[Toaplan]] and originally published in Japan by [[Namco]] and in North America by [[Williams Electronics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ATVGL:JaO1971-2005&quot;/&gt; Controlling the ZIG space fighter craft, players assume the role of protagonist Trent in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien cyborg CATS. It was the eighth shoot 'em up game from Toaplan, and their fourteenth video game overall.

Headed by development chief Toshiaki Ōta, ''Zero Wing'' was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan, initially starting as a project not intended for commercial release to train new recruits before being ultimately released to the market. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]], each one featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version.

''Zero Wing'' enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and its home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s were met with mostly positive reception from critics. The European [[Sega Mega Drive]] version later gained renewed popularity due to the &quot;[[All your base are belong to us]]&quot; [[internet meme]], which plays off the poorly translated introductory [[cutscene]] in [[Engrish]]. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:ARC Zero Wing.png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]
''Zero Wing'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to ''[[Hellfire (video game)|Hellfire]]'', where players assume the role of Trent taking control of the ZIG space fighter craft through eight increasingly difficult levels, each with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end that must be fought before progressing any further, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien cyborg CATS as the main objective.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWJPacflyer&quot;&gt;''Zero Wing'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWSMDmanual&quot;&gt;''Zero Wing'' instruction manual (Sega Mega Drive, EU)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWPCECDROMm&quot;&gt;''Zero Wing'' manual (PC Engine CD-ROM², JP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWhg101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Zverloff|first=Nick|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/zero-wing/|title=Zero Wing|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=12 December 2009|access-date=2020-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/zerowing.html|title=ZERO WING|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-05-20|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as horizontal scrolling shooters go, the title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until the stage boss is reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWSMDmanual&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZWhg101&quot;/&gt;

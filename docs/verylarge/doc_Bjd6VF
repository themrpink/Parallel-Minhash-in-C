Despite having a few successful shows like the science fiction drama ''[[The X-Files]]'', Fox still lacked credibility among viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcs20190206&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article225279155.html |title=Kansas City Chiefs' tax returns provide rare look inside the business of pro football |last1=Hendricks |first1=Mike |date=2019-02-06 |work=The Kansas City Star |access-date=2019-02-10 |last2=Vockrodt |first2=Steve |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those working in television thought of the network as &quot;the one that has that cartoon show&quot; (''The Simpsons''). More than 85% of affiliates in 1993 were UHF stations. Fox became a viable competitor to the older networks when it won broadcast television rights to the [[National Football League]] away from [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]. In December 1993, Fox signed a contract with the NFL to televise games from the [[National Football Conference]]—which had been airing its games on CBS since [[1956 NFL season|1956]]—starting with the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]].

Shortly afterward, News Corporation began striking affiliation deals with, and later purchasing, more television station groups. On May 23, 1994, Fox agreed to purchase a 20% stake in [[New World Pictures#New World Communications|New World Communications]], a television and film [[production company]] controlled by investor [[Ronald Perelman]] that had just recently entered into broadcasting through its 1993 purchase of seven stations owned by [[Storer Broadcasting|SCI Television]]. As a result of Fox acquiring a 20% minority interest in the company, New World signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of twelve stations (eight CBS affiliates, three ABC affiliates [ [[WBRC|two]] [[WGHP|of which]] were subsequently placed in a [[blind trust]] and then sold directly to Fox due to conflicts with FCC ownership rules], and [[WDAF-TV|one NBC affiliate]]) that it had either already owned outright or was in the process of acquiring from [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]] and [[Hearst Television|Argyle Communications]] at the time to Fox starting in September 1994 and continuing as existing affiliation contracts with their existing major network partners expired.&lt;ref name=nytbusinessdigest&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Will Sign Up 12 New Stations; Takes 8 from CBS|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/fox-will-sign-up-12-new-stations-takes-8-from-cbs.html?pagewanted=4 |author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 24, 1994|accessdate=October 22, 2012|author-link = Bill Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fox and the New World order |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-05-30.pdf |first=Geoffrey|last= Foisie |journal=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]] |pages=6, 8 |date=May 30, 1994 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The FCC last week approved New World's plans to transfer WGHP-TV Greensboro, N.C., and WBRC-TV Birmingham, Ala., into a trust for eventual sale to Fox|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073449/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16799904.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 16, 2015|author=Kim McAvoy|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=April 10, 1995|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, [[SF Broadcasting]], a [[joint venture]] between Fox and [[Savoy Pictures]] that was founded in March 1994, purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting ([[KHON-TV|three]] [[WALA-TV|NBC]] [[WLUK-TV|affiliates]] and [[WVUE-DT|one ABC affiliate]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; Fox Adds 3 Network-Affiliated Stations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/27/business/company-news-fox-adds-3-network-affiliated-stations.html|author=Andy Meisler|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Savoy partners to buy Fox affils|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/savoy-partners-to-buy-fox-affils-119324/|author=Jim Benson|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=March 17, 1994|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through a separate agreement, those stations would also switch to Fox between September 1995 and January 1996 as existing affiliation agreements lapsed. These two deals were not the first instances in which a longtime &quot;Big Three&quot; station affiliated with Fox: the network scored its first major coup when it moved its [[Miami]] affiliation from charter affiliate WCIX (which became a CBS owned-and-operated station, now [[WFOR-TV]]) to NBC affiliate [[WSVN]] in January 1989, the result of a three-station affiliation swap spurred by NBC's purchase of longtime CBS affiliate [[WTVJ]]. Through the expansion of its news programming and a refocused emphasis on crime stories and sensationalistic reporting under [[news director]] [[Joel Cheatwood]], that switch helped the perennial third-place WSVN become a strong competitor in the Miami market.

The NFC contract, in fact, was the impetus for the affiliation deal with New World&lt;ref name=nytbusinessdigest/&gt; and SF Broadcasting's purchase of the Burnham stations, as Fox sought to improve local coverage of its new NFL package by aligning the network with stations that had more established histories and advertiser value than its charter affiliates. The deals spurred a series of affiliation realignments between all four U.S. television networks involving individual stations and various broadcasting groups such as those between CBS and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] (whose [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|corporate parent]] later bought the network in August 1995), and ABC and the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] (which owned [[KNXV-TV|three]] [[KSHB-TV|Fox]] [[WFTS-TV|affiliates]] that switched to either ABC or NBC as a result of the New World deal) affecting 30 television markets between September 1994 and September 1996. The two deals also had the side benefit of increasing local news programming on the new Fox affiliates, mirroring the programming format adopted by WSVN upon that station's switch to the network (as well as expanding the number of news-producing stations in Fox's portfolio beyond mainly charter stations in certain large and mid-sized markets).

With significant market share for the first time ever and the rights to the NFL, Fox firmly established itself as the nation's fourth major network. Fox Television Stations would acquire New World outright on July 17, 1996 in a $2.48&amp;nbsp;billion stock purchase, making the latter's twelve Fox affiliates owned-and-operated stations of the network;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New World Vision : Murdoch's News Corp. to Buy Broadcast Group|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-18/business/fi-25271_1_rupert-murdoch-s-news-corp|author=Brian Lowry|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 18, 1996|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Murdoch's News Corp.

Later, in August 2000, Fox bought several stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries and its subsidiaries [[BHC Communications]] and United Television for $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion (most of these stations were UPN affiliates, although its Minneapolis station KMSP-TV would rejoin Fox in September 2002 as an owned-and-operated station).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These purchases, for a time, made Fox Television Stations the largest owner of television stations in the U.S. (a title that has since been assumed by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], one of the network's largest affiliate groups).

====Evolving programming====
Fox completed its prime time expansion to all seven nights on January 19, [[1992–93 United States network television schedule|1993]], with the launch of two additional nights of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (The method of gradually adding nights to the programming schedule that began with the network's April 1987 prime time launch was replicated by The WB and UPN when those networks debuted in January 1995). September 1993 saw the heavy promotion and debut of a short-lived [[western (genre)|western]] series that incorporated science-fiction elements, ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]'' However, it was the supernatural investigative drama that debuted immediately following it on Friday nights, ''[[The X-Files]]'', that would find long-lasting success, and would become Fox's first series to crack Nielsen's year-end Top 20 most-watched network programs. After several other failed attempts at late night programming following the cancellation of ''The Late Show'' (most notably, the quick failure of ''[[The Chevy Chase Show]]'' in 1993), Fox finally found success in that time period with the debut of ''[[MADtv]]'' on October 14, 1995; the sketch comedy series became a solid competitor to NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for over a decade and was the network's most successful late night program as well as one of its most successful Saturday night shows, running for 14 seasons until 2009.

An attempt to make a larger effort to program Saturday nights by moving ''Married... with Children'' from its longtime Sunday slot and adding a new but short-lived sitcom (''[[Love and Marriage (1996 TV series)|Love and Marriage]]'') to the night at the beginning of the [[1996–97 United States network television schedule|1996–97 season]] backfired with the public, as it resulted in a brief cancellation of ''America's Most Wanted'' that was criticized by law enforcement and public officials, and was roundly rejected by viewers, which brought swift cancellation to the newer series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Day 'Most Wanted' was canceled|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/day_most_wanted_was_canceled_yq6gF5snMkKkT48hBp41jO|author=Maxine Shen|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=March 5, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Married...'' quickly returned to Sundays (before moving again to Mondays two months later); both it and ''Martin'' would end their runs at the end of that season. The Saturday schedule was revised in November 1996, to feature one new and one encore episode of ''Cops'', and the revived ''America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back''. ''Cops'' and ''AMW'' remained the anchors of Fox's Saturday lineup, making it the most stable night in American broadcast television for over 14 years; both shows eventually were among the few first-run programs remaining on Saturday evenings across the four major networks after decreasing prime time viewership – as more people opted to engage in leisure activities away from home rather than watch television on that night of the week led ABC, NBC and CBS to largely abandon first-run series on Saturdays (outside [[newsmagazine]]s, sports and [[burning off|burned off]] prime time shows that failed on other nights) in favor of reruns and movies by the mid-2000s. ''America's Most Wanted'' ended its 22-year run on Fox in June 2011, and was subsequently picked up by [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] (before being cancelled for good in 2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dramatic Re-Enactment: Transcript |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/jun/03/dramatic-re-enactment/transcript/ |author=Bob Garfield |website=On The Media |publisher=[[WNYC]]/New York Public Radio |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406080341/http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/jun/03/dramatic-re-enactment/transcript/ |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cops'', in turn, would move its first-run episodes to [[Paramount Network|Spike]] in 2013 after 23 seasons (ending its original run on Fox as the network's longest-running prime time program) and would be cancelled in 2020, leaving sports and repeats of reality and drama series as the only programs airing on Fox on Saturday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Cops' moving from Fox to Spike TV|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-06/lifestyle/39061971_1_median-age-cops-spike|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=May 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510204140/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-06/lifestyle/39061971_1_median-age-cops-spike|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1997–98 United States network television schedule|1997–98 season]], Fox had three shows in the Nielsen Top 20 (in terms of total viewers), ''The X-Files'' (which ranked 11th), ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (which ranked 15th) and ''The Simpsons'' (which ranked 18th). Building around its flagship animated comedy ''The Simpsons'', Fox would experience relative success with animated series in prime time, beginning with the debut of the [[Mike Judge]]-produced ''King of the Hill'' in 1997. ''[[Family Guy]]'' (the first of three [[adult animation|adult-oriented animated series]] from [[Seth MacFarlane]] to air on the network) and ''[[Futurama]]'' (from ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]) would make their debuts in 1999, however, they were canceled in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Due to strong DVD sales and highly rated cable reruns on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]], Fox later decided to order new episodes of ''Family Guy'', which began airing in 2005. ''Futurama'' would be revived with four direct-to-DVD films between 2007 and 2009 and would return as a first-run series on [[Comedy Central]], where it ran from 2010 to 2013. Less successful efforts included ''[[The Critic]]'', starring ''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus [[Jon Lovitz]] (which Fox picked up in 1994 after it was cancelled by ABC, only for the series to be cancelled again after its second season), and ''[[The PJs]]'' (which moved to The WB in 2000, after Fox cancelled that series after its second season). Other notable shows that debuted in the late 1990s included the quirky [[David E. Kelley]]-produced live-action [[Comedy-drama|dramedy]] ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', the short-lived game show ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', and the period comedy ''[[That '70s Show]]'', the latter of which became Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom, airing for eight seasons.

Throughout the 1990s and into the next decade, Fox launched a slate of cable channels beginning with the 1994 debuts of general entertainment network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and movie channel FXM: Movies from Fox (now [[FX Movie Channel]]), followed by the debut of [[Fox News Channel]] in August 1996. Its sports operations expanded with the acquisition of controlling interests in several [[regional sports network]]s (including the [[Prime Network]] and [[SportsChannel]]) between 1996 and 2000 to form [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] (which launched in November 1996), its 2000 purchase of Speedvision (later Speed Channel, which was replaced in the United States by [[Fox Sports 1]] in August 2013, however, it continues to exist in other North American and [[The Caribbean|Caribbean]] countries as [[Fox Sports Racing]]), and the launches of Fox Sports World (later [[Fox Soccer]], which was replaced by [[FXX]] in September 2013) and Fox Sports en Español (now [[Fox Deportes]]) in the early 2000s.

===2000s: Rise to ratings leadership, the ''American Idol'' effect, and fierce rivalry with CBS===
By 2000, many staple Fox shows of the 1990s had ended their runs. During the late 1990s and carrying over into the early 2000s, Fox put much of its efforts into producing [[reality television|reality]] shows many of which were considered to be sensationalistic and controversial in nature – such as ''[[Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'', ''[[Married by America]]'', and ''[[Joe Millionaire]]'' (which became the first Fox program ever to crack the Nielsen Top 10), as well as video clip shows such as ''[[World's Wildest Police Videos]]'' and ''[[When Animals Attack!]]''. After shedding most of these programs, Fox gradually filled its lineup with acclaimed dramas such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', and ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', and comedies such as ''[[The Bernie Mac Show]]'', ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''.

As the decade wore on, Fox began surpassing ABC and NBC in the ratings, first in age demographics, then in overall viewership, and placed second behind a resurgent CBS in total viewership, beginning in [[2001–02 United States network television schedule|2002]]. Fox hit a major milestone in [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2005]] when it emerged as the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the lucrative 18–49 demographic for the first time, largely boosted by the strength of the reality singing competition series ''[[American Idol]]''. Regarded as the single most dominant program on 21st-century U.S. television, as well as the first Fox show to lead the Nielsen seasonal ratings, ''Idol'' had peak audiences of up to 38&amp;nbsp;million viewers during the [[American Idol season 2|2003 season finale]] and double-season average audiences of around 31&amp;nbsp;million viewers in [[American Idol (season 5)|2006]] and [[American Idol (season 6)|2007]]. Subsequently, it leapfrogged over Fox's Big Three competition to become the highest-rated U.S. television program overall starting with the [[American Idol (season 3)|2003–04 season]], becoming the first reality singing competition series in the country ever to reach first place in the seasonal ratings.

''Idol'' remains the most recent U.S. television program to date to lead the national prime time ratings and attract at least 30&amp;nbsp;million viewers for at least two television seasons. It is the most watched program on U.S. television by seasonal average viewership in the 2000s decade, as well as the most recent program scheduled to have successfully established a [[graveyard slot]] on U.S. television since the end of NBC's ''[[Friends]]'' in 2004 and the subsequent decline of the network's previously dominant &quot;[[Must See TV]]&quot; Thursday timeblock. By 2005, reality television succeeded sitcoms as the most popular form of entertainment in the U.S. as a result of Fox's rise with ''Idol'' and NBC's network declines. ''House'', which aired as ''Idol'''s lead-out program on Tuesday nights, earned international prominence in the 21st century and became Fox's first prime time drama series (and the network's third program overall) to reach the Nielsen Top 10 beginning [[2005–06 United States network television schedule|2006]].

Beginning [[2003–04 United States network television schedule|2004]], CBS and Fox, which ranked as the two most-watched broadcast networks in the U.S. during the 2000s, have tended to equal one another in [[Demographics|demographic ratings]] among general viewership, with both networks winning certain demographics by narrow margins; however, while Fox has the youngest-skewing viewer base, CBS is consistently regarded to have the oldest audience demographics among the major broadcast networks. Fox hit a milestone in February 2005 by scoring its first-ever [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]] victory in total viewership and demographic ratings, boosted largely by its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] and the strengths of ''American Idol'', ''24'', ''House'', and ''The O.C''.

In September 2006, as a result of the increasing number of over-the-air Fox affiliates and the increased availability of digital subchannels carrying Fox in certain markets, Foxnet was discontinued. Then, a sweeping milestone came by the conclusion of the [[2007–08 United States network television schedule|2007–08 season]] on May 21, 2008, shortly after the widely acclaimed [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh-season finale]] of ''American Idol'', when Fox outranked longtime leader CBS as the most watched television network overall in the United States, attributed to the strengths of [[Super Bowl XLII]] and its NFL game coverages, ''Idol'' and ''House'' during that season. To date, Fox is the only non-Big Three network to top the overall Nielsen ratings since its inception in the [[1950-1951 United States network television schedule|1950–51 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo&quot;/&gt;

In the late 2000s, Fox launched a few series that proved to be powerful hits in different respects. In 2007, the network began production on the game shows ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' and ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics]]''; both shows ran for a total of three seasons each, making them the longest-running game shows in Fox's history. In 2008, the supernatural mystery series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' debuted to moderate ratings but earned critical acclaim during its first season on Tuesdays. Throughout its run, the series developed a large loyal fanbase that turned the show into a cult favorite. In 2009, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' premiered to average ratings when its pilot aired as a lead-out program of the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth-season finale]] of ''American Idol'', but earned positive reviews from critics. The cast of the series has been acknowledged by notable luminaries such as the [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]], who have each asked the cast to perform live for various national events.

===2010–2017: Network's ratings collapse and revamp in network programming===
At the dawn of the 2010s, new comedies ''[[Raising Hope]]'' and ''[[New Girl]]'' gave Fox its first live-action comedy successes in years. The [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of ''Glee'' delivered that series' highest ratings during the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–11]] season, with viewership peaking during its [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|Super Bowl lead-out]] [[The Sue Sylvester Shuffle|episode]] in February 2011 (marking the most expensive post-Super Bowl episode ever produced on U.S. television). The said show has continuously attracted worldwide media attention that it formed a large, loyal international fanbase. At the same time, Fox's live telecast of the [[Super Bowl XLV]] helped the network emerge as the first U.S. television network to earn an average single-night prime time audience of at least 100&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Super Bowl XLV Most Watched TV Show; Post-Game 'Glee' Trails 'Undercover Boss'|url=https://deadline.com/2011/02/the-super-bowl-tied-as-highest-rated-ever-104171/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=February 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Idol'' lost its first place standing among all network prime time programs during the [[American Idol (season 11)|2011–12 finale]] (falling to second that season behind ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]''), ending the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|longest streak at#1]] for a prime time broadcast network series in U.S. television history, through its eight-year ratings domination in both the Adults 18–49 demographic and total viewership. ''Idol'' also remained in the Nielsen Top 10 for eleven years from [[2002–03 United States network television schedule|2003]] to [[2012–13 United States network television schedule|2013]], and became the highest-rated non-[[broadcasting of sports events|sports]] prime time television program as well as the highest-rated reality series in the U.S. from 2003 to 2012. these records marked the longest Nielsen ratings streaks of any Fox program in these categories.

The 2012 season finale of ''American Idol'' marked the end of the season-long 25th anniversary of the establishment of Fox network, helping it win in the 18–49 demographic for the eighth consecutive season, the longest such streak according to Nielsen measurement records (and still standing as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). However, Fox suffered a collapse in viewership during the [[2012-13 United States network television schedule|2012–13 season]]; ''American Idol'' and ''Glee'' suffered steep ratings declines, while the network as a whole fell to third place (suffering an overall decrease by 22%) in total viewership and to second place in the 18–49 demographic (where it remained {{as of|2014|lc=y}}) by the end of the season.

The decline in ratings continued into the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 season]], with Fox placing fourth among the major networks in total viewership for the first time since [[2000–01 United States network television schedule|2001]]. Subsequently, on January 13, 2014, Fox announced that it would abandon its use of the standard concept of greenlighting shows through the initial order of pilot episodes during the designated &quot;pilot season&quot; (running from January through April), instead opting to pick up shows directly to series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox to abandon pilot system, reveals network's chairman Kevin Reilly|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a543703/fox-to-abandon-pilot-system-reveals-networks-chairman-kevin-reilly.html|author=Meg Drewett|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox scored renewed ratings successes with its February 2014 live telecast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], which became the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|second most watched television broadcast]] (by average) in U.S. history, and the lead-out programs that followed this event – ''New Girl'' and ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]''.

The [[2014–15 United States network television schedule|2014–15 season]] saw the series finale of ''Glee'' and debut of hits in the freshmen dramas ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' (based on the [[Batman]] mythos) and the [[Lee Daniels]]-produced ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''. Ratings for ''Empire'', in particular, increased week-to-week throughout its first season, becoming the network's first successful ''American Idol'' lead-out since ''House'', as well as the first American television program to consistently increase its episode-to-episode viewership during its first five weeks since the [[1991–92 United States network television schedule|1992]] feat set by ABC's ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''. ''Empire'' ended its inaugural season as the first U.S. television show ever to increase its episodic viewership on a consistent basis throughout the course of a single season, as well as Fox's fourth program overall (and the first since the [[American Idol (season 12)|2013 finale]] of ''American Idol'') to enter the Nielsen Top 10 by the end of the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox's 'Empire' Sets Growth Standard|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/83608/foxs-empire-sets-growth-standard|author=David Bauder|agency=Associated Press|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empire Finale Ratings Are Here and Just Bonkers|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/637444/empire-finale-ratings-are-here-and-just-bonkers|author=Chris Harnick|website=[[E!|E!

The [[2015–16 United States network television schedule|2015–16 season]] marked a notable turnaround for Fox, as it jumped ahead of ABC to third place in nationwide ratings (both in overall viewership and in the 18–49 demo) and posted several firsts for the network and on U.S. television. Its improvement was boosted by the transfer of the [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss USA]] pageants from NBC, as well as shows such as ''[[Grease: Live]]'', ''Empire'' and the return of ''[[The X-Files]]'' after its most recent season ending in 2002. ''Grease: Live'' became the first live American TV musical special of the 21st century to be broadcast in front of a live studio audience (as well as the first ever live musical special aired by a non-Big Three network on primetime).

By 2016, ''[[Empire (season 2)|Empire]]'' and ''[[The X-Files (season 10)|The X-Files]]'' ranked in the Nielsen Top 10 for the season, the first season with 2 Fox programs entering the top rankings since the ''American Idol''-''House'' tandem of the 2007–2008 season (and the first ever season that Fox achieved such rankings without ''American Idol'' or any other reality television show from Fox in the Top 10). The same year also marked the [[American Idol (season 15)|finale]] of ''American Idol'' in its original run on Fox after airing for fifteen seasons, ending an era of one of the most successful shows in U.S. television history.

In February 2017, Fox broadcast [[Super Bowl LI]], which attracted an average 111.3 million viewers—ranking among the top five most-watched Super Bowl games, and the second-highest audience in network history behind Super Bowl XLVIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Perez|first=A.

It was acknowledged that Fox had placed a larger emphasis on its sports programming in its first upfronts since the deal was announced, including the acquisitions of the NFL's ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package and rights to the [[FIFA World Cup]]. It was also noted that Fox had been increasingly pivoting towards programs that could generate large audiences, as opposed to ones that become successful primarily through critical acclaim. On June 27, 2018, [[WWE]] announced that ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' would move to Fox and return to airing on Friday nights beginning October 4, 2019, following its run on [[USA Network]], under a five-year contract valued at $205&amp;nbsp;million per-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-wwe-close-five-year-deal-bring-smackdown-network-1123487|title=Fox and WWE Close Five-Year Deal to Bring 'SmackDown' to Network|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2018/06/27/wwe-fox-smackdown-live-usa-monday-night-raw-five-year-deal|title=Cord cutting, millennials can't stop Vince McMahon and WWE|last=Traina|first=Jimmy|work=Sports Illustrated|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/15/what-the-fox-television-network-could-look-like-after-the-disney-acquisition/|title=Analysis {{!}} What the Fox television network could look like after the Disney acquisition|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/until-foxs-post-disney-future-becomes-clearer-some-tv-writers-may-keep-their-distance/|title=Until Fox's Post-Disney Future Becomes Clearer, Some TV Writers May Keep Their Distance|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fox-broadcasting-future-murdoch-shakeup-1202809801/|title=Fox Broadcasting Faces Radical Changes — and No One Knows the End Result|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=2018-05-15|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also began to increase its non-scripted output, announcing the new celebrity music competition series ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' (based on the South Korean format ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''), and the new game shows ''[[Mental Samurai]]'' and ''[[Spin the Wheel (game show)|Spin the Wheel]]'' for the 2018–19 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline-newfoxindie&quot;/&gt;

In August 2018, Fox Television Group CEO Dana Walden outlined how the network would operate following the transition to New Fox. The network will commission and acquire series from &quot;independent&quot; studios (such as [[Lionsgate]], [[MGM Television]], [[Sony Pictures Television]], and [[Warner Bros.]], the last of which being a co-owner of The CW with CBS but not outright owning a major broadcast network). Walden noted that the [[vertical integration]] of the major broadcast networks (including Fox itself) with associated studios had limited opportunities for outside studios, and cited several top programs that were distributed by third-parties, such as ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and ''[[This Is Us]]'' (produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and 20th Television for CBS and NBC respectively). There are also plans for Fox to acquire new pitches directly from their writers, and offer them to outside producers. As part of the transition, Fox aimed to gradually reduce the amount of scripted programming development coming from 20th Century Fox Television, although stalwarts such as ''The Simpsons'' will remain with the network.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline-newfoxindie&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/new-fox-plans-independent-studios-program-ownership-tca-dana-walden-gary-newman-1202438665/|title=Fox Bosses Lay Out &quot;New Fox&quot; Plans To Court Independent Studios, Take Program Ownership – TCA|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2018-08-02|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of the sale, network head Dana Walden became chairwoman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]] president Charlie Collier succeeded Gary Newman as chairman and CEO of Fox on November 1, 2018. Newman was expected to temporarily remain with Fox in a transitional role, in order to oversee the corporate transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amcs-charlie-collier-run-fox-network-gary-newman-exit-1154001|title=AMC's Charlie Collier to Run Fox Network; Gary Newman to Exit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/business/media/fox-network-charlie-collier.html|title=Fox Network Is Replacing Chief With Charlie Collier of AMC|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nov16bombshell&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/channing-dungey-abc-karey-burke-1203031129/|title=Channing Dungey Exits ABC; Karey Burke Named Network President|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=2018-11-16|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/channing-dungey-exits-abc-karey-burke-take-as-entertainment-president-1162211|title=Channing Dungey Exits ABC; Karey Burke to Take Over as Entertainment President|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/disney-fox-peter-rice-dana-walden-analysis-1202972856/|title=Analysis: Peter Rice, Dana Walden Tasked With Forging New Path for Production at Enlarged Disney |last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2018-10-08|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of 2019 saw ''The Masked Singer'' premiere to Fox's highest ratings for a non-scripted premiere without an NFL lead-in since 2011, and record the largest-ever Nielsen ratings gain for a non-scripted series after three days of delayed viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-ratings-1203101918/ |title='The Masked Singer' Scores Biggest Live+3 Lift Ever for Unscripted Series|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=2019-01-07|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;deadline-maskedsingerpremiere&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/the-masked-singer-premiere-hippo-wins-wednesday-ratings-1202528469/|title='The Masked Singer' Hippo Reveal Marks Best Unscripted Series Launch In 7 Years|website=Deadline|access-date= 2019-01-14 |date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/live-plus-7-ratings-week-of-dec-31-masked-singer-1203114367/|title=Live+7 Ratings for Week of Dec. 31: 'Masked Singer' Premiere Grows by 40 Percent|last=Otterson |first= Joe |date= 2019-01-22|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2019, Fox ordered a second season, while the season finale saw an average audience of 11.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-season-finale-ratings-1203151933/|title=TV Ratings: 'Masked Singer' Dominates With Season Finale|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date= 2019-02-28 |website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/the-masked-singer-renewed-season-2-fox-1202545353/|title='The Masked Singer' Renewed For Season 2 By Fox|last=Petski|first=Denise|date= 2019-01-30 |website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Fox}}
{{As of|2015}}, Fox currently provides 19 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides fifteen hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and Sundays from 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (all times Eastern and Pacific). An hour of late night programming is also offered on Saturdays from 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, a former hour of original comedy, but currently a repeat hour for primetime series (though scheduling for that hour varies depending on the market due to late local newscasts airing in the traditional 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m./10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. timeslot on some Fox stations). Weekend daytime programming consists of the [[infomercial|paid programming]] block ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' (airing Saturdays from 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., although the block is not carried by all affiliates and, in some areas, is offered to another station in the market), and the hour-long [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political discussion show]] – and the network's only regular national news program – ''[[Fox News Sunday]] with [[Chris Wallace]]'' (airing from 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern and Pacific, although the timeslot also varies by market due to local news or [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programming).

Sports programming is also provided; usually on weekends (albeit not every weekend year-round), and most commonly airing between 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or as late as 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Sundays (often airing for longer hours during the National Football League season, slightly less during [[NASCAR]] season); between 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (during [[Major League Baseball|baseball]], [[college football]], and [[college basketball]] season) on Saturday afternoons; and during prime time on certain Saturday evenings. The Saturday prime time block if any sports programming is scheduled for a particular week on that night currently varies between occasional [[Premier Boxing Champions]] events, Major League Baseball, or NASCAR coverage in the late winter and early spring/summer, and [[Fox College Football|college football coverage]] during the fall.

===Adult animation===
{{Main|Animation Domination|Animation on Fox|Animation Domination High-Def}}
Except for ''[[Futurama]]'', which was cancelled in 2003, typically every Sunday night during prime time (unless preempted, usually by sports telecasts), Fox airs a lineup incorporating original adult animation series, all being produced (or co-produced with Fox for post-2019 works) by the network's original sister company, 20th Television, which is currently a subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Television]]. This block of adult cartoons became a staple of the network airing under the brand ''[[Animation Domination]]'' from May 1, 2005 to September 14, 2014, when the network rebranded the block as ''Sunday Funday'' as a result of the re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Sunday Funday Will Probably Be Animation Domination Again By Next Year|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Why-Sunday-Funday-Probably-Animation-Domination-Again-By-Next-Year-67537.html|author=Jesse Carp|website=Cinema Blend|publisher=Cinema Blend LLC|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aside from occasional burn-offs of series aired on other nights during the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific hour), although animated series remain an integral part of that night's schedule.

The first programs to air as part of the ''Animation Domination'' lineup were ''[[American Dad!]]'' (which also had its beginnings in the lineup, and moved to [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] in October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox to air Seth MacFarlane's &quot;Bordertown&quot; animated series next year|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2013/11/09/Seth-MacFarlanes-Bordertown-picked-up-by-Fox/UPI-96291384015624/?spt=rln&amp;or=1|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TBSrevival&gt;{{cite news|title=Seth MacFarlane's 'American Dad' picked up by TBS|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/american-dad-picked-tbs-article-1.1400187|author=David Hinckley|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman|Daily News L.P.]]|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zap2it1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic-Con 2013: 'American Dad' Season 10 guest stars include Zooey Deschanel, Alison Brie and Mariah Carey|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html|author=Mike Rougeau|website=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|date=July 20, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822112804/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html|archivedate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[Family Guy]]'' (which returned to the network after a three-year cancellation when ''Animation Domination'' began), ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (the longest-running cartoon on Fox, predating the lineup by 16 years), and ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (which also predated the lineup by eight years). Animated shows currently airing as part of the lineup include ''The Simpsons'', ''Family Guy'', ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'', ''[[Bless the Harts]]'', and ''[[Duncanville (TV series)|Duncanville]]''. In addition to ''King of the Hill'', series that have previously aired on the lineup have included ''[[Sit Down, Shut Up (2009 TV series)|Sit Down, Shut Up]]'', ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]'', and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

An extension of the Sunday prime-time block called &quot;[[Animation Domination High-Def]]&quot; launched on Saturday late nights in July 2013 (marking the return of first-run programming in that time period since the 2010 cancellation of ''[[The Wanda Sykes Show]]''), with ''ADHD Shorts'', ''[[Axe Cop (TV series)|Axe Cop]]'' and ''[[High School USA!]]''. Due to low ratings, Fox announced on April 17, 2014, that it would discontinue &quot;Animation Domination High-Def&quot;; although the block was slated to end on June 28, 2014,&lt;ref name=&quot;thr-primetimeadhd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Plans Animation Domination HD for Primetime in 2015, Nixes Late Night|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-plans-animation-domination-hd-697392|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Guggenheim Partners|Prometheus Global Media]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bandc-scrapped&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Fox Scrapping Animation Domination HD Saturday Block|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/exclusive-fox-scrapping-animation-domination-hd-saturday-block/130545|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it continued to air in encore form until the start of the 2016–17 season, when the hour returned to airing encores of comedies or reality series.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|Fox Kids|4Kids TV|Xploration Station}}
Fox began airing children's programming on September 8, 1990 with the debut of the Fox Children's Network (rebranded as the Fox Kids Network in 1991, and then to simply [[Fox Kids]] in 1998), a [[block programming|programming block]] that aired on [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]] and [[Weekday cartoon|weekday afternoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox network will test a new idea in airing children's programs|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/07/28/page/59/article/fox-network-will-test-a-new-idea-in-airing-childrens-programs|author=Eric Mink|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 28, 1990|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming within the Fox Kids block consisted mainly of animated series, although it also featured some live-action series as part of the lineup. Shows featured in the block included ''[[Bobby's World]]'', ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Fun House (American game show)|Fun House]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Digimon Adventure|Digimon]]''; it also aired select shows from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] including the popular animated series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (Warner Bros. pulled ''Batman'' and ''Animaniacs'' from the Fox Kids lineup in September 1995, moving both shows, as well as ''Tiny Toons'' – which had already ended its run – to the newly launched [[Kids' WB]] block on The WB). Fox Kids' most successful series, however, was ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' (from eventual sister company and Fox Kids co-parent [[Saban Entertainment]]), which debuted in 1993 and became the block's flagship program until it moved to ABC and [[Toon Disney]] in 2002.

In October 2001, Fox sold its children's division, Saban Entertainment and [[ABC Family Worldwide|Fox Family Worldwide]] (the parent subsidiary of cable network Fox Family Channel, now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]) to The Walt Disney Company for $5.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News Corp. and Haim Saban Reach Agreement to Sell Fox Family Worldwide to Disney for $5.3 Billion |url=http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html |website=[[Saban Entertainment]] |date=July 23, 2001 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421070416/http://www.saban.com/html/press/010723.html |archivedate=April 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The network relegated the Fox Kids block to Saturdays in January 2002 (turning over the two-hour timeslot held by the weekday block to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult-oriented daytime shows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox outgrows kids programs|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117855508.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914072218/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117855508.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 14, 2012|author=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 7, 2001|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;); then on September 14, 2002, as part of a time-lease agreement with [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] to program the remaining four-hour Saturday morning lineup, Fox Kids was replaced by a new children's program block called FoxBox (which was renamed [[4Kids TV]] in February 2005).

Fox discontinued the 4Kids TV block on December 27, 2008, due to conflicts between the network and 4Kids Entertainment that were later settled, regarding 4Kids' failure to pay Fox for the programming lease rights, and the network's inability to fulfill a promise guaranteeing clearance on 90% of its stations and to get other stations to carry the block in certain markets where a Fox station declined it (an issue that plagued Fox's children's program blocks since the start of its affiliation deal with New World Communications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Ends Saturday-Morning Cartoons |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=November 24, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403021926/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/business/media/25kidstv.html |archivedate=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox had earlier announced, on November 23, that it would no longer carry children's programming in the time period, citing stiff competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic; the network instead turned over two of the four vacant Saturday morning hours to its affiliates to allow them to air local newscasts or [[E/I|educational programs]] purchased from the syndication market, while it retained the remaining two hours to run a network-managed paid programming block, ''Weekend Marketplace'', which debuted on January 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Longform ads replace kid fare on Fox|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996360.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|author=Michael Schneider|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 23, 2008|accessdate=June 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903022442/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996360.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|archive-date=September 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2014, ''[[Xploration Station]]'', a two-hour syndicated block produced by [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]], began airing on Fox stations owned by several affiliate groups including Fox Television Stations and [[Tribune Broadcasting]]. The block, which complies with guidelines defined by the [[Children's Television Act]], features programs focused on the [[STEM fields]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xploration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Rotfield Clears New Science and Technology Two Hour E/I Block With FOX Station Group|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/12/18/steve-rotfield-clears-new-science-and-technology-two-hour-ei-block-with-fox-station-group/223509/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222140946/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/12/18/steve-rotfield-clears-new-science-and-technology-two-hour-ei-block-with-fox-station-group/223509/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 22, 2013|author=Amanda Kondolojy|website=TV by the Numbers|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations can choose to either carry ''Xploration Station'' or continue to air ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' (as the Sinclair Broadcast Group chose to do, since it already carries syndicated E/I programming purchased by the company across its Fox affiliates, although Sinclair added the block on most of its Fox affiliates in September 2016).

===News===
{{See also|Fox News}}
Unlike ABC, CBS, and NBC, Fox does not currently air national news programs (morning, evening or overnight) or [[News magazine#Broadcast news magazines|newsmagazine]]s choosing to focus solely on its prime time schedule, sports and other ancillary network programming. The absence of a national news program on the Fox network is despite the fact that its parent company, Fox Corporation, owns [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]], which launched in October 1996 and currently maintains near-universal distribution within the United States via pay television providers. Fox News is not structured as a news division of the Fox network, and operates as a technically separate entity within Fox Corporation through the company's Fox News Group subsidiary. However, it does produce some content that is carried by the broadcast network, which is usually separate from the news coverage aired by the cable channel; in particular, FNC anchor [[Bill Hemmer]] anchors most prime time news presentations on the Fox network, especially during political news events (which are anchored by [[Bret Baier]] on Fox News Channel).

Specifically, the Fox network airs coverage of the [[State of the Union address]], [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]], national election coverage, as well as live [[breaking news]] coverage currently branded as a &quot;Fox News Special Report&quot; (also branded as a &quot;Fox News Alert&quot; or sometimes a &quot;Fox News Red Alert&quot;); carriage of such special coverage of a breaking news story may vary from station to station, and is often limited to events that occur during the network's usual prime time block (for example, unlike the Big Three, Fox does not often provide coverage of major [[political convention]] speeches, which usually occur during the 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern Time) hour during which most of its affiliates air local newscasts; however, the majority of Fox's owned-and-operated stations and affiliate groups do carry weekday breaking news briefs). The political discussion show ''Fox News Sunday'' also airs on the Fox network on Sunday mornings and is rebroadcast later in the day on FNC. Fox also operates an affiliate news service called Fox NewsEdge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox NewsEdge|url=https://www.foxnewsedge.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124204427/http://foxnewsedge.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2003|website=Fox NewsEdge|publisher=Fox News Network, LLC|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched with Fox News Channel in 1996, and provides national and international news reports, and feature stories for Fox stations to use in their own local newscasts.

Fox first tried its hand at a national news program in prime time with the hour-long weekly newsmagazine ''[[The Reporters (1988 TV program)|The Reporters]]'', which was produced by the same team behind the Fox Television Stations-distributed syndicated tabloid program ''[[A Current Affair (American TV program)|A Current Affair]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Nose For Tabloid News &quot;The Reporters&quot; Offers Teasing Sensations And Tales Reminiscent Of Supermarket Checkout Lines|url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-08-13/news/26255071_1_sad-tale-tawdry-tales-reporters|author=Ken Tucker|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|date=August 13, 1988|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Fox Newsmagazine Perfects 'Tabloid TV'|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/New-Fox-Newsmagazine-Perfects-Tabloid-TV-/id-14869d1c6bc32b52f3ddc058978aefec|author=Kathryn Baker|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 28, 1988|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program ran from 1988 to 1990, when it was cancelled due to low ratings. From 1987 until about 1996, Fox also aired news capsules that aired within its prime time schedule, branded first as ''Fox News Extra'', and later as ''Fox News Updates'', which were produced at New York City O&amp;O WNYW and used their anchors. Another failed attempt occurred in 1993, when Fox launched ''[[Front Page (newsmagazine)|Front Page]]'' (which included among its five hosts, [[Ron Reagan]] and [[Josh Mankiewicz]]), in an attempt to capture a younger demographic for a newsmagazine program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox News To Launch 'Front Page' With An Eye To Younger Viewers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-26/entertainment/9306260023_1_fox-style-ron-reagan-newsmagazine|author=Stephen Galloway|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|via=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 26, 1993|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox's 'Front Page' slithers its way into tabloid-TV|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-06-26/features/1993177099_1_paramount-tabloid-tv-con-artists|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 26, 1993|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network tried its hand at a newsmagazine again in 1998 with ''Fox Files'', hosted by Fox News Channel anchors [[Catherine Crier]] and [[Jon Scott]], as well as a team of correspondents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FOX OFFERS ANOTHER NEWSMAG, 'FOX FILES'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1998/07/12/fox-offers-another-newsmag-fox-files/c0f3083a-9a13-4cd0-a2ff-48859c72cc18/|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=July 12, 1998|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it lasted a little over a year before being cancelled. Its last attempt at a newsmagazine series occurred during the 2002–03 [[Sweeps|sweeps period]], with ''The Pulse'', hosted by Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Pulse' bets newsmagazines still have one|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-11/features/0207110308_1_fox-report-fox-files-fox-news-channel|author=Allan Johnson|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 11, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, 2016, the network aired an interview special with then Fox News primetime anchor [[Megyn Kelly]], ''Megyn Kelly Presents''.

Fox also attempted national morning programs, only the first of which aired on the network itself. Its first venture at such a program was ''Fox After Breakfast'', an hour-long morning news and lifestyle show, hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]], [[Laurie Hibberd]], and [[Vicki Lawrence]], that ran on the network from 1996 to 1998 (Fox aired the program at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. – as opposed to the 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. time slot that NBC, CBS, and ABC air their national morning shows – in order to accommodate local morning newscasts that ran in the latter slot on some of its stations); the program originated as ''Breakfast Time'' in 1995 on sister cable channel FX. Fox tried again in 2002 with ''[[Good Day Live]]'', a heavily entertainment-focused syndicated offshoot of ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'', a news/entertainment/lifestyle program that debuted in 1993 on Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KTTV;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.A. morning show bids 'Good Day' to whole country|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-07-07/entertainment/0207070491_1_jillian-barberie-morning-show-day-live|author=Jay Bobbin|agency=Tribune Media Services|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=July 7, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the national version of the program was cancelled in 2005. On January 22, 2007, Fox premiered ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'' on its owned-and-operated stations; hosted by [[Mike Jerrick]] and [[Juliet Huddy]] (then-anchors of Fox News Channel's ''[[DaySide]]''), the show was lighter in format and more entertainment-oriented, though its focus often changed when a major news story occurred. In February 2007, the program was syndicated to other stations including many affiliated with ABC, NBC and CBS in markets where it was not carried by a Fox or [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate; ''The Morning Show'' was cancelled in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Website : Where To Watch?|url=http://www.mandjshow.com/where-to-watch/|website=[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]|publisher=[[News Corp.

===Sports===
{{Main|Fox Sports (United States)}}
{{see also|Fox Sports 1|Fox Sports 2}}
When the network launched, Fox management, having seen the critical role that sports programming soccer events, in particular had played in the growth of the British satellite service [[BSkyB]], believed that sports – and specifically, [[American football|professional football]] would be the engine that would make Fox a major network the quickest. In 1987, after ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to broadcast ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', Fox made an offer to the National Football League to acquire the rights for the same amount that ABC had been paying, about $13&amp;nbsp;million per game at the time. However, partly due to the fact that Fox had not yet established itself as a major network, the NFL chose to renew its contract with ABC (where ''Monday Night Football'' remained until its move to sister cable channel [[ESPN]] in September 2006).

Six years later, when the league entered contract negotiations with its television partners, Fox placed a $1.58&amp;nbsp;billion bid to obtain broadcast rights to the National Football Conference – covering four seasons of games, beginning with the 1994 NFL season.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOXNFC&quot;/&gt; The NFL selected the Fox bid on December 18, 1993, stripping CBS of football telecasts for the first time since 1955. The event placed Fox on par with the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks and ushered in an era of growth for the NFL. Fox's acquisition of the NFL rights also quickly led toward the network reaching an affiliation deal with New World Communications to change the affiliations of twelve of its stations to Fox ([[#Luring the NFL and affiliation switches|see above]]). The rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other programs.

With a sports division now established with the arrival of the NFL, Fox acquired broadcast television rights to the [[National Hockey League]] (1994–99),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox Outbids CBS for N.H.L.

From 2007 to 2010, Fox aired the [[Bowl Championship Series]]—a group of college football [[bowl game]]s held around [[New Year's Day]], and the [[BCS National Championship Game]] (with the exception of any event held at the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]], including the [[Rose Bowl Game]] and the Rose Bowl-hosted [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]], as their organizer maintained a separate contract with [[ESPN College Football on ABC|ABC]]). Following the conclusion of the deal, Fox acquired rights to the [[Big Ten Conference]] and [[Pac-12 Conference]]'s newly established football championship games (the latter alternating yearly with ESPN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox To Air New Big Ten Football Championship Game – Broadcaster Secures Rights To Conference's Title Tilt From 2011–16|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/460047-Fox_To_Air_New_Big_Ten_Football_Championship_Game.php|work=Multichannel News|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ESPN, Fox Tie Up Pac-12 Rights For $3 Billion: Reports|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/467747-ESPN_Fox_Tie_Up_Pac_12_Rights_For_3_Billion_Reports.php|magazine=Multichannel News|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Fox acquired tier 1 rights to the Big Ten Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/05/ohio_state_vs_michigan_rivalry.html|title=Ohio State vs. Michigan football rivalry to be televised on FOX during 2017 season|last=Landis|first=Bill|date=15 May 2017|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/ncaa/know-new-big-ten-rights-deal.html|title=What we know about the new Big Ten rights deal|date=2017-07-31|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Fox and [[mixed martial arts]] promotion [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) reached a multi-year agreement, which included the rights to broadcast four live events in prime time or late night annually, marking the first time that the UFC aired its events on broadcast television. Its first [[UFC on Fox]] event, Velasquez vs. Dos Santos, aired on November 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= It's Official: UFC and Fox Are Now in Business Together|url=http://mmaweekly.com/its-official-ufc-and-fox-are-now-in-business-together|website=MMAWeekly.com|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deal ended at the end of 2018, with UFC events moving to [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN+]].

The network's telecast of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] remains the highest rated program in the history of the network, and the second-highest-rated U.S. television program of all time.

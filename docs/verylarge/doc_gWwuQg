There have been calls in the early 21st century for the [[Nobel Foundation]] to rescind the prize it awarded to Moniz for developing lobotomy, a decision that has been called an astounding error of judgment at the time and one that psychiatry might still need to learn from, but the Foundation declined to take action and has continued to host an article defending the results of the procedure.&lt;ref name=JanssonBengt29October1998&gt;{{cite web|last=Jansson|first=Bengt|title=Controversial Psychosurgery Resulted in a Nobel Prize, first published 29 October 1998|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1949/moniz-article.html|work=Official website of the Nobel Prize|publisher=www.Nobelprize.org|access-date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sutherland|2004|ps=}}

==Notable cases==
{{category see also|Lobotomised people}}
* [[Rosemary Kennedy]], sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]], underwent a lobotomy in 1941 that left her incapacitated and institutionalized for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Feldman|2001|p=271|ps=}}
* [[Howard Dully]] wrote a memoir of his late-life discovery that he had been lobotomized in 1960 at age 12.{{sfn|Day|2008|ps=}}
* New Zealand author and poet [[Janet Frame]] received a literary award in 1951 the day before a scheduled lobotomy was to take place, and it was never performed.{{sfn|Martin|2004|ps=}}
* [[Josef Hassid]], a Polish violinist and composer, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and died at the age of 26 following a lobotomy.{{sfn|Prior|2008|ps=}}
* Swedish modernist painter [[Sigrid Hjertén]] died following a lobotomy in 1948.{{sfn|Snyder|Steffen-Fluhr|2012|p=52|ps=}}
* American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]]' older sister Rose received a lobotomy that left her incapacitated for life; the episode is said to have inspired characters and motifs in certain works of his.{{sfn|Kolin|1998|pp=50–51|ps=}}
* It is often said that when an iron rod was accidentally driven through the head of [[Phineas Gage]] in 1848, this constituted an &quot;accidental lobotomy&quot;, or that this event somehow inspired the development of surgical lobotomy a century later. According to the only book-length study of Gage, careful inquiry turns up no such link.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|last=Macmillan|year1=2000|year2=1999–2012|loc1=p. 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In 2011, Daniel Nijensohn, an Argentine-born neurosurgeon at Yale, examined X-rays of [[Eva Perón]] and concluded that she underwent a lobotomy for the treatment of pain and anxiety in the last months of her life.{{sfn|Nijensohn|2012|p=582|ps=}}

==Literary and cinematic portrayals==
&lt;!--  ====&gt; DO NOT REMOVE THESE &quot;DO NOT&quot;s -- EXPERIENCE SHOWS THEY'RE NEEDED  &lt;==== --&gt;
&lt;!--  DO ''not'' ADD PASSING MENTIONS, HORROR FILMS, VIDEO GAMES, etc. Entries must be supported by reliable secondary sources explaining how it either reflects/reflected, or changed, popular perception of lobotomy. Do not include references in songs, television shows that happen to use the word &quot;lobotomy&quot; as a metaphor or a passing mention, or use of lobotomy as a plot device such as a horror movie.

Lobotomies have been featured in several literary and cinematic presentations that both reflected society's attitude towards the procedure and, at times, changed it. Writers and film-makers have played a pivotal role in turning public sentiment against the procedure.{{sfn|Sutherland|2004|ps=}}

* [[Robert Penn Warren|Robert Penn Warren's]] 1946 novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'' describes a lobotomy as making &quot;a Comanche brave look like a tyro with a scalping knife&quot;, and portrays the surgeon as a repressed man who cannot change others with love, so he instead resorts to &quot;high-grade carpentry work&quot;.{{sfn|Grenander|1978|pp=42–44|ps=}}

* Tennessee Williams criticized lobotomy in his play ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1958) because it was sometimes inflicted on [[LGBT|homosexuals]]—to render them &quot;morally sane&quot;.{{sfn|Sutherland|2004|ps=}} In the play a wealthy matriarch offers the local mental hospital a substantial donation if the hospital will give her niece a lobotomy, which she hopes will stop the niece's shocking revelations about the matriarch's son.{{sfn|Bigsby|1985|p=100|ps=}} Warned that a lobotomy might not stop her niece's &quot;babbling&quot;, she responds, &quot;That may be, maybe not, but after the operation who would ''believe'' her, Doctor?&quot;{{sfn|Williams|1998|p=15|ps=}}

* In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and its [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|1975 film adaptation]], lobotomy is described as &quot;frontal-lobe castration&quot;, a form of punishment and control after which &quot;There's nothin' in the face. Just like one of those store dummies.&quot; In one patient, &quot;You can see by his eyes how they burned him out over there; his eyes are all smoked up and gray and deserted inside.&quot;{{sfn|Grenander|1978|pp=42–44|ps=}}

* [[Elliott Baker]]'s 1964 novel and 1966 film version, ''[[A Fine Madness]]'', portrays the dehumanizing lobotomy of a womanizing, quarrelsome poet who, afterwards, is just as aggressive as ever. The surgeon is depicted as an inhumane crackpot.{{sfn|Gabbard|Gabbard|1999|pp=119–20|ps=}}

* The 1982 [[biopic]] film ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'' depicts actress [[Frances Farmer]] (the subject of the film) undergoing transorbital lobotomy (though the idea{{sfn|Arnold|1982}} that a lobotomy was performed on Farmer, and that Freeman performed it, has been criticized as having little or no factual foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bragg|2005|pp=72–75}}; {{harvnb|El-Hai|2005|pp=241–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 2018 film ''[[The Mountain (2018 film)|The Mountain]]'' centers around lobotomization, its cultural significance in the context of 1950s America, and mid-century attitudes surrounding mental health in general. The film interrogates the ethical and social implications of the practice through the experiences of its protagonist, a young man whose late mother had been lobotomized. The protagonist takes a job as a [[medical photography|medical photographer]] for the fictional Dr. Wallace Fiennes, portrayed by [[Jeff Goldblum|Jeff Goldblum]]. Fiennes is loosely based on Freeman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lapin |first1=Andrew |title=A Lobotomist Struggles To Hang On In The Brilliant, Blistering 'The Mountain' |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/25/744187127/a-lobotomist-struggles-to-hang-on-in-the-brilliant-blistering-the-mountain |access-date=8 November 2020 |agency=NPR |date=25 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kohn |first1=Eric |title=’The Mountain’ Review: Jeff Goldblum and Tye Sheridan Are Lost Souls in Rick Alverson’s Beautiful, Fractured America |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/the-mountain-review-jeff-goldblum-tye-sheridan-1201998966/ |access-date=8 November 2020 |agency=IndieWire |date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fendt Tractor Ripping up Kulin.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Cultivating after an early rain]]

'''Tillage''' is the [[agriculture|agricultural]] preparation of [[soil]] by mechanical [[wikt:agitation#Noun|agitation]] of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of [[manual labour|human-powered]] '''tilling''' methods using [[hand tool]]s include [[shovel]]ing, [[pickaxe|picking]], [[mattock]] work, [[hoe (tool)|hoeing]], and [[rake (tool)|raking]]. Examples of [[working animal|draft-animal-powered]] or [[mechanization|mechanized]] work include [[plough]]ing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), [[rotary tiller|rototilling]], rolling with [[cultipacker]]s or other [[roller (agricultural tool)|rollers]], [[harrow (tool)|harrowing]], and cultivating with [[cultivator]] shanks (teeth).

Tillage that is deeper and more thorough  is classified as primary, and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location is secondary. Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good [[seedbed]] for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation.

&quot;Tillage&quot; can also mean the land that is '''tilled'''. The word &quot;'''cultivation'''&quot; has several senses that overlap substantially with those of &quot;tillage&quot;. In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any kind of soil agitation. Additionally, &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;cultivating&quot; may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of [[row crop]] fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants.

==History of tilling==
[[File:Tilling with Hungarian Grey cattles.tif|thumb|Tilling with Hungarian Grey cattles]]
Tilling was first performed via human labor, sometimes involving [[Slavery|slaves]]. Hoofed animals could also be used to till soil by trampling, in addition to pigs, whose natural instincts are to [[Domestic pig#Rooting|root]] the ground regularly if allowed to. The wooden [[plow]] was then invented. It could be pulled with human labor, or by [[mule]], [[ox]], [[elephant]], [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], or similar sturdy animal. Horses are generally unsuitable, though breeds such as the [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] were bred as draft animals. The [[steel]] plow allowed farming in the [[American Midwest]], where tough [[prairie]] grasses and rocks caused trouble. Soon after 1900, the [[farm tractor]] was introduced, which eventually made modern large-scale [[agriculture]] possible.

Tilling could at times be very labor intensive. This aspect is discussed in the 16th century French [[agronomic]] text written by [[Charles Estienne]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A rawe, rough, and tough soile is hard to till, and will neither bring forth corne, nor any other thing without great labour, howsoever the seasons be temperat in moisture and dryness...you must labour it most exquisitely, harrow it and manure it verie oft with great store of dung, so you shall make it better...but especially desire that they may not be watered with raine, for water is as good as poyson to them&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of tillage==
===Primary and secondary tillage ===
Primary tillage is usually conducted after the last harvest, when the soil is wet enough to allow plowing but also allows good traction. Some soil types can be plowed dry. The objective of primary tillage is to attain a reasonable depth of soft soil, incorporate crop residues, kill weeds, and to aerate the soil. Secondary tillage is any subsequent tillage, in order to incorporate fertilizers, reduce the soil to a finer tilth, level the surface, or control weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of tillage |url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/ericeproduction/I.2_Types_of_tillage.htm |website=Knowledge Bank |accessdate=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduced tillage===
[[File:Ploughtilling the field.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Plough tilling the field]]
Reduced tillage&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;Systems&quot; /&gt; leaves between 15 and 30% crop residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period. This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements. See the general comments below to see how they can affect the amount of residue.

===Intensive tillage===
Intensive tillage&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;Systems&quot; /&gt; leaves less than 15% [[crop residue]] cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as [[conventional tillage]], but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CONSERVATION TILLAGE IN THE UNITED STATES: AN OVERVIEW |work=okstate.edu |url=http://agecon.okstate.edu/isct/labranza/walters/conservation.doc |publisher=Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska – Lincoln |page=Figure 2 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRM&gt;{{cite web |work=ctic.purdue.edu |url=http://www.ctic.purdue.edu/CRM |title=National Crop Residue Management (CRM) Survey Summary (various years) |publisher=Conservation Technology Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or chisel [[Plough|plow]]. After this, a finisher with a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations.

===Conservation tillage===
Conservation tillage&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;Systems&quot; /&gt; leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb/ac (1,100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical [[soil erosion]] period. This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of soil erosion. Additionally, conservation tillage has been found to benefit predatory arthropods that can enhance pest control.&lt;ref&gt;Tamburini, G., De Simone, S., Sigura, M., Boscutti, F., Marini, L. and Kleijn, D. (2016), Conservation tillage mitigates the negative effect of landscape simplification on biological control. ''[[Journal of Applied Ecology]]'', 53: 233–241. [[doi:10.1111/1365-2664.12544]]&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, farmers realize significant savings in fuel and labor. 

Conservation tillage is used on over 370 million acres, mostly in South America, Oceania and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/06/reduced-soil-tilling-helps-soils-yields/|title=Reduced soil tilling helps both soils and yields|last=Horton|first=Michelle|date=2019-12-06|website=Stanford News|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRM&quot; /&gt; 

However, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year's spring crop of corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/machine/AE-1370/ae1370.htm |title=Strip Till for Field Crop Production |publisher=Ag.ndsu.edu |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[No-till]] – Never use a plow, disk, etc. ever again. Aims for 100% ground cover.
* [[Strip-Till]] – Narrow strips are tilled where seeds will be planted, leaving the soil in between the rows untilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;tce&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Management Practices for Conservation/Reduced Tillage|url=http://publications.tamu.edu/WHEAT/PUB_wheat_Best%2520Management%2520Practices%2520for%2520Conservation%2520Tillage.pdf |publisher=Texas Cooperative Extension, The Texas A&amp;M University System |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810225128/http://publications.tamu.edu/WHEAT/PUB_wheat_Best%20Management%20Practices%20for%20Conservation%20Tillage.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mulch-till]] - Soil is covered with mulch to conserve heat and moisture.100% soil disturbance.
* Rotational Tillage – Tilling the soil every two years or less often (every other year, or every third year, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;tce&quot;/&gt;
* Ridge-Till

===Zone tillage===
Zone tillage is a form of modified deep tillage in which only narrow strips are tilled, leaving soil in between the rows untilled. This type of tillage agitates the soil to help reduce [[soil compaction]] problems and to improve internal [[soil drainage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Zone Tillage&quot;&gt;[http://extension.umass.edu/vegetable/projects/deep-zone-tillage], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Vegetable Program. &quot;Deep Zone Tillage&quot;, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to only disrupt the soil in a narrow strip directly below the crop row. In comparison to no-till, which relies on the previous year's plant residue to protect the soil and aides in postponement of the warming of the soil and crop growth in Northern climates, zone tillage creates a strip approximately five inches wide that simultaneously breaks up plow pans, assists in warming the soil and helps to prepare a seedbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn State Extension&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/on-farm/research/miller |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513074243/http://extension.psu.edu/on-farm/research/miller |archivedate=13 May 2013 }} [[Pennsylvania State University]]. &quot;Evaluation of Zone Tillage for Corn Production&quot;, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with cover crops, zone tillage helps replace lost organic matter, slows the deterioration of the soil, improves soil drainage, increases soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and allows necessary soil organisms to survive.

It has been successfully used on farms in the Midwest and West for over 40 years, and is currently used on more than 36% of the U.S. farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Integrated Pest Management&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.uconn.edu/ipm/veg/htms/dpzonetill.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522091343/http://www.hort.uconn.edu/ipm/veg/htms/dpzonetill.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013 }}, Boucher, J. [[University of Connecticut]]. &quot;Soil Health and Deep-Zone Tillage&quot;, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some specific states where zone tillage is currently in practice are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois.

Unfortunately, its use in the Northern [[Cornbelt]] states lacks consistent yield results; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within the [[agriculture]] industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ag Answers&quot;&gt;[http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/AgAnswers/story.asp?storyID=1912], &quot;Fall Zone Tillage Conserves Soil, Yields Well&quot;, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage may be used as an alternative to installing more expensive tile drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Management Network&quot;&gt;[http://extension.umass.edu/vegetable/research-projects/deep-zone-tillage], DeJong-Hughes, J.

===Archaeology===
Tilling can damage ancient structures such as [[long barrows]]. In the UK, half of the long barrows in [[Gloucestershire]] and almost all the burial mounds in [[Essex]] have been damaged. According to [[English Heritage]] in 2003 ploughing with modern powerful tractors had done as much damage in the last six decades as traditional farming did in the previous six centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/030725_RippingUpHistory.pdf &quot;Ripping Up History&quot;] July 2003 English Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;

==General comments==
* The type of implement makes the most difference, although other factors can have an effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;miss-extension&quot;&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/agengin/g01650.htm Conservation Tillage and Residue Management to Reduce Soil Erosion] University of Missouri: Extension&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tilling in absolute darkness (night tillage) might reduce the number of weeds that sprout following the tilling operation by half. Light is necessary to break the dormancy of some weed species' seed, so if fewer seeds are exposed to light during the tilling process, fewer will sprout. This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/dec95/tilling1295.htm |title=Nightmare in Tilling Fields – a Horror for Weed Pests |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greater speeds, when using certain tillage implements (disks and chisel plows), lead to more intensive tillage (i.e., less residue is on the soil surface).
* Increasing the angle of disks causes residues to be buried more deeply. Increasing their concavity makes them more aggressive.
* Chisel plows can have spikes or sweeps. Spikes are more aggressive.
* Percentage residue is used to compare tillage systems because the amount of [[crop residue]] affects the soil loss due to erosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;miss-extension&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/icm/2002/5-13-2002/cropresidue.html |title=Methods for measuring crop residue |author1=Mahdi Al-Kaisi |author2=Mark Hanna |author3=Michael Tidman |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |date=13 May 2002 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Primary tillage'' loosens the soil and mixes in [[fertilizer]] and/or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture.

''Secondary tillage'' produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving [[herbicide]]s.
* The seedbed preparation can be done with [[harrow (tool)|harrows]] (of which there are many types and subtypes), [[dibber|dibble]]s, [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[rotary tiller]]s, [[subsoiler]]s, ridge- or bed-forming tillers, [[roller (agricultural tool)|roller]]s, or [[cultivator]]s.
* The weed control, to the extent that it is done via tillage, is usually achieved with cultivators or hoes, which disturb the top few centimeters of soil around the crop plants but with minimal disturbance of the crop plants themselves. The tillage kills the weeds via 2 mechanisms: uprooting them, burying their leaves (cutting off their [[photosynthesis]]), or a combination of both. Weed control both prevents the crop plants from being outcompeted by the weeds (for water and sunlight) and prevents the weeds from reaching their seed stage, thus reducing future weed population aggressiveness.

==Alternatives to tilling==
Modern [[agricultural science]] has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of [[herbicide]]s to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called [[no-till farming]], reduces costs and environmental change by reducing soil erosion and [[diesel fuel]] usage.

==Site preparation of forest land==
{{Split|Site preparation of forest land|section=yes|date=March 2019}}

Site preparation is any of various treatments applied to a site in order to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and [[Taiga|boreal]] tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;mck&quot;&gt;McKinnon, L.M.; Mitchell, A.K.; Vyse, A. 2002. The effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species: a bibliography. Nat. Resour., Can., Can. For. Serv., Victoria BC, Inf. Rep. BC-X-394. 29 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Site preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.

===Burning===
Broadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macadam 1987&quot;&gt;Macadam, A.M. 1987. Effects of broadcast slash burning on fuels and soil chemical properties in the sub-boreal spruce zone of central British Columbia. Can. J. For. Res. 17(12):1577–1584.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the temperate region of North America generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;kii&quot;&gt;Kiil, A.D.; Chrosciewicz, Z. 1970. Prescribed fire – its place in reforestation. For. Chron. 46:448–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:

:a) Reduction of logging slash, plant competition, and humus prior to direct seeding, planting, scarifying or in anticipation of natural seeding in partially cut stands or in connection with seed-tree systems.

:b) Reduction or elimination of unwanted forest cover prior to planting or seeding, or prior to preliminary scarification thereto.

:c) Reduction of humus on cold, moist sites to favour regeneration.

:d) Reduction or elimination of slash, grass, or brush fuels from strategic areas around forested land to reduce the chances of damage by wildfire.

Prescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;Scott, J.D. 1970. Direct seeding in Ontario. For. Chron. 46(6):453–457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987)&lt;ref name=&quot;Macadam 1987&quot; /&gt; in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7&amp;nbsp;cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change.&lt;ref name=&quot;holt&quot;&gt;Holt, L. 1955. White spruce seedbeds as related to natural regeneration. Pulp Paper Res. Instit. Can., Montreal QC. 28 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballard 1985&quot;&gt;Ballard, T.M. 1985. Spruce nutrition problems in the central interior and their relationship with site preparation. Proc. Interior spruce seedling performance: state of the art Symposium. Northern Silviculture Committee Workshop, Feb. 1985, Prince George BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954),&lt;ref name=&quot;tarr&quot;&gt;Tarrant, R.F. 1954. Effect of slash burning on soil pH. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific Northwest For. and Range Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Res. Note 102. 5 p.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.

Marked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter consumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macadam 1987&quot; /&gt; Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0&amp;nbsp;cm to 15&amp;nbsp;cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study&lt;ref name=&quot;tay&quot;&gt;Taylor, S.W.; Feller, M.C. 1987. Initial effects of slashburning on the nutrient status of Sub-boreal Spruce Zone ecosystems. ''In'' Papers presented at the Fire Management Symposium, April 1987, Prince George BC, Central Interior Fire Protection Committee, Smithers BC.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within 9 months.

Nitrogen will be lost from the site by burning,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macadam 1987&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;litt&quot;&gt;Little, S.N.; Klock, G.O. 1985. The influence of residue removal and prescribed fire on distribution of forest nutrients. USDA, For. Serv., Res. Pap. PNW-333.&lt;/ref&gt; though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987)&lt;ref name=&quot;Macadam 1987&quot; /&gt; to have increased in two out of six plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.

The '''American black bear''' (''Ursus americanus'') is a medium-sized [[bear]] native to [[North America]]. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are [[omnivore]]s, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas but will leave forests in search of food. They are sometimes attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is the world's most common bear species. The fur, though usually black, is not always this color.  Some subspecies do not show as black.

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) lists the American black bear as a [[least-concern species]], due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the [[brown bear]], it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
[[File:Ursus americanusDetail.jpg|thumb|left|American black bear head, [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]]]]

Despite living in North America, American black bears are not closely related to [[brown bear]]s and [[polar bear]]s; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 million years ago (mya).&lt;ref name=&quot;krause&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Krause, J. |author2=Unger, T. |author3=Noçon, A. |author4=Malaspinas, A. |author5=Kolokotronis, S. |author6=Stiller, M. |author7=Soibelzon, L. |author8=Spriggs, H. |author9=Dear, P.

A small primitive bear called ''Ursus abstrusus'' is the oldest known North American [[fossil]] member of the genus ''Ursus'', dated to 4.95 mya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Woodburne, Michael O. |title=Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic Mammals of North America: Biostratigraphy and Geochronology| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73ZaLf_LL9cC&amp;pg=PA252| year=2004| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=978-0-231-13040-0| pages=178, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that ''U. abstrusus'' may be the direct ancestor of the American black bear, which evolved in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;krause&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kurten&quot;&gt;Kurten, B., and E.

The American black bear lived during the same period as the giant and lesser [[short-faced bear]]s (''Arctodus simus'' and ''A. pristinus'', respectively) and the Florida spectacled bear (''[[Tremarctos floridanus]]'').

The American black bear's [[generalist species|generalist]] behavior allowed it to exploit a wider variety of foods and has been given as a reason why, of these three genera, it alone survived climate and vegetative changes through the [[Quaternary glaciation|last Ice Age]] while the other, more specialized North American predators became extinct. However, both ''Arctodus'' and ''Tremarctos'' had survived several other, previous [[ice age]]s. After these prehistoric ursids became extinct during the last glacial period 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, American black bears were probably the only bear present in much of North America until the migration of [[brown bear]]s to the rest of the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot; /&gt;

=== Hybrids ===
[[File:To replace picture in 'Ursid hybrid'.jpg|thumb|Possible hybrid [[grizzly bear]]-black bear in [[Yukon Territory]], [[Canada]]]]

American black bears are reproductively compatible with several other bear species and occasionally produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring. According to Jack Hanna's ''Monkeys on the Interstate'', a bear captured in [[Sanford, Florida]], was thought to have been the offspring of an escaped female [[Asian black bear]] and a male American black bear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101226205341/http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/hybrid-bears.htm &quot;Hybrid Bears&quot;]. messybeast.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, an American black bear and a [[Eurasian brown bear]] were bred together in the [[London Zoological Gardens]], but the three cubs that were born died before they reached maturity. In ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] noted:
{{quote|In the nine-year Report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the zoological gardens to couple freely, but previously to 1848 most had rarely conceived. In the reports published since this date three species have produced young (hybrids in one case),&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Darwin |year=1868 |title=The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication |volume=2 |edition=1st |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_VariationunderDomestication.html |page=151 |isbn=978-1-4068-4250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A bear shot in autumn 1986 in [[Michigan]] was thought by some to be an American black bear/grizzly bear hybrid, due to its unusually large size and its proportionately larger brain case and skull. DNA testing was unable to determine whether it was a large American black bear or a grizzly bear.&lt;ref name=&quot;hybrid&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Richard P. |year=2007 |chapter=Hybrid Black Bear |title=Black Bear Hunting |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]] |isbn=978-0-8117-0269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}

The current range of American black bears in the United States is constant throughout most of the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and within the [[Appalachian Mountains]] almost continuously from [[Maine]] to northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the [[Mountain States|Rocky Mountain region]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ScheickMcCown&quot; /&gt; However, it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions.

Surveys taken from 35 states in the early 1990s indicate that American black bears are either stable or increasing, except in [[Idaho]] and [[New Mexico]]. The overall population of American black bears in the United States has been estimated to range between 339,000 and 465,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;us&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wwf.ca/newsroom/?1058| title=United States Population| publisher=World Wildlife Fund| access-date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this excludes populations from [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]] and [[Wyoming]], whose population sizes are unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan&quot; /&gt; In the state of [[California]], there are an estimated 25,000-35,000 American black bears, making it the largest population of the species in the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tahoewildbears.org/black_bear_facts.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809012840/http://www.tahoewildbears.org/black_bear_facts.htm |archive-date=August 9, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Mammals/Black-Bear/Population| title=Black Bear Population Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1993, known Mexican black bear populations existed in four areas, though knowledge on the distribution of populations outside those areas has not been updated since 1959.

== Habitat ==
Throughout their range, habitats preferred by American black bears have a few shared characteristics. They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material (especially [[Mast (botany)|masts]]). The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been due to the American black bear having evolved alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct giant [[short-faced bear]] and the still-living [[grizzly bear]], that monopolized more open habitats&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lariviere, S. |year=2001 |title= ''Ursus americanus'' |journal= Mammalian Species |volume= 647 |pages= 1–11 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html |doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2001)647&lt;0001:UA&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the historic presence of larger predators, such as ''[[Smilodon]]'' and the [[American lion]], that could have preyed on American black bears. Although found in the largest numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, American black bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in [[Peri-urbanisation|peri-urban]] regions, as long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}

In most of the contiguous United States, American black bears today are usually found in heavily vegetated mountainous areas, from {{convert|400|to|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation. For American black bears living in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and [[Mexico]], habitat usually consists of stands of [[chaparral]] and [[Pinyon-juniper woodland|pinyon juniper woods]]. In this region, bears occasionally move to more open areas to feed on [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]]. At least two distinct, prime habitat types are inhabited in the [[Southeastern United States]]. American black bears in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] survive in predominantly [[oak–hickory forest|oak-hickory]] and mixed [[Mesophyte|mesophytic]] forests. In the coastal areas of the Southeast (such as [[Florida]], [[the Carolinas]] and [[Louisiana]]), bears inhabit a mixture of [[flatwoods]], [[bay]]s and swampy hardwood sites.

In the northeast part of the range (United States and Canada), prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of [[hardwood]]s such as [[beech]], [[maple]], [[birch]] and [[conifer]]ous species. [[Maize|Corn]] crops and oak-hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the Northeast; small, thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]]. Along the Pacific coast, [[redwood]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] and [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] predominate as overstory cover. Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for American black bears, such as fields of brush, wet and dry [[meadow]]s, high [[tideland]]s, [[Riparian zone|riparian areas]] and a variety of mast-producing hardwood species. The [[Spruce|spruce-fir]] forest dominates much of the range of the American black bear in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. Important nonforested areas here are wet meadows, riparian areas, avalanche chutes, roadsides, burns, sidehill parks and [[montane ecosystems|subalpine ridgetops]].

In areas where human development is relatively low, such as stretches of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], American black bears tend to be found more regularly in lowland regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; In parts of northeastern Canada, especially [[Labrador]], American black bears have adapted exclusively to semi-open areas that are more typical habitat in North America for brown bears (likely due to the absence here of brown and polar bears, as well as other large carnivore species).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}

Their claws are typically black or grayish-brown. The claws are short and rounded, being thick at the base and tapering to a point. Claws from both hind and front legs are almost identical in length, though the foreclaws tend to be more sharply curved. The paws of the species are relatively large, with a rear foot length of {{convert|13.7|to|22.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, which is proportionately larger than other medium-sized bear species, but much smaller than the paws of large adult brown, and especially polar, bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} The soles of the feet are black or brownish and are naked, leathery and deeply wrinkled.

The ears are small and rounded and are set well back on the head.

American black bears are highly [[Fine motor skill|dexterous]], being capable of opening screw-top jars and manipulating door latches. They also have great physical strength. They have been known to turn over flat-shaped rocks weighing {{convert|310|to|325|lb|kg}} by flipping them over with a single foreleg.{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Bear Anatomy and Physiology&quot;}} They move in a rhythmic, [[sure-footed]] way and can run at speeds of {{convert|25|to|30|mph}}.{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Behaviour and Activities&quot;}} American black bears have good eyesight and have been proven experimentally to be able to learn visual color discrimination tasks faster than [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and just as fast as domestic [[dog]]s.

American black bear weight tends to vary according to age, sex, health and season. Seasonal variation in weight is very pronounced: in autumn, their pre-den weight tends to be 30% higher than in spring, when black bears emerge from their dens. American black bears on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tend to be heavier on average than those on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], although American black bears follow [[Bergmann's rule]] and bears from the Northwest are often slightly heavier than the bears from the Southeast.

Individual coat colors can range from white, blonde, cinnamon, light brown or dark chocolate brown to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Silvery-gray American black bears with a blue luster (this is found mostly on the flanks) occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia.

American black bears have better eyesight and hearing than humans. Their keenest sense is their sense of smell, which is about seven times more sensitive than a domestic dog's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Black Bear Biology &amp; Behavior| url=http://westernwildlife.org/black-bear-outreach-project/biology-behavior-3/| access-date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, swimming for pleasure and to feed (largely on [[fish]]). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies and hibernate. Four of the eight modern bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age.{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Behaviour and Activities&quot;}} They may be active at any time of the day or night, although they mainly forage by night. American black bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively [[nocturnal]], while those living near brown bears tend to be more often [[Diurnality|diurnal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt;

American black bears tend to be [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and non-[[social animal|gregarious]] in nature. However, at abundant food sources (e.g. spawning [[salmon]] or [[Landfill|garbage dump]]s), they may congregate and dominance hierarchies form, with the largest, most powerful males dominating the most fruitful feeding spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot;&gt;Nowak, R. M. (1991) ''Walker's Mammals of the World''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} They [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|mark their territories]] by rubbing their bodies against trees and clawing at the bark. Annual ranges held by mature male American black bears tend to be very large, though there is some variation. On [[Long Island (Washington)|Long Island]] off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], ranges average {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, whereas on the [[Ungava Peninsula]] in [[Canada]] ranges can average up to {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, with some male bears traveling as far as {{convert|4349|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} at times of food shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}

American black bears may communicate with various vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking and grunting are the most common sounds and are made in cordial situations to conspecifics, offspring and occasionally humans. During times of fear or nervousness, bears may moan, huff or blow air. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping. In aggressive interactions, American black bears produce deep-throated pulsing sounds. Cubs may squeal, bawl or scream when in distress and make a motor-like humming sound when comfortable or nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=North American Bear Center |url=https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/communication/29-vocalizations-a-body-language.html |title=Vocalizations &amp; Body Language |access-date=2016-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223132123/https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/communication/29-vocalizations-a-body-language.html |archive-date=December 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Masterson, Linda |year=2016 |title=Living With Bears Handbook: Expanded 2nd Edition |publisher=PixyJack Press |pages=215–16 |isbn=978-1936555611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Naughton, Donna |year=2014 |title=The Natural History of Canadian Mammals: Opossums and Carnivores |publisher=University of Toronto Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_CeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT218&amp;q=black%20bear%20pulsing%20sound|isbn=9781442622319}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;&gt;{{cite iucn| author=Garshelis, D.L.| author2=Crider, D.| author3=van Manen, F.| name-list-style=amp| year=2008| url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41687/0| title=''Ursus americanus''| access-date=January 27, 2009|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and development ===
Sows usually produce their first litter at the age of three to five years,{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Behaviour and Activities&quot;}} with those living in more developed areas tending to get pregnant at younger ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;life&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080930135301.htm |title=Urban Black Bears &quot;Live Fast, Die Young&quot; |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=October 1, 2008 |access-date=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breeding period usually occurs in the June–July period, though it can extend to August in the species' northern range. The breeding period lasts for two to three months. Both sexes are [[promiscuous]]. Males try to mate with several females, but large, dominant ones may violently claim a female if another mature male comes near.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; Sows tend to be short-tempered with their mates after copulating. The fertilized eggs undergo delayed development and do not implant in the female's womb until November. The gestation period lasts 235&amp;nbsp;days and litters are usually born in late January to early February. Litter size is between one and six cubs, typically two or three.&lt;ref name=&quot;North American Bear Center – Reproduction&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Reproduction |url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/reproduction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217155959/http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/reproduction.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-12-17 |publisher=North American Bear Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; At birth, cubs weigh {{convert|280|–|450|g|lb|abbr=on}} and measure {{convert|20.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. They are born with fine, gray, down-like hair and their hind quarters are underdeveloped. They typically open their eyes after 28–40&amp;nbsp;days and begin walking after five weeks. Cubs are dependent on their mother's milk for 30&amp;nbsp;weeks and will reach independence at 16–18&amp;nbsp;months. At the age of six weeks, they attain {{convert|900|g|lb|abbr=on}}, by the age of eight weeks they reach {{convert|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and by the age of six months they weigh {{convert|18|to|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They reach sexual maturity at the age of three years and attain their full growth at the age of five years.{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Behaviour and Activities&quot;}}

=== Longevity and mortality ===
[[File:Ursus americanus PO 4.ogv|thumb|A female with cubs in [[Parc Omega]], [[Quebec]]]]

The average lifespan in the wild is 18&amp;nbsp;years, though it is quite possible for wild specimens to survive for more than 23 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macdonald&quot; /&gt; The record age of a wild specimen was 39&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://news.dnr.state.mn.us/2013/08/27/world%E2%80%99s-oldest-known-wild-black-bear-dies-at-39/ |title=World's oldest-known wild black bear dies at 39 |agency=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |date=August 27, 2013 |access-date=2016-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053538/http://news.dnr.state.mn.us/2013/08/27/world%E2%80%99s-oldest-known-wild-black-bear-dies-at-39/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; while that in captivity was 44&amp;nbsp;years.{{sfn|Brown|1993|loc=Ch. &quot;Bear Anatomy and Physiology&quot;}} The average annual survival rate for adult American black bears is variable, ranging from 86% in [[Florida]] to 73% in [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; In [[Minnesota]], 99% of wintering adult bears were able to survive the hibernation cycle in one study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; Remarkably, a study of American black bears in [[Nevada]] found that the amount of annual mortality of a population of bears in wilderness areas was 0%, whereas in developed areas in the state this figure rose to 83%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} Survival in subadults is generally less assured. In [[Alaska]], only 14–17% of subadult males and 30–48% of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; Across the range, the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}

With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult [[brown bear]] or a [[Wolf|gray wolf]] pack, adult American black bears are not usually subject to natural predation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, American black bears may occasionally have fallen, and still do fall, prey to [[North American jaguar|jaguar]]s in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite to the back of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/return-great-american-jaguar-180960443/ |title=The Return of the Great American Jaguar |last=Grant |first=Richard |website=Smithsonian Magazine |date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; American black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[North American cougar|cougar]]s, gray wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; Many of these will stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a [[golden eagle]] snatching a yearling cub.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt; Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2012/03/29/bear-saves-hiker-from-cougar-in-butte-county/ &quot;Man Says Bear Saved Him from Mountain Lion Attack in Butte County&quot;]. KOVR. (March 29, 2012). Retrieved 2012-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bear fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of American black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto collisions also may claim many American black bear lives annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Lariviere&quot; /&gt;

=== Hibernation ===
[[File:Bear hibernating.jpg|right|thumb|A female and cubs hibernating]]

American black bears were once not considered true or &quot;deep&quot; [[hibernators]], but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow American black bears to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as &quot;specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather&quot;. American black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/black-bear-facts/hibernation.html |title=Hibernation |publisher=Bear.org |date=July 19, 2004 |access-date=February 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608193610/http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/black-bear-facts/hibernation.html |archive-date=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/denning.htm |title=Yellowstone National Park – Denning and Hibernation Behavior |publisher=[[U.S. National Park Service]] |date=April 15, 2008 |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear's success in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=McCain |first1=Stephanie |last2=Ramsay |first2=Ed |last3=Kirk |first3=Claudia |s2cid=21582518 |date=2013-06-01 |title=The effects of hibernation and captivity on glucose metabolism and thyroid hormones in American black bear (''Ursus americanus'') |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine|volume=44 |issue=#2 |pages=324–332 |doi=10.1638/2012-0146R1.1 |issn=1042-7260 |pmid=23805551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bears enter their dens in October and November, although in the southernmost areas of their range (i.e. Florida, Mexico, the [[Southeastern United States]]), only pregnant females and mothers with yearling cubs will enter hibernation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2020}} Prior to that time, they can put on up to {{convert|30|lb|order=flip|abbr=on}} of body fat to get them through the several months during which they fast. Hibernation in American black bears typically lasts 3–8&amp;nbsp;months, depending on regional climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;charlotte&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Michigan |first=Department of Natural Resources |title=Michigan Black Bear Facts |publisher=State of Michigan |date=19 November 2004 |url=http://michigan.gov/dnr/0%2C1607%2C7-153-10369-105034--%2C00.html |access-date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

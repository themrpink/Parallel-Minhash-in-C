It must be emphasized,{{why|date=October 2016}} however, that an entity is not ''merely'' a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, [[creativity]] is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an [[electron]]) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by [[Causation (law)|causal]] or [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Most entities do not have [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_c&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow.  Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], &quot;Freedom Requires Indeterminism and Universal Causality&quot;, ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 55 (1958): 794.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations); each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_b&quot; /&gt; Freedom always exists within limits.  But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John B. Cobb]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1978), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favor of the idea of reality as interrelated events in process.  He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic &quot;becoming&quot; rather than static &quot;being,&quot; emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve, and that changeless &quot;essences&quot; such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth&quot;/&gt;

===Theory of perception===
Since Whitehead's [[metaphysics]] described a universe in which all entities [[Experience#Subjective experience|experience]], he needed a new way of describing [[perception]] that was not limited to living, [[self-conscious]] beings.  The term he coined was &quot;prehension,&quot; which comes from the Latin ''prehensio'', meaning &quot;to seize&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot;&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as [[electron]]s.  It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of ''representative'' perception, in which the [[mind]] only has private ideas about other entities.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot; /&gt; For Whitehead, the term &quot;prehension&quot; indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidRay&quot; /&gt; In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.  Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, ''causal efficacy'' (or &quot;physical prehension&quot;) and ''presentational immediacy'' (or &quot;conceptual prehension&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_c&quot; /&gt;

Whitehead describes causal efficacy as &quot;the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, in other words, the sense of [[causal]] relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the [[sense]]s.  Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as &quot;pure sense perception,&quot; unmediated by any causal or [[symbol]]ic [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], even [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] interpretation.  In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e.g., mistaking an image in a mirror for &quot;the real thing&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms &quot;symbolic reference,&quot; which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it.  By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair.  An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair.  However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, &quot;might not have jumped to the notion of a chair,&quot; but instead &quot;might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it.  Moreover, animals do the same thing.  Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog &quot;would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and value===
Whitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about [[Teleology|value and purpose]] can never be fully escaped.  This is borne out in his thoughts on [[abiogenesis]], or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds.

Whitehead makes the startling observation that &quot;life is comparatively deficient in survival value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, &quot;they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction.  Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.

For Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert [[matter]].  Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or [[creativity]], however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed. The [[process philosophy|process philosopher]] [[David Ray Griffin]] coined the term &quot;[[Panexperientialism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]&quot; (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from [[panpsychism]] (the idea that all matter has [[consciousness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead's idea of [[God]] differs from traditional monotheistic notions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapters 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his most famous and pointed [[Criticism of Christianity|criticism of the Christian conception of God]] is that &quot;the Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to [[Caesar]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Whitehead is criticizing Christianity for defining [[Theocracy|God as primarily a divine king]] who imposes his will on the world, and whose most important attribute is power. As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called &quot;the brief Galilean vision of humility&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operates by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world. Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also it is a little oblivious as to [[morals]]. It does not look to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_e&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For Whitehead, God is not necessarily tied to [[religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_d&quot;&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than springing primarily from religious [[faith]], Whitehead saw God as necessary for his [[metaphysical]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_d&quot; /&gt; His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities. Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the ''primordial nature'' of God. However, Whitehead was also interested in [[religious experience]]. This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the ''consequent nature''. Whitehead's conception of God as a &quot;dipolar&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 345.&lt;/ref&gt; entity has called for fresh [[theological]] thinking.

The primordial nature he described as &quot;the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_e&quot; /&gt; — i.e., the unlimited possibility of the universe.  This primordial nature is [[Eternity|eternal]] and [[Immutability (theology)|unchanging]], providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization.  Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect &quot;the lure for [[feeling]], the eternal urge of desire,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities.

God's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging; it is God's reception of the world's activity.  As Whitehead puts it, &quot;[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life.  It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 346.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world.  In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.

Whitehead thus sees [[Panentheism|God and the world as fulfilling one another]]. He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time.  On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them.  God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change.  Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom.'  The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of [[antitheses]], whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence. In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast.

&quot;It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.

&quot;It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.

&quot;It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.

&quot;It is as true to say that the World is [[immanent]] in God, as that God is immanent in the World.

&quot;It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.

&quot;It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God...

&quot;What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world... In this sense, God is the great companion – the fellow-sufferer who understands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 347–348, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as [[process theology]], a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce&quot;&gt;[[Bruce G. Epperly]], ''Process Theology: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (New York: T&amp;T Clark, 2011), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
For Whitehead, the core of religion was individual.  While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous remark on religion is that &quot;religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's [[Character structure|character]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not ''necessarily'' good – an idea which he called a &quot;dangerous delusion&quot; (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while Whitehead saw religion as ''beginning'' in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual.  In keeping with his [[Process philosophy#Process metaphysics|process metaphysics]] in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of &quot;the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others; meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community.  Whitehead writes further that each entity &quot;can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe.  Religion is world-loyalty.  The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.

Whitehead also described religion more technically as &quot;an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of [[emotion]] that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance.  For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.

==Influence==
[[Isabelle Stengers]] wrote that &quot;Whiteheadians are recruited among both [[philosopher]]s and theologians, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from [[ecology]] to [[feminism]], practices that unite political struggle and [[spirituality]] with the [[Pedagogy|sciences of education]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IsabelleStengers&quot; /&gt; In recent decades, attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology.  One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]]. In Temple's [[Gifford Lectures]] of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as &quot;Nature, Man and God&quot;), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the [[emergent evolution]] approach with which Temple interacts.&lt;ref&gt;George Garin, &quot;Theistic Evolution in a Sacramental Universe: The Theology of William Temple Against the Background of Process Thinkers (Whitehead, Alexander, Etc.),&quot; (Protestant University Press, Kinshasa, The Congo, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.

Early followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], where [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;GaryDorrien_a&quot; /&gt; Professors such as Wieman, [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Bernard Loomer]], Bernard Meland, and [[Daniel Day Williams]] made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], &quot;The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology&quot;, ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of whom is [[John B. Cobb]].

Although interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's divinity school, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in [[Claremont, California]], where he began teaching at [[Claremont School of Theology]] in 1958 and founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], &quot;[[John B. Cobb]], Jr.: A Theological Biography&quot;, in ''Theology and the University: Essays in Honor of John B. Cobb, Jr.'', ed. David Ray Griffin and Joseph C. Hough, Jr. (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], &quot;The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology&quot;, ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_e&quot;&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China.  In order to address the challenges of [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]], China has begun to blend traditions of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]] with Whitehead's &quot;constructive post-modern&quot; philosophy in order to create an &quot;ecological civilization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.vancouversun&quot;&gt;&quot;China embraces Alfred North Whitehead&quot;, last modified 10 December 2008, Douglas Todd, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', accessed 5 December 2013, http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2008/12/10/china-embraces-alfred-north-whitehead/.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centres for the study of Whitehead's philosophy,&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.vancouversun&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |publisher=The Institute for the Postmodern Development of China |access-date=21 November 2013 |url=http://www.postmodernchina.org/cgi/aboutUs.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230254/http://www.postmodernchina.org/cgi/aboutUs.html |archive-date=2 December 2013 |website=www.postmodernchina.org |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.vancouversun&quot; /&gt; Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.vancouversun&quot; /&gt;

Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize.  In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal [[graduate school|graduate-level]] theology and philosophy programs.  Outside of these circles, his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whitehead, Alfred North&quot;, last modified 8 May 2007, Gary L. Herstein, ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', accessed 20 July 2015, http://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of [[Bertrand Russell]], and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quine Biography&quot;, last modified October 2003, John J.

Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James, eds., ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the [[Continental philosophy|continental tradition]], such as French [[post-structuralist]] philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]], who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that &quot;he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GillesDeleuze&quot;&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]], ''The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque'', trans. Tom Conley (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993), 76.&lt;/ref&gt; French [[sociologist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]] even went so far as to call Whitehead &quot;the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BrunoLatour&quot;&gt;[[Bruno Latour]], preface to ''Thinking with Whitehead: A Free and Wild Creation of Concepts'', by [[Isabelle Stengers]], trans. Michael Chase (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011), x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alfred North Whitehead&quot;, last modified 10 March 2015, Andrew David Irvine, ed.

===Process philosophy and theology===
[[Image:Nicholas Rescher 2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]. Rescher is a proponent of both Whiteheadian [[process philosophy]] and American [[pragmatism]].]]
Historically, Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of [[Americans|American]] [[Progressive Christianity|progressive theology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_e&quot; /&gt; The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a [[theological]] context was [[Charles Hartshorne]], who spent a semester at [[Harvard]] as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's [[process philosophy]] into a full-blown [[process theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'', 2nd edition (Louisville, Westminster John Knox Press, 2007), 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable process theologians include [[John B. Cobb]], [[David Ray Griffin]], [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]], [[C. Robert Mesle]], [[Roland Faber]], and [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]].

Process theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as [[impassibility|impassive]] or emotionless, process theologians view God as &quot;the fellow sufferer who understands,&quot; and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 351.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praiseworthy quality in God?&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world.  However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways.  C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a &quot;process [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&quot; — i.e., a process theology without God.&lt;ref&gt;See part IV of [[C. Robert Mesle|Mesle]]'s ''Process Theology: A Basic Introduction'' (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] in their views and interests. John B. Cobb is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with [[poststructuralist]], [[postcolonialist]], and [[feminist]] theory. [[Charles Birch]] was both a theologian and a [[geneticist]]. [[Franklin I. Gamwell]] writes on theology and political theory. In ''Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age'', futurologists [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the [[participatory culture]] expected to dominate the digital era.

Process philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume [[State University of New York]] series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian [[David Ray Griffin]] displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Search Results For: SUNY series in Constructive Postmodern Thought&quot;, Sunypress.edu, accessed 5 December 2013, http://www.sunypress.edu/Searchadv.aspx?IsSubmit=true&amp;CategoryID=6899.&lt;/ref&gt;

One philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American [[pragmatism]]. Whitehead himself thought highly of [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredNorth_f&quot; /&gt; Charles Hartshorne (along with [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]]) edited the collected papers of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], one of the founders of pragmatism.  Noted [[neopragmatist]] [[Richard Rorty]] was in turn a student of Hartshorne.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Richard Rorty&quot;, last modified 16 June 2007, Bjørn Ramberg, ed. Edward N. Zalta, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2009 Edition), accessed 5 December 2013, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/rorty/.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Nicholas Rescher]] is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism.

In addition, while they might not properly be called process philosophers, Whitehead has been influential in the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Milič Čapek]], [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Susanne Langer]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Science===
[[Image:David Bohm.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[theoretical physics|Theoretical physicist]] [[David Bohm]]. Bohm is one example of a scientist influenced by Whitehead's philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeDavid&quot;&gt;See [[David Ray Griffin]], ''Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Scientists of the early 20th century for whom Whitehead's work has been influential include physical chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], biologist [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], and geneticists [[Charles Birch]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birch&quot;&gt;[[Charles Birch]], &quot;Why Aren't We Zombies? Neo-Darwinism and Process Thought&quot;, in ''Back to Darwin: A Richer Account of Evolution'', ed. John B. Cobb Jr. (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2008), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Henry Murray]] dedicated his &quot;Explorations in Personality&quot; to Whitehead, a contemporary at Harvard.

In physics, [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation]] articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. It has been severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] (1979). Einstein and general relativity, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''47''': 212–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Martin Will|Will, C.M.]] (1981/1993). ''Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics'', revised edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{isbn|978-0-521-43973-2}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Yutaka Tanaka suggested that the [[gravitational constant]] disagrees with experimental findings, and proposed that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Tanaka, &quot;The Comparison between Whitehead's and Einstein's Theories of Relativity&quot;, ''Historia Scientiarum'' 32 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of [[gravitational waves]], phenomena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], his [[metaphysics]] of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field. [[Henry Stapp]] and [[David Bohm]] are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeeDavid&quot; /&gt;

In the 21st century, Whiteheadian thought is still a stimulating influence: [[Timothy E. Eastman]] and Hank Keeton's ''Physics and Whitehead'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Timothy E. Eastman and Hank Keeton, eds., ''Physics and Whitehead: Quantum, Process, and Experience'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Epperson's ''Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Epperson, ''Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature'' (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Epperson &amp; Elias Zafiris, ''Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature'' (New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; aim to offer Whiteheadian approaches to [[physics]]. Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and [[Dorion Sagan]]'s ''Beyond Mechanism'' (2013) and [[Rupert Sheldrake]]'s ''Science Set Free'' (2012) are examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology.

===Ecology, economy, and sustainability===
[[Image:John B. Cobb Jr.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Theologian, philosopher, and environmentalist [[John B. Cobb]] founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] in [[Claremont, California]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973, and is often regarded as the preeminent scholar in the field of [[process philosophy]] and [[process theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process Theology'' (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1993), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], &quot;The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology&quot;, ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Coleman]], [[Nancy R. Howell]], and Helene Tallon Russell, ''Creating Women's Theology: A Movement Engaging Process Thought'' (Wipf and Stock, 2011), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of [[ecology|ecological]] civilization, [[sustainability]], and [[environmental ethics]].

&quot;Because Whitehead's holistic [[metaphysics]] of value lends itself so readily to an ecological point of view, many see his work as a promising alternative to the traditional [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview, providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipRose&quot; /&gt;

This work has been pioneered by [[John B. Cobb]], whose book ''Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology'' (1971) was the first single-authored book in environmental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Environmental Ethics for the Novice&quot;, last modified 15 March 2011, The Center for Environmental Philosophy, accessed 21 November 2013, http://www.cep.unt.edu/novice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb also co-authored a book with leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] entitled ''For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future'' (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to [[economics]], and received the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (1994), which aimed to challenge &quot;economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John B. Cobb Jr., ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 1994), back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Whitehead is widely known for his influence in [[education theory]]. His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled ''Process Papers'' on [[process philosophy]] and education from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Process Papers'', a publication of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education.  Volume 1 published in 1996, Volume 11 (final volume) published in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching.

One such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C. Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems.  As Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard put it: &quot;Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard, &quot;The Philosophy of the ANISA Model&quot;, ''Process Papers'' 6, 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

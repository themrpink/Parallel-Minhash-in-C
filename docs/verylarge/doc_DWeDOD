The origins of the terms ''[[Hip (slang)|hip]]'' and ''hep'' are uncertain.

popularized hippie culture, leading to the [[Summer of Love]] on the West Coast of the United States, and the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as ''[[jipitecas]]'', formed ''[[La Onda]]'' and gathered at [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]], while in New Zealand, nomadic [[housetrucker]]s practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at [[Nambassa]]. In the United Kingdom in 1970, many gathered at the gigantic [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] with a crowd of around 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The attendance at the third Pop Festival at...Isle of Wight, England on 30 Aug 1970 was claimed by its promoters, Fiery Creations, to be 400,000.&quot; ''The Guinness book of Records, 1987'' (p. 91), Russell, Alan (ed.).

In Australia, hippies gathered at [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]] for the 1973 [[Aquarius Festival]] and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or [[MardiGrass]]. &quot;[[Piedra Roja|''Piedra Roja'' Festival]]&quot;, a major hippie event in Chile, was held in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Fernando|title=Ampliando miradas: Chile y su historia en un tiempo global|year=2009|publisher=RIL Editores|isbn=978-956-284-701-8|author2=Alfredo Riquelme|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippie and psychedelic culture influenced 1960s and early 1970s youth culture in [[Iron Curtain]] countries in Eastern Europe (see ''[[Mánička]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1347632.html|title=(Un)Civil Societies: September 3, 2007|website=Rferl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippie fashion and values had a major effect on culture, influencing [[popular music]], television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, mainstream society has assimilated many aspects of hippie culture. The religious and [[cultural diversity]] the hippies espoused has gained widespread acceptance, and their pop versions of [[Eastern philosophy]] and Asian spiritual concepts have reached a larger group.

[[Lexicography|Lexicographer]] [[Jesse Sheidlower]], the principal American editor of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', argues that the terms ''hipster'' and ''hippie'' derive from the word ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'', whose origins are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''hip'' in the sense of &quot;aware, in the know&quot; is first attested in a 1902 cartoon by [[Tad Dorgan]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lighter, ''Random House Dictionary of Historical Slang''&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in prose in a 1904 novel by [[George Vere Hobart]]&lt;ref&gt;George Vere Hobart (January 16, 1867 – January 31, 1926)&lt;/ref&gt; (1867–1926), ''Jim Hickey: A Story of the One-Night Stands'', where an African-American character uses the slang phrase &quot;Are you hip?&quot;

The term ''hipster'' was coined by [[Harry Gibson]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry The Hipster Gibson 1986&quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, the terms ''hip'', ''hep'' and ''hepcat'' were popular in [[Harlem]] [[jazz]] slang, although ''hep'' eventually came to denote an inferior status to ''hip''.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gibson wrote: ''&quot;At that time musicians used jive talk among themselves and many customers were picking up on it. One of these words was ''hep'' which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using ''hep'', musicians changed to ''hip''. I started calling people ''hipsters'' and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.' Musicians at the club began calling me ''Harry the Hipster''; so I wrote a new tune called 'Handsome Harry the Hipster.'&quot;'' -- &quot;Everybody's Crazy But Me&quot; (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenwich Village]] in the early 1960s, [[New York City]], young [[counterculture]] advocates were named ''hips'' because they were considered &quot;in the know&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;, as opposed to being ''[[Square (slang)|square]]'', meaning conventional and old-fashioned. In the April 27, 1961 issue of [[The Village Voice]], &quot;An open letter to JFK &amp; Fidel Castro&quot;, Norman Mailer utilizes the term hippies, in questioning JFK's behavior.  In a 1961 essay, [[Kenneth Rexroth]] used both the terms ''hipster'' and ''hippies'' to refer to young people participating in black American or [[Beatnik]] nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;Rexroth, Kenneth. (1961). &quot;[http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/jazz2.htm What's Wrong with the Clubs].&quot; ''Metronome''. Reprinted in ''Assays''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Malcolm X]]'s 1964 autobiography, the word ''hippie'' in 1940s Harlem had been used to describe a [[wigger|specific type of white man]] who &quot;acted more [[Negro]] than Negroes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Martin (2004), ''Cannabis: A History, St. Martin's Press'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] refers to &quot;all the Chicago hippies,&quot; seemingly in reference to black blues/R&amp;B musicians, in his rear [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] to the 1965 LP ''[[The Rolling Stones, Now!]]''

The word hippie was also used in reference to Philadelphia in at least two popular songs in 1963: [[South Street (song)|South Street]] by [[The Orlons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/the-orlons/south-street-lyrics/|title=South Street - The Orlons|website=SongLyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[You Can't Sit Down]] by [[The Dovells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/dovells/you-can-t-sit-down-lyrics/|title=You Can't Sit Down - Dovells|website=SongLyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both songs, the term is applied to residents of Philadelphia's [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]].

Although the word ''hippies'' made other isolated appearances in print during the early 1960s, the first use of the term on the West Coast appeared in the article &quot;A New Paradise for [[Beatniks]]&quot; (in the ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]]'', issue of September 5, 1965) by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn Cafe ([[coffeehouse]]) (located at 1927 Hayes Street in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco), using the term ''hippie'' to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] into the [[Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California|Haight-Ashbury]] district.&lt;ref name=pc42&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19801/m1/ |title=Show 42 - The Acid Test: Defining 'hippy' |show=42 |track=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; did not become widespread in the [[mass media]] until early 1967, after ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' [[columnist]] [[Herb Caen]] began to use the term; See &quot;Take a Hippie to Lunch Today&quot;, S.F.

[[File:Hippie bug! (1043753793).jpg|thumb|left|A hippie-painted [[Volkswagen Beetle]]]]
A July 1968 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] study on hippie philosophy credited the foundation of the hippie movement with historical precedent as far back as the [[sadhu]] of India, the spiritual seekers who had renounced the world and materialistic pursuits by taking &quot;[[Sannyas]]&quot;. Even the counterculture of the Ancient Greeks, espoused by philosophers like [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynics]] were also early forms of hippie culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time_1968&quot;&gt;{{Citation

The first signs of modern &quot;proto-hippies&quot; emerged in [[fin de siècle]], turn of the century Europe. Late 1890s to early 1900s, a German youth movement arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered around &quot;German folk music&quot;. Known as ''[[Wandervogel|Der Wandervogel]]'' (&quot;wandering bird&quot;), the hippie movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing folk music and singing, creative dress, and outdoor life involving hiking and camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some opened the first [[health food store]]s, and many moved to [[southern California]] where they introduced an alternative lifestyle. One group, called the &quot;Nature Boys&quot;, took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel.&lt;ref name=LAT081004&gt;Elaine Woo, [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/10/local/me-boots10 Gypsy Boots, 89; Colorful Promoter of Healthy Food and Lifestyles], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 10, 2004, Accessed December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter [[eden ahbez]] wrote a hit song called ''[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]'' inspired by Robert Bootzin ([[Gypsy Boots]]), who helped popularize health-consciousness, [[yoga]], and [[organic food]] in the United States.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, novelist [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] lived communally in California. Members included Beat Generation hero [[Neal Cassady]], [[Ken Babbs]], [[Carolyn Garcia|Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl/Carolyn Garcia)]], [[Stewart Brand]], [[Del Close]], [[Paul Foster (cartoonist)|Paul Foster]], [[Merry Pranksters|George Walker]], Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and others. Their early escapades were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''. With Cassady at the wheel of a school bus named [[Further (bus)|Further]], the Merry Pranksters traveled across the United States to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' and to visit the 1964 [[World's Fair]] in New York City. The Merry Pranksters were known for using [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[amphetamine]], and [[LSD]], and during their journey they &quot;turned on&quot; many people to these [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]]. The Merry Pranksters filmed and audio taped their bus trips, creating an immersive [[multimedia]] experience that would later be presented to the public in the form of festivals and concerts. The [[Grateful Dead]] wrote a song about the Merry Pranksters' bus trips called &quot;That's It for the Other One&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodd 1998&quot;/&gt; In 1961, [[Vito Paulekas]] and his wife Szou established in [[Hollywood]] a clothing boutique which was credited with being one of the first to introduce &quot;hippie&quot; fashions.&lt;ref name=scram&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621124240/http://www.scrammagazine.com/franzoni] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rogan&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLCw5BbrTwkC&amp;q=%22vito+paulekas%22&amp;pg=PA66|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited : the Sequel|first=Johnny|last=Rogan|page=66|date=August 31, 1997|publisher=Rogan House|via=Google Books|isbn=9780952954019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYbZZUAOpdAC&amp;q=%22vito+paulekas%22&amp;pg=PA14|title=Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-and-Roll's Legendary Neighborhood|first=Michael|last=Walker|page=14|date=May 1, 2010|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429932936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1966, the Family Dog became Family Dog Productions under organizer [[Chet Helms]], promoting happenings at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] and the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] in initial cooperation with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience.

Caen determined that, &quot;Except in their music, they couldn't care less about the approval of the straight world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Caen/&gt; Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture.&lt;ref name=Caen&gt;SFGate.com.

Retrieved on June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured a cover story entitled, &quot;The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture.&quot; The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: &quot;Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach.

The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the &quot;hippie&quot; label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===1967–1969: Revolution and peak of influence===
[[File:August 25, 1968, Hippies in Lincoln Park, Chicago.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=0:45|Anti-war protesters in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]], attending a [[Yippie]] organized event, approximately five miles north of the [[1968 Democratic National convention]]. The band [[MC5]] can be seen playing.]]
By 1968, hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous [[baby boomer]] generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and also longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art, and literature, and not just in the US, but around the world. [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to &quot;get clean for Gene&quot; by shaving their beards or wearing longer skirts; however the &quot;Clean Genes&quot; had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippy adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.

A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. [[Hippie exploitation films]] are 1960s [[exploitation films]] about the hippie counterculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesocietyofthespectacle.com/2009/04/mondo-mod-worlds-of-hippie-revolt-and-other-weirdness/ |title=Mondo Mod Worlds Of Hippie Revolt (And Other Weirdness) |website=Thesocietyofthespectacle.com |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112091111/http://thesocietyofthespectacle.com/2009/04/mondo-mod-worlds-of-hippie-revolt-and-other-weirdness/ |archive-date=November 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[LSD]] use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. Examples include ''[[The Love-ins]]'', ''[[Psych-Out]]'', ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'', and ''[[Wild in the Streets]]''. Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''. (See also: [[List of films related to the hippie subculture]].) Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as [[List of books and publications related to the hippie subculture|fiction and nonfiction books]]. The popular Broadway musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' was presented in 1967.

People commonly label other cultural movements of that period as hippie, however there are differences. For example, hippies were often not directly engaged in politics, as contrasted with &quot;Yippies&quot; (Youth International Party), an activist organization. The [[Yippies]] came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York—eventually resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as &quot;Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!&quot; Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, &quot;[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]&quot; (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html |title=&quot;The Politics of Yip&quot;, ''TIME Magazine'', Apr. 5, 1968 |website=Time.com |date=April 5, 1968 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cambridge, hippies congregated each Sunday for a large &quot;be-in&quot; at Cambridge Park with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement. In the US the Hippie movement started to be seen as part of the &quot;[[New Left]]&quot; which was associated with anti-war college campus protest movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carmines and Layman&quot; /&gt; The New Left was a term used mainly in the United Kingdom and United States in reference to [[social activism|activists]], [[educator]]s, [[agitators]] and others in the 1960s and 1970s who sought to implement a broad range of reforms on issues such as gay rights, abortion, gender roles and drugs&lt;ref name=&quot;Carmines and Layman&quot;&gt;Carmines, Edward G., and Geoffrey C.

In April 1969, the building of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]] in Berkeley, California received international attention. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] had demolished all the buildings on a {{convert|2.8|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park. A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, when Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the park destroyed, which led to a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the [[California National Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wollenberg&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Wollenberg |first=Charles |title=Berkeley, A City in History |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-520-25307-0 |url=http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter9.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015337/http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter9.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hayward_2001&gt;{{Citation|last=Hayward|first=Steven F.|title=The Age of Reagan, 1964-1980: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order|year=2001|publisher=Prima Publishing|location=Roseville, California|isbn=978-0-7615-1337-7|oclc=47667257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BafgsBIlrwC&amp;pg=PA325|accessdate=January 31, 2011|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flower power]] came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of [[civil disobedience]] to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan &quot;Let a Thousand Parks Bloom&quot;.

In August 1969, the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Fair]] took place in [[Bethel, New York|Bethel]], New York, which for many, exemplified the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Dean|first=Maury|authorlink=Maury Dean |title=Rock 'N' Roll Gold Rush|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2003|page=243|isbn=0-87586-207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hear some of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them [[Canned Heat]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Sly &amp; The Family Stone]], [[The Who]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. [[Wavy Gravy]]'s [[Hog Farm]] provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred in other parts of the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.

In December 1969, a rock festival took place in [[Altamont, California|Altamont]], California, about 45&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles ) east of San Francisco. Initially billed as &quot;Woodstock West&quot;, its official name was [[Altamont Music Festival|The Altamont Free Concert]].

By the 1970s, the 1960s [[zeitgeist]] that had spawned hippie culture seemed to be on the wane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugliosi_1994&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1994|pp=638–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi (1994) describes the popular view that the Manson case &quot;sounded the death knell for hippies and all they symbolically represented&quot;, citing [[Joan Didion]], [[Diane Sawyer]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

Another shock came in the form of the [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]] murders committed in August 1969 by [[Charles Manson]] and his &quot;family&quot; of followers. Nevertheless, the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of Cambodia and shootings by [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] at [[Jackson State killings|Jackson State University]] and [[Kent State shootings|Kent State University]] still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] &quot;What About Me?&quot;, where they sang, &quot;You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down&quot;, as well as [[Neil Young]]'s &quot;[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]&quot;, a song that protested the [[Kent State shootings|Kent State massacre]], recorded by [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]].

Much of hippie style had been integrated into [[mainstream]] American society by the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tompkins_2001a&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tompkins|2001a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morford&quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] and [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and the British [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1968 became the norm, evolving into [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] in the process. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the [[1971 May Day Protests]] as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington, D.C.; President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and chatted with a group of the hippie protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in 1973. During the mid-late 1970s, with the [[Fall of Saigon|end]] of the draft and the [[Vietnam War]], a renewal of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiment associated with the approach of the [[United States Bicentennial]], the decline in popularity of psychedelic rock, and the emergence of new genres such as [[prog rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[disco]], and [[punk rock]], the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture.

The bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the &quot;[[Beat Generation]]&quot; style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Karen 2001 ''Joni Mitchell: Shadows and Light''. London:Virgin Books, pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; The entire tone of the ''new'' subculture was different. Jon McIntire, manager of the Grateful Dead from the late sixties to the mid-eighties, points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of [[joy]]. &quot;The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenfield |first=Robert |format=interview |title=The Burden of Being Jerry |url=http://www.levity.com/gans/SFFocus.html |accessdate=2013-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippies sought to free themselves from societal restrictions, choose their own way, and find new [[meaning of life|meaning in life]]. One expression of hippie independence from societal norms was found in their standard of dress and grooming, which made hippies instantly recognizable to one another, and served as a visual symbol of their respect for individual rights. Through their appearance, hippies declared their willingness to question authority, and distanced themselves from the &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;[[square (slang)|square]]&quot; (i.e., conformist) segments of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yablonsky_1968_243357&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|pp=103 et al.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality traits]] and values that hippies tend to be associated with are &quot;[[altruism]] and [[mysticism]], [[honesty]], [[joy]] and [[nonviolence]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html |title=&quot;The Hippies&quot; in Time magazine |website=Time.com |date=July 7, 1967 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many thoughtful hippies distanced themselves from the very idea that the way a person dresses could be a reliable signal of who he or she was—especially after outright criminals such as [[Charles Manson]] began to adopt superficial hippie characteristics, and also after plainclothes policemen started to &quot;dress like hippies&quot; to [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] legitimate members of the counterculture. [[Frank Zappa]], known for lampooning hippie ethos, particularly with songs like &quot;[[Who Needs the Peace Corps?]]&quot; (1968), admonished his audience that &quot;we all wear a uniform&quot;. The San Francisco clown/hippie [[Wavy Gravy]] said in 1987 that he could still see fellow-feeling in the eyes of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] businessmen who had dressed conventionally to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Leading proponents of the 1960s Psychedelic Art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]]. Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. Posters for concerts in the [[Fillmore West]], a concert auditorium in San Francisco, popular with Hippie audiences, were among the most notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely &quot;trippy&quot; atmosphere for the audience.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Libraries, archives and galleries===
{{main|Concordia University Library}}
Concordia University has three main library locations. The R. Howard Webster Library is located in the J.W. McConnell Building on the Sir George Williams Campus and the Georges P. Vanier Library is located on the Loyola Campus. On September 2, 2014, the Library opened the Grey Nuns Reading Room, a silent study space for Concordia students located in the former Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross. The Concordia Library houses several special and unique collections including the Azrieli Holocaust Collection and the Irving Layton Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Collections|url=http://library.concordia.ca/find/special-collections/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most special collections are located in the Vanier Library.

===New buildings===
In 2001, Concordia embarked on a mission to develop and expand the quality of the downtown campus, and to revive the west end in Montreal.

The university also acquired the historic [[Grey Nuns]] [[motherhouse]] near its Sir George Williams Campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ingrid |last=Peretz |title=Montreal nuns moving&amp;nbsp;— with saint's remains |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081223.wnuns23/BNStory/National/home |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=December 24, 2008 |location=Toronto |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225231506/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081223.wnuns23/BNStory/National/home |archive-date=December 25, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for $18&amp;nbsp;million. Built in 1871, it would alone double the size of the current downtown campus. From 2007 to 2022, the university will begin occupying the building in four separate phases. The large property will house the Faculty of Fine Arts and possibly the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, and other departments. Concordia Residence Life currently houses nearly 250 students each year in the Grey Nuns Building. The dorm rooms are among the largest in the country, as many of the rooms have been transformed from when the section of the Grey Nuns Building was occupied by the Grey Nuns. The site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{DFHD|13051|Mother House of the Grey Nuns of Montreal|May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concordia EV Building.jpg|thumb|The Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex on the corner of [[Saint Catherine Street]] and [[Guy Street]]]]
The Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building) at [[Saint Catherine Street]] and [[Guy Street]] was opened in September 2005. The building is directly connected to the Guy-Concordia Metro station and also houses Le Gym, a facility of Concordia's Department of Recreation and Athletics. Across the street, the 100-year-old [[TD Canada Trust]] building was donated to Concordia in 2005 by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]].

Construction of the new John Molson Building (MB), the home of the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) located on the corner of Guy Street and De Maisonneuve Boulevard West, began in February 2007. At a ceremony at Concordia on October 30, 2006, the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Quebec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports]], [[Jean-Marc Fournier]], announced an investment of $60&amp;nbsp;million towards the construction of the new building. The government's $60&amp;nbsp;million represented about half of the total construction costs. Construction started on January 22, 2006, and the building was completed and opened in September 2009. The 15-story building now houses the JMSB's [https://www.concordia.ca/about/fast-facts.html#enrolment 9,600 full- and part-time students] under the same roof for the very first time. The departments of contemporary dance, theatre and music also moved into the new JMSB Building. It is connected to the EV Building by a tunnel under Guy Street.

In April 2010, a 120-metre tunnel completed the underground connections of the Guy-Concordia Metro station with the Henry F. Hall Building and the J.W. McConnell Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concordia's new tunnel is about ready|url=http://blog.fagstein.com/2010/04/07/concordia-tunnel/|publisher=Fagstein|date=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Quartier Concordia]]===

Quartier Concordia is a neighbourhood redevelopment project centred around Concordia University's Sir George Williams Campus in downtown Montreal. Bordered by [[Sherbrooke Street]] to the north, Saint Mathieu Street to the west, [[René Lévesque Boulevard]] to the south and [[Bishop Street]] to the east,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buildings.concordia.ca/sgw/quartier.php |title==Quartier Concordia&amp;nbsp;— Concordia University |accessdate=September 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916094900/http://buildings.concordia.ca/sgw/quartier.php |archive-date=September 16, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the district is designed to be a green urban campus that will improve the use and quality of public places and spaces, student life on campus and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ledevoir.com/2006/05/20/109488.html |title=Urbanisme&amp;nbsp;— Un quartier Concordia au centre-ville |date=May 21, 2006 |newspaper=Le Devoir |author=Harvey, Réginald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quartier Concordia — Concordia University|url=http://www.concordia.ca/about/quartier-concordia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the redesign, the small [[Norman Bethune Square]] was redesigned and enlarged. Sidewalks in the area were also be widened, with additional trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacingmontreal.ca/2008/02/19/city-unveils-new-plans-for-norman-bethune-square/ |title=Norman Bethune Square's makeover confirmed |last=DeWolf |first=Christopher |date=February 19, 2008 |work=Spacing Montreal |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505035936/http://spacingmontreal.ca/2008/02/19/city-unveils-new-plans-for-norman-bethune-square |archive-date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2010, a tunnel links the university's Henry F. Hall and J.W. McConnell buildings with the Guy-Concordia Metro station. The hallway was completed in Spring 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riga&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/metropolitannews/archive/2009/04/30/concordia-s-corner.aspx |title=Montreal's Worst Construction Zone |last=Riga |first=Andy |date=April 30, 2009 |work=The Gazette|location=Montreal |publisher=Canwest |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503231335/http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/metropolitannews/archive/2009/04/30/concordia-s-corner.aspx |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a project to create a green space on [[Mackay Street]] was put on hold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.concordia.ca/notices/014675.shtml |title=University puts greening of Mackay on hold |work=News and Events |publisher=Concordia University |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517012602/http://news.concordia.ca/notices/014675.shtml |archive-date=May 17, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
The Concordia Student Union (CSU) represents undergraduate students. Its membership totals more than 35,000 students. Concordia students voted in favour of accreditation of their student union in a referendum in December 2000. As a result, the CSU is now legally accountable only to its student constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bokser |first=Howard |url=http://magazine.concordia.ca/2001-02/december/features/StudentUnion.shtml |title=Concordia University Magazine |publisher=Magazine.concordia.ca |accessdate=November 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923133422/http://magazine.concordia.ca/2001-02/december/features/StudentUnion.shtml |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student activism==
===Strike of 1999===
As the 1990s progressed, student activism began growing, coming to a head in 1999 with the election of the first in a series of radical slates to the Concordia Student Union. Under the presidency of Rob Green, a referendum regarding a strike garnered 2,284 votes of support. This was an unusually strong show of support, as student governments at Concordia are often elected on the basis of less than 1,000 votes in their favour. The strike lasted from November 3 to 5 and targeted a range of issues, including student representation in the university senate, corporate presence and advertising on campus, and government. There were several demonstrations, where both protesters and police were reported to be injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctr.concordia.ca/archives/is181199/art9.html Students hold protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

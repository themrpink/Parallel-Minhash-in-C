In 1980, [[Umberto Eco]] achieved international success  with ''[[The name of the rose]]'', a novel set in an Italian abbey in 1327 and readable both  as a historical mystery, as an allegory of the Italy in the “[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]” and as an erudite joke. The Eco’s example, like the one of Manzoni before it, relaunched the interest of Italian public and writers for the genre and many novelists  who till then had cultivated the contemporary novel, turned their hand to the stories set in the far centuries. So it was for [[Fulvio Tomizza]] (''The evil coming from North'', about the [[Reformation]]), [[Dacia Maraini]] (''The silent duchess'', about the female condition in the Eighteenth century) and [[Sebastiano Vassalli]] (''The chimera'', about the [[witch hunt]]). Among the writers emerged in the last years, [[Ernesto Ferrero]] (''[[Napoleon|N]]'') and [[Valerio Manfredi]] (''The last legion'') worth a mention.

====Bulgaria====
[[Fani Popova–Mutafova]] (1902-1977) was a Bulgarian author who is considered by many to have been the best-selling Bulgarian historical fiction author ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Chance| title=Women Medievalists and the Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QrnjT2NT5MC&amp;pg=PA501|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20750-2|pages=501–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books sold in record numbers in the 1930s and the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance2005&quot;/&gt; However, she was eventually sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Bulgarian communist regime because of some of her writings celebrating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and though released after only eleven months for health reasons, was forbidden to publish anything between 1943 and 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segel2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold B.

Historical fiction has long been a popular genre in Sweden, especially since the 1960s a huge number of historical novels has been written. Nobel laureates [[Eyvind Johnson]] and [[Pär Lagerkvist]] wrote acclaimed historical novels such as ''[[Return to Ithaca (novel)|Return to Ithaca]]'' (1946) and ''[[Barabbas (novel)|Barabbas]]'' (1950). [[Vilhelm Moberg]]'s ''[[Ride This Night]]'' (1941) is set in 16th century [[Småland]] and his widely read novel series ''[[The Emigrants (novel series)|The Emigrants]]'' tells the story of Småland emigrants to the United States in the 19th century. [[Per Anders Fogelström]] wrote a hugely popular series of five historical novels set in his native Stockholm beginning with ''[[City of My Dreams]]'' (1960). Other writers of historical fiction in Swedish literature include [[Sara Lidman]], [[Birgitta Trotzig]], [[Per Olov Enquist]] and [[Artur Lundkvist]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Brantly ''The Historical Novel, Transnationalism, and the Postmodern Era: Presenting the Past'', Routledge 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==
===Documentary fiction===
A 20th-century variant of the historical novel is documentary fiction, which incorporates &quot;not only historical characters and events, but also reports of everyday events&quot; found in contemporary newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p.194.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this variant form of historical novel include ''[[U.S.A. (trilogy)|U.S.A.]]'' (1938), and ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' (1975) by [[E.L. Doctorow]].&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional biographies===
''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]'' by the Belgian-born French writer [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] is about the life and death of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]]. First published in France in French in 1951 as ''Mémoires d'Hadrien'', the book was an immediate success, meeting with enormous critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Becoming the Emperor: How Marguerite Yourcenar reinvented the past&quot;. Books, ''The New Yorker, February 14, 2005 [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/becoming-the-emperor].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret George]] has written fictional biographies about historical persons in ''[[The Memoirs of Cleopatra]]'' (1997) and ''[[Mary, called Magdalene]]'' (2002).

Other recent [[biographical novel]] series, include ''[[Conqueror (book series)|Conqueror]]'' and ''[[Emperor (novel series)|Emperor]]'' by Conn Iggulden and ''[[Robert Harris (novelist)#Cicero trilogy|Cicero Trilogy]]'' by Robert Harris.

===Historical mysteries===
{{main|Historical mystery}}
Historical mysteries or &quot;historical [[whodunit]]s&quot; are set by their authors in the distant past, with a plot that which involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 1900s, many credit [[Ellis Peters]]'s ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael Chronicles]]'' (1977–1994) with popularizing them. These are set between 1137 and 1145 A.D.&lt;ref name=&quot;PW Picker 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/43024-mysteries-of-history.html |title=Mysteries of History |first=Lenny |last=Picker |date=3 March 2010 |access-date=13 November 2013 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474?mobile=y |title=Five Best Historical Mystery Novels |first=David B. |last=Rivkin Jr. |date=27 February 2010 |access-date=17 November 2013 |website=WSJ.com |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204114320/http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704804204575069371115999474?mobile=y |archive-date=4 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of this type of fiction in subsequent decades has created a distinct subgenre recognized by both publishers and libraries.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.writersstore.com/the-mystery-defined/ |title=The Mystery Defined |website=WritersStore.com |first=Guy |last=Magar |access-date=17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PPL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.provlib.org/node/505 |title=A Guide for Historical Fiction Lovers |website=ProvLib.org |publisher=Providence Public Library |access-date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Akron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ascplpop.akronlibrary.org/favorite-fiction-booklists/mysteries/ |title=Popular Culture: Mysteries |website=ASCPLpop.AkronLibrary.org |publisher=Akron-Summit County Public Library |access-date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical romance and family sagas===
{{main|Historical romance|Family saga|Regency romance}}
[[Historical romance|Romantic theme]]s have also been portrayed, such as ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' by [[Boris Pasternak]] and  ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' by [[Margaret Mitchell]]. One of the first popular historical romances appeared in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth'', which is set in 1751. It was not until 1935 that she wrote the first of her signature [[Regency romance|Regency]] novels, set around the [[English Regency]] period (1811–1820), when the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] ruled England in place of his ill father, [[George III]]. Heyer's Regency novels were inspired by [[Jane Austen]]'s novels of the late 18th and early 19th century. Because Heyer's writing was set in the midst of events that had occurred over 100 years previously, she included [[Authentication|authentic]] period detail in order for her readers to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Heyer referred to historical events, it was as background detail to set the period, and did not usually play a key role in the narrative. Heyer's characters often contained more modern-day sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautical and pirate fiction===
{{main|Nautical fiction|Pirates in the arts and popular culture}}
Some historical novels explore life at sea, including [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower|Hornblower series]], [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey–Maturin series]], [[Douglas Reeman|Alexander Kent]]'s [[The Bolitho novels]], [[Dudley Pope]]'s [[Lord Ramage]]'s series, all of which all deal with the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. There are also adventure novels with pirate characters like [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883), [[Emilio Salgari]]'s [[Sandokan]] (1895–1913) and ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' (1922) by [[Rafael Sabatini]]. Recent examples of historical novels about pirates are ''The Adventures of Hector Lynch'' by [[Tim Severin]], ''The White Devil (Белият Дявол)'' by Hristo Kalchev and ''The Pirate Devlin'' novels by Mark Keating.

===Alternate history and historical fantasy===
{{main|Alternate history|Historical fantasy|Alternate universe (fan fiction)}}

''[[The Plot Against America]]'' is a novel by [[Philip Roth]] published in 2004. It is an [[alternative history (fiction)|alternative history]] in which [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] is defeated in [[1940 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1940]] by [[Charles Lindbergh]] and a [[fascist]], [[anti-semitic]] government is established. There are other examples, such as [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''[[Roma Eterna]]'', in which the [[Roman Empire]] survives to the present day and [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] to the past, such as the &quot;Company&quot; stories of [[Kage Baker]]. There are authors who write in both subgenres, like [[Harry Turtledove]] in his [[Southern Victory Series|Timeline 191]] series and &quot;[[The Guns of the South]]&quot; novel, respectively. [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[What If--]]'' is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television-like device. This idea can also be found in Asimov's 1955 novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''. In that novel, the &quot;Eternals&quot; can change the realities of the world, without people being aware of it.

There is also a [[historical fantasy]] subgenre. [[Poul Anderson]] has a number of historical fantasy novels set in [[Viking]] times  including [[The Broken Sword]] and ''[[Hrolf Kraki's Saga]]''. Otherwise [[space opera]] author [[C. J. Cherryh]] has a whole historical fantasy series ''[[The Russian Stories (C. J. Cherryh)|The Russian Stories]]'' set in Medieval [[Kievan Rus]] times. [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] has number of historical fantasy novels as &quot;[[The Lions of Al-Rassan]]&quot; set in [[Renaissance]] Spain and &quot;[[The Sarantine Mosaic]]&quot; in [[Ancient Greece]]. [[David Gemmel]] has only two historical fantasy series. The first is the ''[[David Gemmell#Greek series|Greek series]]'', which are about [[Parmenion]], a general of [[Alexander the Great]]. The story is loosely based on historic events, but adds fantasy elements such as supernatural creatures and sorcery. His posthumous ''[[Troy Series]]'' features a fictional version of the [[Trojan War]]. ''[[The Sevenwaters Trilogy]]'' (later expanded)  by [[Juliet Marillier]] is set in 9th-century Ireland.

===Historiographic metafiction===
{{main|Historiographic metafiction}} 
Historiographic metafiction combines historical fiction with [[metafiction]]. The term is closely associated with [[postmodern literature]] including writers such as [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]]. 

Several novels by Nobel Prize laureate [[José Saramago]] are set in historical times including ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'', ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]]''. In a parallel plot set in the 12th and 20th century where history and fiction are constantly overlapping, the latter novel questions the reliability of historical sources and deals with the difference of writing history and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Novels of José Saramago'' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's historical fiction===
{{see also|:Category:Children's historical novels}}
A prominent subgenre within historical fiction is the children's historical novel. Often following a pedagogical bent, children's historical fiction may follow the conventions of many of the other subgenres of historical fiction. A number of such works include elements of [[historical fantasy]] or [[time travel]] to facilitate the transition between the contemporary world and the past in the tradition of children's portal fiction.  Sometimes publishers will commission series of historical novels that explore different periods and times. Among the most popular contemporary series include the [[American Girl]] novels and the [[Magic Tree House series]]. A prominent award within children's historical fiction is the [[Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction]].

===Comics and graphic novels===
{{main|:Category:Historical comics}}
Historical narratives have also found their way in comics and graphic novels. There are [[Prehistory|Prehistorical]] elements in [[jungle|jungle comics]] like [[Akim (comics)|Akim]] and [[Rahan (comics)|Rahan]]. [[Ancient Greece]] inspired [[graphic novel]]s are ''[[300 (comic)|300]]'' created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], centered around [[Battle of Thermopylae]], and ''[[Age of Bronze (comics)|Age of Bronze series]]'' by [[Eric Shanower]], that retells [[Trojan War]]. Historical subjects can also be found in [[manhua]] comics like ''[[Three Kingdoms (manhua)|Three Kingdoms]]'' and ''[[Sun Zi's Tactics]]'' by [[Lee Chi Ching]], ''[[Weapons of the Gods (comics)|Weapons of the Gods]]'' by [[Wong Yuk Long]] as well as ''[[The Ravages of Time]]'' by [[Chan Mou]]. There are also straight [[:Category:Samurai in anime and manga|Samurai manga]] series like ''[[Path of the Assassin]]'', ''[[Vagabond (manga)|Vagabond]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' and ''[[Azumi]]''. Several comics and graphic novels have been produced into anime series or a movie adaptations like ''[[Azumi (film)|Azumi]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]]''.

==The performing arts==
===Period drama films and television series===
{{main|Historical drama}}
Historical drama film stories are based upon historical events and famous people. Some [[historical drama]]s are [[docudrama]]s, which attempt an accurate portrayal of a historical event or [[biography]], to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalized tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds, such as ''[[Braveheart]]'', which is loosely based on the 13th-century knight [[William Wallace]]'s fight for [[Scotland]]'s independence. For films pertaining to the history of [[East Asia]], [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]], there are [[historical drama films set in Asia]], also known as [[Jidaigeki]] in Japan. [[:Category:Wuxia films|Wuxia films]] like ''[[The Hidden Power of the Dragon Sabre]]'' (1984) and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000), based on novels by [[Jin Yong]] and [[Wang Dulu]], have also been produced. [[Zhang Yimou]] has directed several acclaimed [[wuxia]] films like ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' (2006). Although largely fictional some wuxia films are considered historical drama. [[Samurai film]]s like [[Zatoichi]] and [[Lone Wolf and Cub]] series also fall under historical drama umbrella.  [[Peplum films]] also known as sword-and-sandal, is a genre of largely Italian-made historical or biblical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. Most pepla featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as [[Hercules]], [[Samson]], [[Goliath]], [[Ursus (film character)|Ursus]] or Italy's own popular folk hero [[Maciste]]. These supermen often rescued captive princesses from tyrannical despots and fought mythological creatures. Not all the films were fantasy-based, however. Many featured actual historical personalities such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cleopatra]], and [[Hannibal]], although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators, pirates, knights, Vikings, and slaves rebelling against tyrannical kings were also popular subjects. There are also [[Middle Ages in film|films based on Medieval narratives]] like [[Ridley Scott]]'s historical epics ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (2010) and ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' (2005) and the subgenred [[list of films based on Arthurian legend|films based on the Arthurian legend]] such as ''[[Pendragon: Sword of His Father]]'' (2008) and ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004).

Many historical narratives have been expanded into television series. Notable [[ancient history]] inspired TV series include: ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'', ''[[Egypt (TV series)|Egypt]]'', ''[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]]'' and ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I Claudius]]''. [[Tudor England]] is also a very prominent subject in television series like ''[[The Tudors]]'', ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'' and ''[[Elizabeth I (TV miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]''. Programs about the [[Napoleonic Wars]] have also been produced, like ''[[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]'' and ''[[Hornblower (TV series)|Hornblower]]''. Historical [[soap opera]]s have also been popular, including the Turkish TV series ''[[Muhteşem Yüzyıl|The Magnificent Century]]'' and ''[[Bir Zamanlar Osmanlı: Kıyam|Once Upon A Time In The Ottoman Empire: Rebellion]]''. Chinese studios have also produced television series like ''[[The Legend and the Hero]]'', its ''[[The Legend and the Hero 2|sequel series]]'', ''[[King's War]]'' and ''[[The Qin Empire (TV series)|The Qin Empire]]''. There have also been produced pure [[:Category:Wuxia television series|Wuxia television series]], many based on works by [[Jin Yong]] like ''[[Condor Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Swordsman (TV series)|Swordsman]]'', also ''[[Lu Xiaofeng#Television|Lu Xiaofeng]]'' and ''[[Chu Liuxiang#Films|Chu Liuxiang]]'' by [[Gu Long]]. They have been very popular in China, but largely unnoticed in Western media.

===The theatre===
====History plays====
{{main|History (theatrical genre)}}
History is one of the three main genres in Western [[theatre]] alongside [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]], although it originated, in its modern form, thousands of years later than the other primary genres.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkDccFRob5IC&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Other Voices, Other Views: Expanding the Canon in English Renaissance Studies |access-date=2014-08-07|isbn=9780874136807 |last1=Ostovich |first1=Helen |last2=Silcox |first2=Mary V |last3=Roebuck |first3=Graham |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is often treated as a subset of tragedy.&lt;ref name=moarribner&gt;{{cite journal| title = Marlowe's Edward II and the Tudor History Play| first= Irving| last = Ribner | journal = ELH| volume =  22| number = 4 | date = December 1955| pages =  243–253| publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press| jstor = 2871887| doi= 10.2307/2871887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A play in this genre is known as a [[history (theatrical genre)|history play]] and is based on a [[Narrative history|historical narrative]], often set in the medieval or early modern past. History emerged as a distinct genre from tragedy in [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance England]].&lt;ref name=ribner&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0LHz_Eki_IC&amp;pg=PR9 |title=The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare|author=Irving Ribner |access-date=2014-08-07|isbn=9780415353144|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known examples of the genre are the [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] written by [[William Shakespeare]], whose plays still serve to define the genre.&lt;ref name = degroot12&gt;de Groot, 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare wrote numerous history plays, some included in the [[First Folio]] as histories, and other listed as [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], or Roman plays. Among the most famous histories are ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. Other plays that feature historical characters, are the tragedy ''[[Macbeth]]'', set in the mid-11th century during the reigns of [[Duncan I of Scotland]] and [[Edward the Confessor]], and the Roman plays ''[[Coriolanus]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''. Another tragedy ''[[King Lear]]'', is based on British [[legend]], as is the [[Shakespeare's late romances|romanc]] ''Cymbeline, King of Britain'', which is set in Ancient Britain.

Other playwrights contemporary to Shakespeare, such as [[Christopher Marlowe]], also dramatized historical topics.&lt;ref name = degroot12/&gt; Marlowe wrote ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' which deals with the deposition of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs, and  ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', which dramatizes the events of the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in France in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Richard (2004). &quot;Tragedy, Patronage and Power&quot;. in Cheney, Patrick, 2007, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe's ''[[Tamburlaine the Great]]'' (1587 or 1588) is a play in two parts, loosely based on the life of the [[Central Asia]]n emperor, [[Timur]] &quot;the lame&quot;.

History plays also appear elsewhere in other western literature. The German authors [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]] wrote a number of historical plays, including Goethe's ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'' (1788), which is set in the 16th century, and is heavily influenced by Shakespearean tragedy, and Schiller's ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', which depicts the last days of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (1800). This play formed the basis for [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s opera ''[[Maria Stuarda]]'' (1834). Beethoven [[Egmont (Beethoven)|wrote incidental music]] for ''Egmont''.

Later Irish author [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote several histories, including ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1898) and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', which based on the life and trial of [[Joan of Arc]]. Published in 1924, not long after the canonization of Joan of Arc by the Roman Catholic Church, the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. One of the most famous 20th-century history plays is ''[[The Life of Galileo]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] which dramatises  the latter period of the life of [[Galileo Galilei]], the great [[Italians|Italian]] [[natural philosopher]], who was persecuted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries; for details, see [[Galileo affair]]. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between [[dogmatism]] and [[Science|scientific evidence]], as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.

More recently British dramatist [[Howard Brenton]] has written several histories. He gained notoriety for his play ''[[The Romans in Britain]]'', first staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the contemporary British military presence in [[Northern Ireland]]. Its concerns with politics were, however, overshadowed by controversy surrounding a rape scene. Brenton also wrote ''Anne Boleyn'' a play on the life of [[Anne Boleyn]], which premiered at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2010. Anne Boleyn is portrayed as a significant force in the political and religious in-fighting at court and a furtherer of the cause of [[Protestantism]] in her enthusiasm for the [[Tyndale Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/anne-boleyn-shakespeares-globe-london-2315856.html  Michael Coveney, The Independent, 19 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opera====
{{main|grand opera|opera}}
One of the first operas to use historical events and people is [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s [[L'incoronazione di Poppea]], which was first performed in [[Venice]] during the 1643 carnival season. it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman [[emperor Nero]], is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times. [[George Frederick Handel]] also wrote several operas based on historical characters, including ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' (1724), ''[[Tamerlano]]'' (1724) and ''[[Rodelinda (opera)|Rodelinda]]'' (1725).

Historical subjects for operas also developed during the 19th century. Usually with 4 or 5 acts, they are large-scale casts and orchestras, and spectacular staging. Several operas by [[Gaspare Spontini]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], and [[Gioachino Rossini]] can be regarded as precursors to French [[grand opera]]. These include Spontini's ''[[La vestale]]'' (1807) and ''[[Fernand Cortez]]'' (1809, revised 1817), Cherubini's ''[[Les Abencérages]]'' (1813), and Rossini's ''[[Le siège de Corinthe]]'' (1827) and ''[[Mosè in Egitto|Moïse et Pharaon]]'' (1828). All of these have some of the characteristics of size and spectacle that are normally associated with French grand opera. Another important forerunner was ''[[Il crociato in Egitto]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], who eventually became the acknowledged king of the grand opera genre. Amongst the most important opera composers on historical topics are [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]].

Russian composers also wrote operas based on historical figures, including ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]] (1839–1881), which was composed between 1868 and 1873, and is considered his masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi, Abraham (1974: pp. 98, 138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1986: p 31)&lt;/ref&gt; Its subjects are the Russian ruler [[Boris Godunov]], who reigned as [[Tsar]] (1598 to 1605). Equally famous is [[Alexander Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]'', the libretto for which the composer developed from the Ancient Russian [[epic (genre)|epic]] ''The Lay of Igor's Host'', which recounts the campaign of [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] prince [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] against the invading [[Cuman]] (&quot;Polovtsian&quot;) tribes in 1185.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, G. and Lloyd-Jones, D. (1986) &quot;Alexander Borodin&quot; in Brown, D. (ed.) The New Grove: Russian Masters 1, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., pp. 45–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical reenactment===
{{main|Historical reenactment}}
Historical reenactment is an educational or entertainment activity in which people follow a plan to recreate aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle, such as the reenactment of [[Pickett's Charge]] presented during the [[Great Reunion of 1913]], or as broad as an entire period, such as [[Regency reenactment]] or [[The 1920s Berlin Project]].

==Theory and criticism==
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic, essayist, and social theorist [[György Lukács]] wrote extensively on the aesthetic and political significance of the historical novel. In 1937's ''Der historische Roman'', published originally in Russian, Lukács developed critical readings of several historical novels by various authors, including [[Gottfried Keller]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]]. He interprets the advent of the &quot;genuinely&quot; historical novel at the beginning of the 19th century in terms of two developments, or processes. The first is the development of a specific genre in a specific medium—the historical novel's unique stylistic and narrative elements. The second is the development of a representative, organic artwork that can capture the fractures, contradictions, and problems of the particular productive mode of its time (i.e., developing, early, entrenched [[capitalism]]).

{{French literature sidebar}}{{Liberalism sidebar}}'''Victor Marie Hugo''' ({{IPA-fr|viktɔʁ maʁi yɡo|lang|Victor_Hugo.ogg}}; 7 [[Ventôse]] year X [26 February 1802] – 22 May 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]. During a literary career that spanned more than sixty years, he wrote abundantly in an exceptional variety of genres: lyrics, satires, epics, philosophical poems, epigrams, novels, history, critical essays, political speeches, funeral orations, diaries, letters public and private, and dramas in verse and prose.

Hugo is considered to be one of the greatest and best-known French writers. Outside France, his most famous works are the novels ''[[Les Misérables]]'', 1862, and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' ({{lang-fr|links=no|Notre-Dame de Paris}}), 1831. In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as {{lang|fr|[[Les Contemplations]]}} (''The Contemplations'') and {{lang|fr|[[La Légende des siècles]]}} (''The Legend of the Ages''). Hugo was at the forefront of the [[Romanticism|Romantic literary movement]] with his play ''[[Cromwell (play)|Cromwell]]'' and drama ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the musicals ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' and ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]''. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of [[Capital punishment in France|capital punishment]].

Though a committed [[royalist]] when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of [[republicanism]]; his work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism and his colossal literary achievement established him as a national hero. He was honoured by interment in the [[Panthéon]].

== Early life ==
Victor-Marie Hugo was born on 26 February 1802 in {{lang|fr|[[Besançon]]|italic=no}} in Eastern [[France]]. The youngest son of [[Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo]] (1774–1828) a general in the [[Napoleonic army]], and [[Sophie Trébuchet]] (1772–1821); the couple had two more sons: {{lang|fr|Abel Joseph|italic=no}} (1798–1855) and {{lang|fr|Eugène|italic=no}} (1800–1837).  The Hugo family came from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] where Victor Hugo's grandfather was a wood merchant. Léopold enlisted in the army of [[Revolutionary France]] at fourteen, he was an atheist and an ardent supporter of the republic created following the abolition of the monarchy in 1792.  Victor's mother Sophie was a devout Catholic who remained loyal to the deposed [[House of Bourbon|dynasty]]. They met in [[Châteaubriant]], a few miles from Nantes in 1796 and married the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb 1999 p.&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU9LloPylhQC|title=Victor Hugo|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1999|isbn=978-0-393-31899-9|page=12|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Hugo's father was an officer in Napoleon's army, the family moved frequently from posting to posting, Sophie had three children in four years. Léopold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the [[Vosges Mountains]], on a journey from Lunéville to Besançon. &quot;This elevated origin&quot;, he went on, &quot;seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Escholier, Raymond, ''Victor Hugo raconté par ceux qui l'ont vu'', Librairie Stock, 1931, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo believed himself to have been conceived on 24 June 1801, which is the origin of [[Jean Valjean]]'s prisoner number [[24601]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Novel of the Century : The extraordinary adventure of Les Miserables|last=Bellos|first=David|publisher=Particular Books|year=2017|isbn=978-1-846-14470-7|location=|pages=162|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weary of the constant moving required by military life, Sophie separated temporarily from Léopold and settled in Paris in 1803 with her sons; she began seeing General [[Victor Fanneau de La Horie]], Hugo's godfather who had been a comrade of General Hugo's during the campaign in Vendee. In October 1807 the family rejoined Leopold, now Colonel Hugo, Governor of the province of [[Province of Avellino|Avellino]]. Sophie found out that Leopold had been living in secret with an Englishwoman called Catherine Thomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens 2019 p. 24&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=B.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laCKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|title=Victor Hugo|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-78914-111-5|series=Critical Lives|page=24|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon Hugo's father was called to Spain to fight the [[Peninsular War]]. Madame Hugo and her children were sent back to Paris in 1808, where they moved to an old convent, 12 {{Lang|fr|Impasse des Feuillantines|italic=no}}, an isolated mansion in a deserted quarter of the left bank of the Seine. Hiding in a chapel at the back of the garden, was Victor Fanneau de La Horie, who had conspired to restore the Bourbons and had been condemned to death a few years earlier. He became a mentor to Victor and his brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caussé p. 4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Caussé|first=E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlxcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP4|title=Victor Hugo - Tout pour briller en société|publisher=Les Éditions de l'Ebook malin|page=4|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 the family joined their father in Spain, Victor and his brothers were sent to school in Madrid at the {{Lang|es|Real Colegio de San Antonio de Abad}} while Sophie returned to Paris on her own, now officially separated from her husband. In 1812 Victor Fanneau de La Horie was arrested and executed. In February 1815 Victor and Eugene were taken away from their mother and placed by their father in the Pension Cordier, a private boarding school in Paris, where Victor and Eugène remained three years while also attending lectures at [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand|Lycée Louis le Grand.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb 2017 p. 49&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNslDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49|title=Victor Hugo|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5098-5565-0|page=49|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 1816, Hugo wrote in his diary: “I shall be Chateaubriand or nothing”. In 1817 he wrote a poem for a competition organised by l’[[Académie Française|Academie Française]], for which he received an honorable mention. The Academicians refused to believe that he was only fifteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 1878 p. 11&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=King | first=E. | title=French Political Leaders | publisher=G.P.

Victor fell in love and secretly became engaged, against his mother's wishes, to his childhood friend [[Adèle Foucher]]. In June 1821 Sophie Trebuchet died, and Léopold married his long time mistress Catherine Thomas a month later. Victor married Adèle the following year.  In 1819, Victor and his brothers began publishing a periodical called {{Lang|fr|Le Conservateur littéraire}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frey Laster Hugo 1999 p. 201&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frey|first1=J.A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olFboDm4bcgC&amp;pg=PA201|title=A Victor Hugo Encyclopedia|last2=Laster|first2=A.|last3=Hugo|first3=V.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-313-29896-7|series=ABC-Clio ebook|page=201|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Hugo published his first novel the year following his marriage ({{lang|fr|[[Han d'Islande]]}}, 1823), and his second three years later (''[[Bug-Jargal]]'', 1826). Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry ({{lang|fr|[[Les Orientales]]}}, 1829; {{lang|fr|[[Les Feuilles d'automne]]}}, 1831; {{lang|fr|[[Les Chants du crépuscule]]}}, 1835; {{lang|fr|[[Les Voix intérieures]]}}, 1837; and {{lang|fr|[[Les Rayons et les Ombres]]}}, 1840), cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.

Like many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by {{lang|fr|[[François-René de Chateaubriand]]|italic=no}}, the famous figure in the literary movement of [[Romanticism]] and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be &quot;{{lang|fr|Chateaubriand|italic=no}} or nothing&quot;, and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways. Like {{lang|fr|Chateaubriand|italic=no}}, Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of [[Republicanism]]), and was forced into [[exile]] due to his political stances.

The precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry ({{lang|fr|[[Odes et poésies diverses]]}}) was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 ({{lang|fr|[[Odes et Ballades]]}}) revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.

Victor Hugo's first mature work of fiction was first published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author's name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. {{lang|fr|Le Dernier jour d'un condamné}} (''[[The Last Day of a Condemned Man]]'') would have a profound influence on later writers such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. {{lang|fr|[[Claude Gueux]]|italic=no}}, a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France, appeared in 1834 and was later considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, {{lang|fr|[[Les Misérables]]}}.

Hugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays ''Cromwell'' (1827) and ''Hernani'' (1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=State Library of Victoria |title=Victor Hugo: Les Misérables – From Page to Stage research guide |url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/victorhugo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180659/http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/victorhugo |archivedate=14 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hernani'' announced the arrival of French romanticism: performed at the [[Comédie-Française]], it was greeted with several nights of rioting as romantics and traditionalists clashed over the play's deliberate disregard for neo-classical rules. Hugo's popularity as a playwright grew with subsequent plays, such as ''Marion Delorme'' (1831), ''The King Amuses Himself'' (1832), and ''Ruy Blas'' (1838).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar G. ''History of the Theatre''. Eight Edition. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999. P. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hugo's novel {{lang|fr|Notre-Dame de Paris}} (''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'') was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much-neglected [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame]], which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel. The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre-Renaissance buildings, which thereafter began to be actively preserved.

Hugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but a full 17 years were needed for {{lang|fr|Les Misérables}} to be realised and finally published in 1862.
Hugo had used the departure of prisoners for the [[Bagne of Toulon]] in one of his early stories, &quot;Le Dernier Jour d'un condamné&quot; He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: &quot; JEAN TRÉJEAN&quot;.

Hugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel, as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher, Albert Lacroix, on 23 March 1862, &quot;My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks, if not the crowning point of my work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alalettre.com/Hugo-miserables.htm|title=Les Misérables de Victor Hugo |work=alalettre.com|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication of ''Les Misérables'' went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house {{lang|fr|Lacroix|italic=no}} and {{lang|nl|Verboeckhoven|nocat=y}} undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel (&quot;[[Fantine]]&quot;), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours and had enormous impact on French society.

The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; {{lang|fr|[[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]]|italic=no}} found it insincere, {{lang|fr|[[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]]|italic=no}} complained of its vulgarity, {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Flaubert]]|italic=no}} found within it &quot;neither truth nor greatness&quot;, the [[Goncourt brothers|{{lang|fr|Goncourt|nocat=y}} brothers]] lambasted its artificiality, and {{lang|fr|[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]|italic=no}} – despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers – castigated it in private as &quot;repulsive and inept&quot;. ''Les Misérables'' proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the [[National Assembly of France]]. Today, the novel remains his most well-known work. It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema, television, and stage shows.

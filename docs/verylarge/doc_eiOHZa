This initial categorization differentiates between violence that a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations.

Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-directed violence ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s – also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries – and completed suicides. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as [[self-mutilation]].

=== Collective violence ===
[[File:The Bochnia massacre German-occupied Poland 1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] civilians during [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], 1939]]

Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain – such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.

=== Warfare ===
{{Main|War}}

[[File:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|A United States [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car in Paris during World War II]]
War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'', p. 64, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as [[war of aggression]] to conquer territory or loot resources, in national [[self-defence]] or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to [[secession|secede]] from it. There are also ideological, [[Religious war|religious]] and [[Revolution|revolutionary war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'', p. 84, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] the lethality of modern warfare has grown. [[World War I casualties]] were over 40 million and [[World War II casualties]] were over 70 million.

=== Interpersonal violence ===

'''Interpersonal violence''' is divided into two subcategories: Family and [[intimate partner violence]] – that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence – violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as [[child abuse]], intimate partner violence and [[elderly abuse|abuse of the elderly]]. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, [[rape]] or [[sexual assault]] by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes. When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of violent fathers, posttraumatically stressed mothers, and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/debdfb68e769c470a8fc565c9eb2114b91f6df75| journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 26 | issue = 18| pages = 3699–3719 | doi=10.1177/0886260511403747 | pmid=22170456| s2cid = 206562093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child maltreatment ====
{{Main|Child abuse}}
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], [[neglect]], [[negligence]] and commercial or other [[child exploitation]], which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2006). [https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html &quot;Preventing child maltreatment: a guide to taking action and generating evidence&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719072520/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/child_maltreatment/en/index.html |date=2012-07-19 }} Geneva: WHO and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009). The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children. In CH Zeanah (Ed.). Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition. New York: Guilford Press, Inc. pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltenborgh M. |author2=Van IJzendoorn M.H. |author3=Euser E.M. |author4=Bakermans-Kranenburg M.J. | year = 2011 | title = A global perspective on child abuse: Meta-analysis of prevalence around the world | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1177/1077559511403920 |pmid=21511741 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.9752 |s2cid=30813632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert R. |author2=Spatz Widom C. |author3=Browne K. |author4=Fergusson D. |author5=Webb E. |author6=Janson J. | year = 2009 | title = Burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries | journal = The Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9657| pages = 68–81 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)61706-7 | pmid=19056114|s2cid=1464691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.

==== Youth violence ====
[[File:Kids off the Block Rocks in grass IMG 4815.JPG|thumb|The [[Kids off the Block]] memorial featuring hundreds of simple stone blocks, one for each child killed by violence in [[Roseland, Chicago]] ]]

Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from [[bullying]] and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23&quot;&gt;Mercy, J.A., Butchart, A., Farrington, D., Cerda, M. (2002). Youth violence. In Etienne Krug, L.L. Dahlberg, J.A. Mercy, A.B. Zwi &amp; R. Lozano (Eds.), [https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ World Report on Violence and Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }} pp 23–56.

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year (&quot;Global Burden of Disease&quot;, World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20-40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23&quot; /&gt; Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.{{vague|date=July 2020}}

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Liverpool John Moores University.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf &quot;Violence prevention: the evidence: overview&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193235/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva, WHO, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.01216 | volume=12 | title=Children and youth in neighborhood contexts | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=27–31 | year=2003 | author=Leventhal Tama| s2cid=145110900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, urban renewal projects such as [[business improvement district]]s have shown a reduction in youth violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rand report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020054800/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape), and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies. According to researchers in 2018, &quot;More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence.&quot; The violence &quot;can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | department=The Conversation US |author=Darby Saxbe | title=Living with Neighborhood Violence May Shape Teens' Brains | magazine=Scientific American | date=June 15, 2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/living-with-neighborhood-violence-may-shape-teens-rsquo-brains/ | access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consequences Youth Violence |url=https://vetoviolence.cdc.gov/consequences-youth-violence |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth violence impacts individuals, their families, and society. Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up. Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills. Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. &quot;Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |access-date=November 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). &quot;Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018&quot; /&gt;

It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short- and long-term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they've experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Body Keeps The Score&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 |access-date=December 2, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions. Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=September 8, 2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780143127741/page/464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping. Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts. This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fabian |first1=Renee |title=Healing Invisible Wounds: Art Therapy and PTSD |url=https://www.healthline.com/health/art-therapy-for-ptsd |website=Healthline |access-date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Body Keeps The Score&quot;/&gt; This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. Many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |access-date=19 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119233208/https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |archive-date=19 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence. If the youth do not have a safe place to go after school hours they will likely get into trouble, receive poor grades, drop out of school and use drugs and alcohol. The gangs look for youth who do not have positive influences in their life and need protection. This is why these programs are so important for the youth to have a safe environment rather than resorting to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Rosa |title=Why parents in tough Chicago neighborhoods fear after-school program cuts |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/us/chicago-after-school-program-cuts/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intimate partner violence ====

{{Main|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence}}
Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005). [https://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ &quot;WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women&quot;] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224124426/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ |date=2011-02-24 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70% (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]], sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stith SM | year = 2004 | title = Intimate partner physical abuse perpetration and victimization risk factors: a meta-analytic review | url =https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/14851/1/STITHAVB2004.pdf | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 65–98 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.09.001|display-authors=etal| hdl = 2097/14851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and [[antisocial personality disorder]].

A recent theory named &quot;The Criminal Spin&quot; suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bensimon M. |author2=Ronel N. | year = 2012 | title = The flywheel effect of intimate partner violence: A victim-perpetrator interactive spin | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 423–429 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee V.A. | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the long-term effects of the Safe Dates program and a booster in preventing and reducing adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 4| pages = 619–624 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.619|display-authors=etal| pmc = 1448308 | pmid=15054015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies – those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 11| pages = 824–832 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.056580|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2770274 | pmid=20072767}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;&gt;WHO(2010).[https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf &quot;Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking action and generating evidence&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112035242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf |date=2011-11-12 }} World Health Organization: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual violence ====
{{Main|Sexual violence}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.&lt;ref&gt;Krug et al.,[https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ &quot;World report on violence and health&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, World Health Organization, 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3–11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005).[https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ &quot;WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193441/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S.E. et al. (2011). Adverse childhood experiences and smoking status in five states. Preventive Medicine: 43, 3, 188-193.&lt;/ref&gt; drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for [[domestic violence]]. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot; /&gt;

==== Elder maltreatment ====
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], emotional; [[financial abuse|financial]] and material abuse; abandonment; [[neglect]]; and serious loss of [[dignity]] and [[respect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt;

While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home&lt;ref&gt;Sethi et al.

Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/792751c8e0953c82a111266c43ddc76236025b17| journal = Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187–210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 |s2cid=42017274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pillemer K et al. &quot;Interventions to prevent elder mistreatment&quot;.

=== Targeted violence ===
Several rare but painful episodes of [[assassination]], attempted assassination and [[school shooting]]s at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called &quot;targeted violence,&quot; described the &quot;path to violence&quot; of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just &quot;come out of the blue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, R.A., Vossekuil, B. &amp; Holden, G.

=== Everyday violence ===
As an anthropological concept, &quot;everyday violence&quot; may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammeltoft|first=Tine M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Silence as a Response to Everyday Violence: Understanding Domination and Distress Through the Lens of Fantasy|journal=Ethos|volume=44|issue=4|pages=427–447|doi=10.1111/etho.12140|issn=1548-1352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|title=everyday violence {{!}} The Ethnography of Political Violence|website=ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com|access-date=2018-02-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213200042/https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|archive-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|title=Philippe Bourgois - The Power of Violence in War and Peace|website=istmo.denison.edu|access-date=2018-02-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423065302/http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|archive-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], the region with the highest murder rate in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Violent crime has undermined democracy in Latin America |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bbc9228-a09f-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d |work=Financial Times |date=9 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; experienced more than 2.5 million murders between 2000 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Latin America Is the Murder Capital of the World |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/400-murders-a-day-the-crisis-of-latin-america-1537455390 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical perspectives ===

Some philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent.{{efn|name=knowledge|'any interpretation of reality is always a form of violence in the sense that knowledge &quot;can only be a violation of the things to be known&quot; ... Several philosophers following Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, and Derrida have emphasized and explicated this fundamental violence.' &lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Johanna Oksala|title=Foucault, Politics, and Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQzaok_Y-jgC&amp;pg=PR1|year=2012|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-2802-6|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} [[Slavoj Žižek]] in his book ''Violence'' stated that &quot;something violent is the very symobolization of a thing.&quot; This harm inflicted by the very interpretation of the world is known as '''ontological violence'''.  Ontological violence is distinct from physical violence in that it is possible to avoid physical violence whereas some ontological is intrinsic to all knowledge.{{efn|&quot;While the ontological violence of language does, in significant ways, sustain, enable, and encourage physical violence, it is a serious mistake to conflate them. [...] Violence is understood to be ineliminable in the first sense, and this leads to tis being treated as a fundamental in the seconed sense, too.&quot; &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot;/&gt; {{rp|36}}}}

Both [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] considered the relationship between [[Power (social and political)|power]] and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;foucault&quot; /&gt;{{rp|46}}

In [[feminist philosophy]], [[epistemic injustice|epistemic violence]] is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance. Some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups.{{efn|name=epistemic|&quot;Epistemic violence in testimony is a refusal, intentional or unintentional, of an  audience  to  communicatively  reciprocate  a  linguistic  exchange  owing  to pernicious  ignorance&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dotson 2011 pp. 236–257&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dotson | first=Kristie | title=Tracking Epistemic Violence, Tracking Practices of Silencing | journal=Hypatia | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=2011 | issn=0887-5367 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01177.x | pages=236–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Factors ==
Violence cannot be attributed to a single factor. Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C. J. | title = Psychophysiological correlates of aggression and violence: An integrative review | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 363 | issue = 1503 | pages = 2543–2555 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434285 | pmc = 2606710 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrory | first1 = E. | last2 = De Brito | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Viding | first3 = E. | title = The link between child abuse and psychopathology: A review of neurobiological and genetic research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 151–156 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22532655 | pmc = 3343716| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person's risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, [[income inequality]], the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===
While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durrant |first1=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031091526/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html |date=2010-10-31 }} (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[domestic corporal punishment]] has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-27 |access-date=2015-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms &quot;the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families&quot;, whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Straus Murray A | year = 2000 | title = Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society&quot; (PDF) | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | journal = Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110040441/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | archive-date = 2011-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
The causes of violent behavior in people are often a topic of research in [[psychology]]. [[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, &quot;violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War? How early humans behaved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715062002/http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html |date=2007-07-15 }}, LiveScience.Com, March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as &quot;violent&quot;. For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as &quot;violent&quot;, though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or [[structural violence]], and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior. It has been discussed at length by researchers in [[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Galtung Johan | author-link = Johan Galtung | year = 1969 | title = Violence, Peace and Peace Research | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 167–91 | doi=10.1177/002234336900600301| s2cid = 143440399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Galtung Johan |author2=Höivik Tord | year = 1971 | title = Structural and Direct Violence: A Note on Operationalization | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 73–76 | doi=10.1177/002234337100800108|s2cid=109656035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[medical anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul, M.

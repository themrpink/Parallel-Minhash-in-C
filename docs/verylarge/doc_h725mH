The gene pool of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the variety of genetic information in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive [[genetic diversity]]) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottlenecks]]) reduces the range of adaptions possible.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Habitat degradation ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] may alter the [[fitness landscape]] to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming [[toxicity|toxic]], or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through [[contamination]] or [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of [[tropical rainforest]]s and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a [[fern]] that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by [[bottom trawling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clover |first=Charles |year=2004 |title=The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-189780-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. [[Global warming]] has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome{{according to whom|date=May 2016}} competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including [[water]] and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
{{See also|Island restoration}}
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (some people would say premature extinction{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by [[introduced species|transporting]] [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. [[livestock]] released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. [[rat]]s escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an [[Invasive species|invasive alien species]] does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect [[Endemic (ecology)|native]] species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing [[pathogen]]s or [[parasite]]s that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the &quot;overkill hypothesis&quot;, the swift extinction of the [[megafauna]] in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (12,000 years before present), [[Madagascar]], [[Hawaii]] (AD 300–1000), and New Zealand (AD 1300–1500), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;Lee, Anita. &quot;[http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesFA2002/geog148/Term%20Papers/Anita%20Lee/THEPLE~1.html The Pleistocene Overkill Hypothesis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014100508/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesFA2002/geog148/Term%20Papers/Anita%20Lee/THEPLE~1.html |date=October 14, 2006 }}.&quot; ''University of California at Berkeley Geography Program.''

=== Coextinction ===
{{Main|Coextinction}}
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|The large [[Haast's eagle]] and [[moa]] from New Zealand]]

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of [[parasitism|parasitic]] insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its [[pollinator]], or to [[predator]]s in a [[food chain]] who lose their prey. &quot;Species coextinction is a manifestation of one of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems&amp;nbsp;... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koh&quot;&gt;Koh, Lian Pih. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Vol 305, Issue 5690, 1632–1634, 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Coextinction is especially common when a [[keystone species]] goes extinct.
Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of [[biodiversity loss]]. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the [[trophic level]]s. Such effects are most severe in [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the [[Haast's eagle]] and the [[moa]]: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Robert|last2=Harris|first2=Nyeema|author-link2=Nyeema Harris|author3=Robert Colwell|author4=Lian Pin Koh|author5=Navjot Sodhi|title= Proceedings of the Royal Society|work=The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists?|publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|year=2009|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1670/3037.short|access-date=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 survey&lt;!-- Needs updating.

For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a [[species]] was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Prior to the 19th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Stephen|date=2009|title=Thomas Jefferson, extinction, and the evolving view of Earth history in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries|url=http://memoirs.gsapubs.org/content/203/225.abstract|journal=GSA Memoirs|volume=203|pages=225–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the [[great chain of being]], in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33224/33224-h/33224-h.htm|title=The Principles of Geology or, The Modern Changes of the Earth and its Inhabitants Considered as Illustrative of Geology|last=Lyells|first=Charles|publisher=Appleton Co|year=1854|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a firm supporter of the great chain of being and an opponent of extinction,&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/on-the-extinction-of-species/|title=On the Extinction of Species|last=Bressan|first=David|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; famously denying the extinction of the [[woolly mammoth]] on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqHwCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Extinction,+diversity,+and+endangerment%22+david+sepkoski&amp;pg=PT88|title=Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture|last1=Vidal|first1=Fernando|last2=Dias|first2=Nélia|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-53807-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, [[Robert Hooke]] presented an impression of a [[nautilus]] to the [[Royal Society]] that was more than two feet in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottengeniusb0000inwo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/forgottengeniusb0000inwo/page/403 403]|quote=hooke nautilus.|title=The Forgotten Genius: The Biography of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703|last=Inwood|first=Stephen|date=2005|publisher=MacAdam/Cage Publishing|isbn=978-1-59692-115-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and morphologically distinct from any known living species. [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; While he contended that it was possible a species could be &quot;lost&quot;, he thought this highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; Similarly, in 1695, [[Sir Thomas Molyneux]] published an account of enormous antlers found in [[Ireland]] that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molyneux|first=Thomas|date=1695-01-01|title=A Discourse Concerning the Large Horns Frequently Found under Ground in Ireland, Concluding from Them That the Great American Deer, Call'd a Moose, Was Formerly Common in That Island: With Remarks on Some Other Things Natural to That Country.

When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply &quot;hiding&quot; in unexplored regions of the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2&quot;&gt;''Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud'' ([[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-60726-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the [[French Institute]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot;/&gt; though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perilous planet earth : catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages|last=Trevor.|first=Palmer|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81928-2|oclc=912273245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot; /&gt; His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the [[Paris Basin|Paris basin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot; /&gt; Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot; /&gt; In 1812, Cuvier, along with [[Alexandre Brongniart]] and [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], mapped the [[Stratum|strata]] of the Paris basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt; From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;

Cuvier's fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; The primary debate focused on whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt; Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Georges Cuvier, fossil bones, and geological catastrophes : new translations &amp; interpretations of the primary texts|last=S.|first=Rudwick, M.J.|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73106-3|oclc=45730036}}&lt;/ref&gt; His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], a [[Gradualism|gradualist]] and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt; While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt; Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:62&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The age of Lamarck : evolutionary theories in France, 1790–1830|last=Renato)|first=Mandelbaum, Jonathan (Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05830-9|oclc=898833548|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Lyell]], a noted geologist and founder of [[uniformitarianism]], believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the [[dodo]] and the extirpation of [[History of the horse in Britain|indigenous horses]] to the British Isles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; He similarly argued against [[mass extinction]]s, believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt; Lyell also showed that Cuvier's original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]], like those seen in the Paris basin, could be formed by a slow rise and fall of [[sea level]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot; /&gt;

The concept of extinction was integral to [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of [[Competition (biology)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/the-lost-world-2|title=The Lost World|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide reach of ''On the Origin of Species'', it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept now referred to as [[Background extinction rate|background extinction]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;:42&quot; /&gt; It was not until 1982, when [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of [[zoology]], and [[biology]] in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the [[WWF (conservation organization)|Worldwide Fund for Nature]], have been created with  the goal of preserving species from extinction. [[Government]]s have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and [[pollution]]. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous [[virus]]es, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were &quot;undesirable&quot;, or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the [[American bison]], which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], many of whom relied on the bison for food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotzman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Biologist Bruce Walsh states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and [[ethics]]; and today the scientific community &quot;stress[es] the importance&quot; of maintaining biodiversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;Walsh, Bruce.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' can be devastating to wildlife (for example, [[DDT]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;INCHEM&quot;&gt;International Programme on Chemical Safety (1989). &quot;[http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc83.htm DDT and its Derivatives – Environmental Aspects]&quot;.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction [[risk]]s. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with [[human overpopulation]] in tropical [[developing country|developing countries]], there has been enormous pressure on forests due to [[subsistence agriculture]], including [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Anne | last1= Ehrlich | title = Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species | publisher= Random House, New York | year= 1981 | isbn= 978-0-394-51312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antinatalist]] philosopher [[David Benatar]] concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that &quot;we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal.&quot; He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|date=2008|title=Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence|url=https://archive.org/details/betternevertohav0000bena/page/197|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/betternevertohav0000bena/page/197 197]|isbn=978-0-19-954926-9|quote=It is noteworthy that human concern about human extinction takes a different form from human concern (where there is any) about the extinction of non-human species. Most humans who are concerned about the extinction of non-human species are not concerned about the individual animals whose lives are cut short in the passage to extinction, even though that is one of the best reasons to be concerned about extinction (at least in its killing form). The popular concern about animal extinction is usually concern for humans—that we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal. In other words, none of the typical concerns about human extinction are applied to non-human species extinction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Treponema pallidum|Treponema pallidum pertenue]]'', a bacterium which causes the disease [[yaws]], is in the process of being eradicated.

Biologist [[Olivia Judson]] has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying [[mosquito]] species. In a September 25, 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', she advocated &quot;specicide&quot; of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create [[recessive]] &quot;[[Gene knockout|knockout genes]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judson&quot;/&gt; She says that the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[malaria]]) and ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (which spread [[dengue fever]], [[yellow fever]], [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]], and other diseases) represent only 30 of around 3,500 mosquito species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the [[genetic diversity]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Culicidae]] by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct &quot;all the time&quot; the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the [[ecosystem]]: &quot;We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse.&quot; In addition, anti-malarial and [[Mosquito#Control|mosquito control programs]] offer little realistic hope to the 300&amp;nbsp;million people in [[developing nation]]s who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: &quot;We should consider the ultimate swatting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Judson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/opinion/a-bug-s-death.html |title=A Bug's Death |date=September 25, 2003 |author=Olivia Judson |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date=17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''. Wilson stated, &quot;I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them.

=== Cloning ===
{{Main|De-extinction}}
Some, such as Harvard geneticist [[George M. Church]], believe that ongoing technological advances will let us &quot;bring back to life&quot; an extinct species by [[Cloning#Cloning extinct and endangered species|cloning]], using [[DNA]] from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the [[mammoth]], the [[thylacine]], and the [[Pyrenean ibex]]. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though [[bioethics|bioethical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] objections have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/24/news/mn-4250/2 |title= Cloned Goat Would Revive Extinct Line |author= A.

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct [[Pyrenean ibex]] (''C. p. pyrenaica''). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 [[mountain goat]]s and mountain goat-domestic [[goat]] hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cloned-goat-dies-after-attempt-to-bring-species-back-from-extinction-1522974.html |title= Cloned goat dies after attempt to bring species back from extinction |author= Steve Connor |date= 2009-02-02 |work= [[The Independent]] |access-date=2010-05-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Jan 2009|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Gray|first2=Roger|last2=Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor''' ('''CMOS'''), also known as '''complementary-symmetry metal–oxide–semiconductor''' ('''COS-MOS'''), is a type of [[MOSFET|metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication process]] that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] and [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] MOSFETs for logic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is CMOS Memory? |url=http://wickedsago.blogspot.com/2011/04/what-is-cmos-memory.html |work=Wicked Sago |accessdate=3 March 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926064548/http://wickedsago.blogspot.com/2011/04/what-is-cmos-memory.html |archivedate=26 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMOS technology is used for constructing [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips, including [[microprocessor]]s, [[microcontroller]]s, [[memory chip]]s (including [[Nonvolatile BIOS memory|CMOS BIOS]]), and other [[digital logic]] circuits. CMOS technology is also used for [[analog circuit]]s such as [[image sensor]]s ([[CMOS sensor]]s), [[data conversion|data converters]], [[RF circuit]]s ([[RF CMOS]]), and highly integrated [[transceiver]]s for many types of communication.

[[Mohamed M. Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] invented the MOSFET at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959, and then demonstrated the [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] (p-type MOS) and [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] (n-type MOS) fabrication processes in 1960. These processes were later combined and adapted into the complementary MOS (CMOS) process by [[Chih-Tang Sah]] and [[Frank Wanlass]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in 1963. [[RCA]] commercialized the technology with the trademark &quot;COS-MOS&quot; in the late 1960s, forcing other manufacturers to find another name, leading to &quot;CMOS&quot; becoming the standard name for the technology by the early 1970s. CMOS eventually overtook NMOS as the dominant MOSFET fabrication process for [[very large-scale integration]] (VLSI) chips in the 1980s, while also replacing earlier [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) technology. CMOS has since remained the standard fabrication process for MOSFET [[semiconductor device]]s in VLSI chips. {{As of|2011}}, 99% of IC chips, including most [[digital electronics|digital]], [[analog integrated circuit|analog]] and [[mixed-signal]] ICs, are fabricated using CMOS technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voinigescu |first1=Sorin |title=High-Frequency Integrated Circuits |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9780521873024 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71dHe1yb9jgC&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high [[electronic noise|noise immunity]] and low static [[power consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;

Since one [[transistor]] of the MOSFET pair is always off, the series combination draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much [[waste heat]] as other forms of logic, like [[NMOS logic]] or [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL), which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. These characteristics allow CMOS to integrate a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most widely used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.

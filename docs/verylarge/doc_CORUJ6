The '''Straits Settlements''' were a group of [[British Empire|British]] territories located in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]]. Originally established in [[1826]] as part of the territories controlled by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]], the Straits Settlements came under direct British control as a [[Crown colony]] on 1 April 1867. In 1946, following the end of the [[Second World War]] and the Japanese occupation, the colony was dissolved as part of the Britain's reorganisation of its dependencies in the area.

The Straits Settlements originally consisted of the four individual settlements of [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Malacca]], and [[Manjung|Dinding]]. [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Islands]] were added in 1886. The island of [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]], off the coast of [[Borneo]], was also incorporated into the colony with effect from 1 January 1907, becoming a separate settlement within it in 1912. Most of the territories now form part of [[Malaysia]], from which Singapore separated in 1965.  The Cocos (or Keeling) Islands were transferred to [[Australia]]n control in 1955. Christmas Island was transferred in 1958. Their administration was combined in 1996 to form the [[Australian Indian Ocean Territories]].

==The Settlements==
===Penang and Province Wellesley===
The first settlement was the Penang territory, in 1786. This originally comprised [[Penang Island]], then known as the {{'}}''Prince of Wales Island''{{'}}. This was later extended to encompass an area of the mainland, which became known as [[Province Wellesley]] (now [[Seberang Perai]]). The first grant was in 1800, followed by another in 1831. Further adjustments to Province Wellesley's border were made in 1859, and with the Treaty of Pangkor in 1874.
Province Wellesley, on the mainland opposite the island of Penang, was ceded to Great Britain in 1800 by the Sultan of [[Kedah]], on its northern and eastern border; Perak lies to the south. The boundary with Kedah was rectified by treaty with Siam (now [[Thailand]]) in 1867. It was administered by a district officer, with some assistants, answering to the resident councillor of Penang. Province Wellesley consisted, for the most part, of a fertile plain, thickly populated by Malays, and occupied in some parts by sugar-planters and others engaged in similar agricultural industries and employing Chinese and Tamil labour. About a tenth of the whole area was covered by low hills with thick jungle. Large quantities of rice were grown by the Malay inhabitants, and between October and February, there was snipe-shooting in the paddy fields. A railway from Butterworth, opposite Penang, runs into Perak, and thence via Selangor and Negri Sembilan to Malacca, with an extension via Muar under the rule of the Sultan of Johor, and through the last-named state to Johor Bharu, opposite the island of Singapore.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|981}}

===Singapore===
[[Singapore]] became the site of a British trading post in 1819 after its founder, [[Stamford Raffles]], successfully involved the East India Company in a dynastic struggle for the throne of [[Johore]]. Thereafter the British came to control the entire island of Singapore, which was developed into a thriving colony and port. In 1824 the Dutch conceded any rights they had to the island in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], and by 1836 Singapore was the seat of government of the Straits Settlements.

===Malacca===
The Dutch colony of [[Malacca]] was ceded to the British in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] in exchange for the British possession of [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]] and for British rights in [[Sumatra]]. Malacca's importance was in establishing an exclusive British zone of influence in the region, and it was overshadowed as a trading post by Penang, and later, Singapore.

===Dindings===
The [[Dindings]] — named after the [[Dinding River]] in present-day [[Manjung District]] — which comprised [[Pangkor Island]], and the towns of [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Sitiawan]] on the mainland, were ceded by Perak to the British government under the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874]]. Hopes that its excellent natural harbour would prove to be valuable were doomed to disappointment, and the territory sparsely inhabited and altogether unimportant both politically and financially,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|981}} was returned to and administered by the government of Perak in February 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sejarah Manjung|url=http://www.mpm.gov.my/sejarahmanjung1|website=Laman Web Rasmi Majlis Perbandaran Manjung|publisher=Majlis Perbandaran Manjung|accessdate=18 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127074723/http://www.mpm.gov.my/sejarahmanjung1|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East India Company rule===
The establishment of the Straits Settlements followed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], by which the Malay archipelago was divided into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south. This resulted in the exchange of the British settlement of [[Bengkulu (city)|Bencoolen]] (on Sumatra) for the Dutch colony of [[Malacca]] and undisputed control of Singapore. The Settlements were largely Chinese in population, with a tiny but important [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;''Singapore Free Press'', 3 January 1861&lt;/ref&gt; Their capital was moved from [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], the capital of [[Penang]], to Singapore in 1832. Their scattered nature proved to be difficult and, after the company lost its monopoly in the [[Bone china|china]] trade in 1833, expensive to administer.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, CM (1972) ''The Straits Settlements, 1826–1867: Indian Presidency to Crown Colony'', Athlone Press, London. P3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KITLV - 80020 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Quay in Penang - circa 1910.tif|thumb|The [[Port of Penang]] in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] during the 1910s]]
During their control by the [[East India Company]], the Settlements were used as [[penal settlements]] for Indian civilian and military prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C (2007) ''The Indian Uprising of 1857–8: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion'', Anthem Press. P14&lt;/ref&gt; earning them the title of the &quot;Botany Bays of India&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nicholas and P. R. Shergold, &quot;Transportation as Global Migration&quot;, in S. Nicholas (ed.) (1988) ''Convict Workers: Reinterpreting Australia's Past'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|29}} The years 1852 and 1853 saw minor uprisings by convicts in Singapore and Penang.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, CM, &quot;Convicts in the Straits Settlements 1826–1867&quot; in ''Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1970, 43, 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|91}} Upset with East India Company rule, in 1857 the European population of the Settlements sent a petition to the British Parliament&lt;ref&gt;Petition reprinted in ''Straits Times'', 13 October 1857&lt;/ref&gt; asking for direct rule; but the idea was overtaken by events—the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

When a &quot;Gagging Act&quot; was imposed to prevent the uprising in India spreading, the Settlements' press reacted with anger, classing it as something that subverted &quot;every principle of liberty and free discussion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Straits Times'', 28 July 1857&lt;/ref&gt; As there was little or no vernacular press in the Settlements, such an act seemed irrelevant: it was rarely enforced and ended in less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;Seow, FT (1998) ''The media enthralled: Singapore revisited'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6}}

===Crown Colony status===
On 1 April 1867 the Settlements became a British [[Crown colony]], making the Settlements answerable directly to the [[Colonial Office]] in London instead of the government of [[British Raj|British India]] based in Calcutta. Earlier, on 4 February 1867, [[Letters Patent]] had granted the Settlements a colonial constitution. This allocated much power to the Settlements' [[List of Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor]], who administered the colony of the Straits Settlements with the aid of an [[Executive Council of the Straits Settlements|Executive Council]], composed wholly of official (i.e., ex-officio) members, and a [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements|legislative council]], composed partly of official and partly of nominated members, of which the former had a narrow permanent majority. The work of administration, both in the colony and in the [[Federated Malay States]], was carried on by means of a civil service whose members were recruited by competitive examination held annually in London.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Straits Settlements|last=Clifford|first=Hugh Charles|author-link=Hugh Clifford|volume=25|pages=980–981|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|980}}

Penang and Malacca were administered, directly under the governor, by [[Resident (title)|resident councillors]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|980}}

===Governor's wider role===
In 1886 the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] (which were settled and once owned by a Scottish family named Clunies-Ross) and [[Christmas Island]], formerly attached to [[Ceylon]], were transferred to the care of the government of the Straits Settlements in Singapore. In 1907 the former [[Crown Colony of Labuan]], in Borneo, which for a period was vested in the [[British North Borneo Company]], was resumed by the British government and was vested in the governor of the Straits Settlements.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|980}}

The governor was also [[High Commissioner]] for the Federated Malay States on the peninsula, for [[British North Borneo]], the sultanate of [[Brunei]] and [[Sarawak]] in Borneo. British [[resident (title)|residents]] controlled the native states of Perak, [[Selangor]], [[Negri Sembilan]], and [[Pahang]], but on 1 July 1896, when the federation of these states was effected, a [[resident-general]], responsible to the (governor as) high commissioner, was placed in supreme charge of all the British [[protectorate]]s in the peninsula.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|980}}

===Japanese invasion and dissolution===
During [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded Malaya and the Straits Settlements by landing on [[Kelantan]] on 8 December 1941. On 16 December Penang became the first Straits Settlement to fall into Japanese hands. Malacca fell on 15 January and Singapore fell on 15 February, following the [[Battle of Singapore]]. The Straits Settlements, along with the rest of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|remained under Japanese occupation]] until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|August 1945]].

After the war, the colony was dissolved with effect from 1 April 1946, with [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] becoming a separate Crown colony (and ultimately an independent republic), while Penang and Malacca joined the new [[Malayan Union]] (a predecessor of modern-day [[Malaysia]]). [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] was briefly annexed to Singapore, before being attached to the new colony of British North Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/cf47ce98-0e14-4c1f-a6f7-cb55c99b4df6 | title=The Straits Settlements is Dissolved}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population, which was 306,775 in 1871 and 423,384 in 1881, had in 1901 reached a total of 572,249. As in former years, the increase was solely due to immigration, more especially of Chinese, though a considerable number of Tamils and other natives of India settled in the Straits Settlements. The total number of births registered in the colony in 1900 was 14,814, and the ratio per 1,000 of the population during 1896, 1897, and 1898 respectively was 22–18, 20–82 and 21–57; while the number of registered deaths for the years 1896–1900 gave a ratio per 1000 of 42–21, 36–90, 30–43, 31–66 and 36-25 respectively, the number of deaths registered during 1900 being 23,385. The cause to which the excess of deaths over births is to be attributed is to be found in the fact that the Chinese and Indian population, which numbered 339,083, or over 59 percent of the whole, was composed of 261,412 males and only 77,671 females, and a comparatively small number of the latter were married women and mothers of families. Male Europeans also outnumbered females by about two to one. Among the Malays and Eurasians, who alone had a fair proportion of both sexes, infant mortality was excessive due to early marriages and other causes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|980}}

The number of immigrants landing in the various settlements during 1906 was:
Singapore 176,587 Chinese; Penang 56,333 Chinese and 52,041 natives of India; and Malacca 598 Chinese. The total number of immigrants for 1906 was therefore 285,560, as against 39,136 emigrants, mostly Chinese returning to China. In 1867, the date of the transfer of the colony from the East India Company to the Crown, the total population was estimated at 283,384.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|980}}

In 1939, the population reached 1,370,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=C. Peter |title=Singapore |url=https://ww2db.com/country.php?cid=133 |website=World War II Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finance ==
In the early nineteenth century, the most common currency used in the East Indies was the [[Spanish dollar]], including issues both from Spain and from the new world Spanish colonies, most significantly [[Mexico]]. Locally issued coinages included the [[Kelantan keping|Kelantan]] and [[Trengganu keping]], and the [[Penang dollar]].

In 1837, the [[Indian rupee]] was made the sole official currency in the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as part of [[Company rule in India|India]].

However, Spanish dollars continued to circulate and 1845 saw the introduction of coinage for the Straits Settlements using a system of 100 cents = 1 [[Straits dollar]], with the dollar equal to the Spanish dollar or [[Mexican peso]]. In 1867, the administration of the Straits Settlements was separated from India and the dollar was made the standard currency.

The revenue of the colony in 1868 amounted to $1,301,843. That for 1906 was $9,512,132, exclusive of $106,180 received for land sales. Of this sum, $6,650,558 was derived from import duties on [[opium]], wines, and spirits, and licences to deal in these articles, $377,972 from land revenue, $592,962 from postal and telegraphic revenue, and $276,019 from port and harbour dues.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|981}}

Expenditures, which in 1868 amounted to approximately $1,197,177, rose in 1906 to $8,747,819. The total cost of the administrative establishments amounted to $4,450,791, of which $2,586,195 were personal emoluments and $1,864,596 other charges. The military expenditure (the colony paid on this account 20 percent of its gross revenue to the British government by way of military contribution) amounted in 1906 to $1,762,438; $578,025 was expended on upkeep and maintenance of existing public works, and $1,209,291 on new roads, streets, bridges, and buildings.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{RP|981}}

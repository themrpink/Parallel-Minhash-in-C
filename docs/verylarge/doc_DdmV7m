[[File:Crayones cera.jpg|thumb|right|270px|A selection of colorful crayons]]
A '''crayon''' (or '''wax pastel''') is a stick of [[pigment]]ed [[wax]] used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from [[pastel]]s, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry [[binder (material)|binder]] such as [[gum arabic]], and from [[oil pastel]]s, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil.

Crayons are available at a range of prices and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.

==Composition==
In the modern English-speaking world, the term crayon is commonly associated with the standard wax crayon, such as those widely available for use by children. Such crayons are usually approximately {{convert|3.5|in}} in length and made mostly of [[paraffin wax]]. Paraffin wax is heated and cooled to achieve the correct temperature at which a usable wax substance can be dyed and then manufactured and shipped for use around the world. Paraffin waxes are used for cosmetics, candles, for the preparation of printing ink, fruit preserving, in the pharmaceutical industry, for lubricating purposes, and crayons.&lt;ref&gt;Asinger, F. Paraffins: Chemistry and Technology. Long Island City, NY: English Edition Copyright, 1968. 47. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Snedeker]], a chemist for [[Binney &amp; Smith]] (the then-parent company of [[Crayola]]), developed the first washable crayons in response to consumer complaints regarding stained fabrics and walls.&lt;ref name=weagle&gt;{{cite news|first=Beccy|last=Tanner|title=Chemist who came up with washable crayons dies in Wichita |url=http://www.kansas.com/news/local/news-local-obituaries/article110549337.html |work=[[The Wichita Eagle]] |date=2016-10-26 |access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[patent]] for the washable solid marking composition utilized in the washable crayons was awarded to Snedeker in 1990.&lt;ref name=weagle/&gt;

==History==
[[File:VariousCrayonBoxes.jpg|thumb|A wide variety of crayon boxes have been produced over the years]]
The history of the crayon is not entirely clear. The [[French language|French]] word ''crayon'', originally meaning &quot;chalk pencil&quot;, dates to around the 16th century, and it derives from the word ''craie'' (chalk) which comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''creta'' (Earth).&lt;ref name=&quot;websters&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The notion to combine a form of wax with pigment goes back thousands of years. [[Encaustic painting]] is a technique that uses hot [[beeswax]] combined with colored pigment to bind color into stone. A heat source was then used to &quot;burn in&quot; and fix the image in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;encaustic1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

This method, employed by the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks, and even indigenous people in the [[Philippines]], is still used today. However, the process wasn't used to make crayons into a form intended to be held and colored with and was therefore ineffective to use in a classroom or as crafts for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;encaustic2&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Contemporary crayons are purported to have originated in Europe, where some of the first cylinder shaped crayons were made with charcoal and oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;charcoal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crayola.com/mediacenter/HistoryOfCrayons.doc |title=Crayola Web Site – History of Crayons |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409022027/http://www.crayola.com/mediacenter/HistoryOfCrayons.doc |archive-date=April 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastels are an art medium having roots with the modern crayon and stem back to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1495. [[Conté]] crayons, out of Paris, are a hybrid between a pastel and a conventional crayon, used since the late 1790s as a drawing crayon for artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;conte&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, various hues of powdered pigment eventually replaced the primary charcoal ingredient found in most early 19th century products. References to crayons in literature appear as early as 1813 in Jane Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice''. French lithographer [[Joseph Lemercier]] was also one of the inventors of the modern crayon. Through his Paris business circa 1828, he produced a variety of crayon and color related products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemercier&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Dixon Crayon Ad.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Early Dixon crayon ad from Aug 1901]]
The initial era of wax crayons saw several companies and products competing for the lucrative education and artist markets. The Franklin Mfg. Co, founded in 1876 in [[Rochester, New York]], was one of the first companies to make and sell wax crayons, and in 1883 they appeared with a display of crayons at the [[World's Colombian Exposition]] that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FranklinExpo&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Some of the earliest records of the modern [[paraffin wax]] crayon comes from Charles A. Bowley of  Massachusetts, who developed wax coloring crayons in the late 1880s. Bowley had been selling various [[stationery]] items around the vicinity of Danvers and had developed clumps of colored wax designed for marking [[leather]]. With the need for more accuracy, he went back to his home and formed the wax crayons into more manageable cylinder shapes similar to that of a pencil. He packaged his crayons into decorative boxes and offered them through stationer clients he knew. The demand for his crayons soon exceeded his ability to keep up with production and he partnered with the [[American Crayon Company]], who had been producing chalk crayons, in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowley&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Edwin Binney]] and C. Harold Smith had been long established in the coloring marketplace through Binney's [[Peekskill, New York]], chemical works making [[lampblack]] by burning [[whale]] and [[carbon black]], as well as their [[chalk]] products. In 1902 they developed and introduced the Staonal marking crayon. A year later in 1903, Edwin Binney's wife, Alice Stead Binney, coined the name [[Crayola]] by combining the French word for chalk, ''craie'', with the first part of ''oleaginous'', another name for the paraffin wax used to make the crayon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crayolahist&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Their most recognizable brand was the Crayola &quot;Gold Medal&quot; line in yellow boxes, which referred to one the company earned with their An-du-Septic dustless chalk during the March [[1904 St. Louis World's Fair]]. They used the award to design a new line of crayons featuring the medal on the front of their box.&lt;ref name=&quot;StLouisExpo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlaupp.com/goldmedal.html |title=Gold Medals Louisiana Purchase Exposition 1904 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822175649/http://www.tlaupp.com/goldmedal.html |archive-date=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, they developed and introduced the No. 8 box of eight assorted colors, which became an immediate success; it was even featured on a [[postage stamp]]) in early 1905&lt;ref name=&quot;CrayolaNo&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Hundreds of companies entered the crayon market, but only a few exist today, with Crayola dominating the market in the United States. In all, there were over 300 documented crayon manufacturers in the United States and many more in other countries.

===Today===
[[File:One Made it.jpg|thumb|Crayola crayons]]
Beyond Crayola, other [[brand name]] crayon manufacturers today include [[Rose Art Industries]] and [[Dixon Ticonderoga]], the successor to the American Crayon Company. Numerous suppliers create [[generic brand]] or [[store brand]] crayons. These are typically found in supermarkets.

In 2000 there was concern about potential contamination of [[asbestos]] in many popular brands of crayons after the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' reported in May of that year that they had tests performed finding that three brands of crayons contained asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/headlines/052300-02.htm|title=Major brands of kids' crayons contain asbestos, tests show|author=Andrew Schneider|author2=Carol Smith|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 19, 2009|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061550/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/052300-02.htm|archive-date=May 25, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up study released in June the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) found traces of asbestos fibers in three crayons and larger amounts of transitional fibers which can be misinterpreted as asbestos&lt;!-- probably need to cite here somehow that these fibers are often mistaken for asbestos, see http://www.olympus-sis.com/en/6900_6928.htm --&gt; as a result of using talc as a binding agent in additional crayons. CPSC declared the risk to be low, but said that because of the concerns it had asked manufacturers to reformulate the concerned crayons and commended them for their swift agreement to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPSC Releases Test Results on Crayons, Industry to reformulate|url=http://cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml00/00123.html|date=June 13, 2000|access-date=December 19, 2009|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721033913/http://cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml00/00123.html|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/foia00/os/crayons.pdf|title=CPSC Staff Report on Asbestos Fibers in Children's Crayons|date=August 2000|access-date=2009-11-18|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826233121/http://www.cpsc.gov/library/foia/foia00/os/crayons.pdf|archive-date=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/crayons.asp|title=Crayon Me a River|date=December 31, 2005|access-date=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Early French artists, including [[Francois Clouet]] (1510-1572) and [[Nicholas L'agneau]] (1590-1666), used crayons in their early art projects. Clouet used crayons for his modeled portraits, which were so elaborate that he caught the attention of Henry V, who knighted him. He became a court painter for the royalty, and his entire art career began and consisted of some wax crayon art. L'agneau illustrated his portraits with outlines in wax crayons, and with tints of watercolor. His portraits were often of people who looked surprised or unaware of their surroundings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Girdler, Reynolds 1967&quot;/&gt;

[[Gertrude Morgan|Sister Gertrude Morgan]] was most known for preaching the Gospel around New Orleans with simplicity and easy-to-understand crayon drawings. Morgan caught the eye of a gallery owner [[Larry Borenstein|E. Lorenz Borenstein]], and was allowed to show her work, play her music and spread her word of God at the gallery. Her early drawings were that of just very modest and simplicity crayon drawings, depicting biblical text to provide a clearer image to those who were unfamiliar with the Bible. Morgan went on to publish a record of her biblical songs and has artwork featured in the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;MORGAN, SISTER GERTRUDE (1900-1980).&quot; The Encyclopedia of American Folk Art.

'''West Ham United Football Club''' is an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], [[East London]]. They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club plays at the [[London Stadium]], having moved from their former home the [[Boleyn Ground]] in 2016.

The club was founded in 1895 as [[Thames Ironworks F.C.|Thames Ironworks]] and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. They moved to the Boleyn Ground in 1904, which remained their home ground for more than a century. The team initially competed in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[Western Football League|Western League]] before joining the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1919. They were promoted to the top flight in 1923, when they were also losing finalists in the first [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. In 1940, the club won the inaugural [[Football League War Cup]].

West Ham have been winners of the [[FA Cup]] three times; in [[1964 FA Cup Final|1964]], [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]], and have also been runners-up twice; in [[1923 FA Cup Final|1923]] and [[2006 FA Cup Final|2006]]. The club have reached two major European finals, winning the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1964–65 European Cup Winners' Cup|1965]] and finishing runners-up in the same competition in [[1975–76 European Cup Winners' Cup|1976]]. West Ham also won the [[Intertoto Cup]] in 1999. They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 62 of 94 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the [[2019-20 Premier League|2019-20 season]]. The club's highest league position to date came in [[1985–86 Football League|1985–86]], when they achieved third place in the then [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

Three West Ham players were members of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] final-winning [[England national football team|England]] team: captain [[Bobby Moore]] and goalscorers [[Sir Geoff Hurst|Geoff Hurst]] and [[Martin Peters]]. The club has a [[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|long-standing rivalry]] with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. West Ham adopted their [[claret]] and [[sky blue]] colour scheme in the early 1900's, with the most common iteration of a claret shirt and sky blue sleeves first emerging in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/West_Ham_United/West_Ham_United.htm|title=West Ham United - Historical Football Kits|publisher=Historicalkits|access-date=11 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of West Ham United F.C.}}

===Origins===
{{main|Thames Ironworks F.C.}}
[[File:ThamesIronworksFC.gif|thumb|right|200px|Earliest club shot, during its founding year as Thames Ironworks in 1895]]
The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as [[Thames Ironworks F.C.]], the [[works team]] of the largest and last surviving shipbuilder on the Thames, [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]], by foreman and local league referee [[Dave Taylor (Thames Ironworks F.C. founder)|Dave Taylor]] and owner [[Arnold Hills]]&lt;ref name=Spartacus1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WHhistory1.htm|title=The History of West Ham United 1895–1896|publisher=Spartacus Educational|access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was announced in the ''Thames Ironworks Gazette'' of June 1895. Thames Ironworks was based in [[Leamouth|Leamouth Wharf]] in [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Canning Town]] on both banks of the [[River Lea]], where the [[River Lea|Lea]] meets the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Thames Ironworks built many ships and other structures, the most famous being {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}. The last ship built there was the [[dreadnought]] {{HMS|Thunderer|1911|6}} in 1912 and the yard shut soon after.

The repair yard of the [[Union-Castle Line|Castle Shipping Line]] was a very near neighbour and their work team, initially known as the [[Old Castle Swifts F.C.|Castle Swifts]], would informally merge with the Thames Ironworks own team.

The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees. Thomas Freeman was a ships fireman and Walter Parks, a clerk. [[Johnny Stewart (footballer, born 1872)|Johnny Stewart]], [[Walter Tranter]] and [[Jamie Lindsay (footballer, born 1870)|James Lindsay]] were all boilermakers. Other employees included William Chapman, [[George Sage (footballer)|George Sage]] and Fred Chamberlain, as well as apprentice riveter [[Charlie Dove]], who was to have a great influence on the club's future at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=West Ham: A Nostalgic Look at a Century of the Club| publisher=Haynes Publishing| first=Iain| last=Dale| isbn=978-0-857330-45-1| page=10| date=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thames Ironworks won the [[West Ham Charity Cup]], contested by clubs in the [[West Ham]] locality, in 1895, then won the [[London League (football)|London League]] in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats1&quot;&gt;'{{cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/THAMEIRO.HTM | title= Source for Thames Ironworks statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats1&quot;/&gt;

The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University &quot;[[University Sporting Blue|Blue]],&quot; but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn through 1897 to 1899.

Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club, in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded, then almost immediately relaunched on 5 July 1900 as West Ham United F.C. with [[Syd King]] as their manager and future manager [[Charlie Paynter]] as his assistant. Because of the original &quot;works team&quot; roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as &quot;the Irons&quot; or &quot;the Hammers&quot; amongst fans and the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;EastLon&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/thames%20ironworks.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213220605/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/thames%20ironworks.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=13 February 2006 | title=East London History regarding Thames Ironworks | publisher=EastLondonHistory.com | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All%20abstracts.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117001255/http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All%20abstracts.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=17 January 2005 | title=Pg24, citing study into West Hams community ties | publisher=Leeds Metropolitan University | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of West Ham United (1901–1961)===
West Ham United joined the Western League for the 1901 season&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats2&quot;&gt;'{{cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/W-HAMU.HTM | title=Source for West Ham statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | access-date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1. In 1907, West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1–0 to become the Western League Overall Champions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats2&quot;/&gt; The reborn club continued to play their games at the [[Memorial Grounds]] in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a [[Association football pitch|pitch]] in the Upton Park area in the guise of the [[Boleyn Ground]] stadium in 1904. West Ham's first game in their new home was against fierce [[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry|rivals]] [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 3–0 winners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Northcutt| first =John |author2=Roy Shoesmith | title =West Ham United: A Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books | year =1993 | location =Derby | page =198 | isbn =978-1-873626-44-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote on 2 September 1904, &quot;Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning, West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park.&quot;

[[File:Whitehorsefinal.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Billie'' the White Horse, saviour of the 1923 [[FA Cup]] Final]]
In 1919, still under King's leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the [[Football League Second Division]], their first game being a 1–1 draw with [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], and were promoted to [[Division One]] in 1923, also making it to the first ever [[FA Cup Final]] to be held at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley stadium]]. Their opponents were [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. This was also known as the [[White Horse Final]], so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by &quot;Billie,&quot; a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by [[Constable|PC]] [[George Scorey]]. The Cup Final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;1933semi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&amp;ham=1282&amp;united=18_Mar_1933 | title=Game played on 18 March 1933 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the club was relegated to Division Two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1932&amp;united=1st_Division_1931-32 | title=1st Division 1931–32 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long term custodian [[Syd King]] was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38foEpwni4C&amp;q=syd+king+sacked+west+ham&amp;pg=PT12 | title=The Manager: The absurd ascent of the most important man in football | publisher=Hachette Digital | access-date=5 October 2013 | author=Ronay, Barney| isbn=9780748117703 | date=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced with his assistant manager [[Charlie Paynter]], who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player [[Ted Fenton]].

Fenton succeeded in getting the club once again promoted to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player [[Malcolm Allison]], Fenton helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham's approach to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101015/malcolm-allison-1927-2010_2236884_2185790 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025141806/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101015/malcolm-allison-1927-2010_2236884_2185790 | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 October 2010 | title=Malcolm Allison 1927–2010 | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=15 October 2010 | access-date=5 October 2013 | author=Helliar, John | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ted Fenton biography|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WHfentonT.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of West ham United|url=http://espnfc.com/feature/_/id/841093?cc=4716|publisher=ESPN|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tributes pour in for Bond|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120926/tributes-pour-in-for-bond_2236884_2930511|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928030453/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120926/tributes-pour-in-for-bond_2236884_2930511|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 September 2012|publisher=West Ham United|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glory years (1961–1978)===
[[Ron Greenwood]] was appointed as Fenton's successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies, winning the [[1964 FA Cup Final]]. The team was led by the young [[Bobby Moore]]. West Ham also won the [[1965 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-managers-how-roy-hodgsons-predecessors-fared-7703923.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4 | title=England managers: How Roy Hodgson's predecessors fared | work=The Independent | access-date=4 October 2013 | location=London | date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/1447218.stm | title=Obituary: Ron Greenwood | work=BBC Sport | access-date=4 October 2013 | date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], key members of the tournament winners [[England national football team|England]] were West Ham players, including the captain, [[Bobby Moore]]; [[Martin Peters]] (who scored in the final); and [[Geoff Hurst]], who scored the first, and only, [[hat-trick]] in a men's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] final.&lt;ref name=rg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100531/world-cup-hammers_2236884_2059863 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603135903/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100531/world-cup-hammers_2236884_2059863 | url-status=dead | archive-date=3 June 2010 | title=World Cup Hammers | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=4 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130222/bonzo-pays-tribute-to-bobby_2236884_3084197 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221506/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130222/bonzo-pays-tribute-to-bobby_2236884_3084197 | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 October 2013 | title=Bonzo plays tribute | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:champions statue.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Champions statue on Barking Road]]
There is a &quot;Champions&quot; statue in [[Barking Road]], opposite The [[Boleyn Tavern]], commemorating West Ham's &quot;three sons&quot; who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Also included on the statue is [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newham.com/work/attractions/champions_sculpture/33,10,0,0.html | title=Champions Sculpture | publisher=London Borough of Newham  | date=14 January 2008| access-date=4 October 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005040852/http://www.newham.com/work/attractions/champions_sculpture/33,10,0,0.html | archive-date=5 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
They also won the [[FA Cup]] in 1975 by defeating [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] 2–0. The Fulham team had former England [[captain (association football)|captains]] [[Alan Mullery]] and West Ham legend [[Bobby Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hammers nail Fulham|url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham|publisher=The FA|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a difficult start to the 1974–75 season, Greenwood moved himself &quot;upstairs&quot; to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant [[John Lyall]] as team manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4922314.stm | title=Former West Ham boss Lyall dies | work=BBC Sport | access-date=4 October 2013 | date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games combined and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 2–0 in the 1975 final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120517/hammerabilia-wembley-special_2236884_2774289 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221516/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120517/hammerabilia-wembley-special_2236884_2774289 | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 October 2013 | title=Hammeralelia Wembley special | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyall then guided West Ham to another [[1976 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]] final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4–2 to Belgian side [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071018/anderlecht-deny-european-repeat_2236895_1328709 | title=Anderlecht deny European repeat | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=4 October 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207000829/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071018/anderlecht-deny-european-repeat_2236895_1328709 | archive-date=7 December 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwood's tenure as general manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of [[Don Revie]]'s resignation in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;exitrevie&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Staff/RonGreenwood | title=Ron Greenwood | publisher=The Football Association | access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ups and downs (1978–2005)===
In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to Division Two, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to an [[FA Cup Final 1980|FA Cup Final]] win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1980, their last major honour.  They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Ham 1 Everton 1|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1980-04-18&amp;fromDate=1980-04-17&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=Everton&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1980-04-17-12&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1980-04-17-12-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=2&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=17&amp;date_mm_From=04&amp;date_yyyy_From=1980&amp;date_dd_to_range=18&amp;date_mm_to_range=04&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1980&amp;date_dd_from_precise=17&amp;date_mm_from_precise=04&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1980&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText=|work=The Times|access-date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hammers won 1–0, with a goal scored from a header by [[Trevor Brooking]] in the 13th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When the Hammers shocked Arsenal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/8435400.stm|work=BBC Sport|access-date=4 October 2013|first=Chris|last=Bevan|date=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since. West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86; a group of players which came to be known as [[The Boys of 86]]. However, they suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall's sacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Welch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/20/guardianobituaries.mainsection1 |title=Obituary John Lyall |work=The Guardian |date= 20 April 2006|access-date=29 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an ''ex gratia'' payment of £100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as &quot;upsetting&quot; circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Nearly Reached the Sky | publisher=Football World | author=Blowers, Steve | year=2005 | page=18 | isbn=978-0-9548336-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WestHamUtdFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Yearly performance of West Ham since joining the Football League]]

After Lyall, [[Lou Macari]] briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/Person.asp?PersonID=MACARILO | title=Lou Macari | publisher=swindon-town-fc.co.uk | access-date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was replaced by former player [[Billy Bonds]].&lt;ref name=essential&gt;{{cite book | title=The Essential History of West Ham United | publisher=Headline Book publishing | author=Blows, Kirk | year=2000 | page=193 | isbn=978-0-7472-7036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bonds' first full season, [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]], West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a [[Debenture (sport)|bond scheme]], there was crowd unrest.

With the team in the Premier League, there was a need to rebuild the team. [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] player [[Joey Beauchamp]] was recruited for a fee of £1.2&amp;nbsp;million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldseries.co.uk/sport/oxfordunited/unitednews/8220434.I_was_sold_to_save_United_says_Beauchamp/ |title=I was sold to save United says Beauchamp |publisher=Heraldseries.co.uk |date=22 June 1994 |access-date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender [[Adrian Whitbread]] going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-coventry-ask-babb-bidders-to-raise-offers-liverpool-made-to-wait-1377205.html|title=Coventry ask Babb bidders to raise offers Liverpool made to wait|work=The Independent|access-date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant manager [[Harry Redknapp]] was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]] being prepared to offer him a position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.football-england.com/billy_bonds.html | title=Billy Bonds | publisher=football-england.com | access-date=18 August 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703155116/http://www.football-england.com/billy_bonds.html | archive-date=3 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the West Ham board and their managing director, [[Peter Storrie]], made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club—on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMTHOTB146&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Bring Me the Head of Trevor Brooking | publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company | author=Blow, Kirk | year=2010 | location=Edinburgh | page=136 | isbn=978-1-84596-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMTHOTB146&quot;/&gt; Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, &quot;If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation.

Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994.&lt;ref name=14m&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=2802&amp;teamTabs=managers | title=Soccerbase – West Ham managers | publisher=soccerbase.com | access-date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redknapp's time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16&amp;nbsp;million, despite the £18&amp;nbsp;million sale of [[Rio Ferdinand]] to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fees&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/redknapp-blamed-for-west-ham-loss-6353787.html | title=Redknapp blamed for West Ham loss | work=London Evening Standard | date=8 November 2001 | access-date=14 August 2013 | author=Dyer, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were notably successful, such as the signings of [[Stuart Pearce]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Trevor Sinclair]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Paolo Di Canio]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[John Hartson]],&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Eyal Berkovic]]&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; and [[Ian Wright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wrightwrightwright&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/news/131949.stm | title=Sport: Football: News | work=BBC Sport | access-date=18 August 2013 | date=13 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as [[Florin Raducioiu]];&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Davor Šuker]], who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Christian Bassila]], who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Titi Camara]]; [[Gary Charles]], whose wages amounted to £4.4&amp;nbsp;million but made only three starts for the club;&lt;ref name=fees/&gt; [[Rigobert Song]]; [[Paulo Futre]];&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; and [[Marco Boogers]],&lt;ref name=hr&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1321837.stm | title=Harry Leaves his legacy | work=BBC Sport | date=9 May 2001 | access-date=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport16 | title=The 10 worst foreign signings of all time | journal=The Guardian | date=6 August 2000 | access-date=18 August 2013 | author=Hills, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1995&amp;united=Premier_League_1994-95 | title=Premier League 1994–95 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and [[Paul Kitson]] who added the impetus needed at the season's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&amp;ham=1997&amp;united=Premier_League_1996-97 | title=Premier League 1996–97 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, West Ham finished fifth, their highest position in the top flight since 1986.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; They also won the [[Intertoto Cup]] beating French club [[FC Metz|Metz]] to qualify for the [[1999–2000 UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intertotocupwin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130824/on-this-day-24-august_2236884_3435367 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827112441/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130824/on-this-day-24-august_2236884_3435367 | url-status=dead | archive-date=27 August 2013 | title=On this day – 24 August | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=5 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Things began to falter for Redknapp with the sale for £18&amp;nbsp;million to Leeds of Rio Ferdinand in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as [[Ragnvald Soma]], who cost £800,000 and played only seven league games, Camara, and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market.&lt;ref name=&quot;cash&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1321273.stm | title=Cash row key to Redknapp exit | work=BBC Sport | date=12 May 2001 | access-date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman [[Terry Brown (football chairman)|Brown]] lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds.

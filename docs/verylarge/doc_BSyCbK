On his return to London, the king was confronted by Gloucester, Arundel and [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]], who brought an [[Criminal appeal|appeal]]{{Ref label|D|d|none}} of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, [[Nicholas Brembre]], and [[Alexander Neville]], the [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements.&lt;ref name=&quot;S187&quot;&gt;Saul (1997), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The three peers then joined forces with Gaunt's son [[Henry Bolingbroke]], Earl of Derby, and [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham]]{{spaced ndash}}the group known to history as the [[Lords Appellant]]. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at [[Battle of Radcot Bridge|Radcot Bridge]], where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole{{spaced ndash}}who had by now also left the country&lt;ref name=&quot;S187&quot;/&gt;{{spaced ndash}}were sentenced to death ''in absentia'' at the [[Merciless Parliament]] in February 1388.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, as a man of the clergy, was deprived of his [[temporalities]], also ''in absentia''; Saul (1997), pp. 192–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;

== A fragile peace ==
[[File:Silver halfpenny of (Richard II YORYM 1980 1578) obverse.jpg|thumb|Silver half penny of Richard II, [[York Museums Trust]]]]
Richard gradually re-established royal authority in the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a [[Battle of Otterburn|Scottish incursion]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name.&lt;ref name=&quot;S203-4&quot;&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 203–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;S203-4&quot;/&gt; Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isabela richard2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richard and Isabella on their wedding day. She was six; he was twenty-nine.]]

With national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English Crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 215–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.&lt;ref&gt;(As it turned out, she never did produce an heir: just four years later, Richard was dead.) McKisack (1959), p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English [[Lordship of Ireland|lordships in Ireland]] were in danger of being overrun by the Gaelic Irish kingdoms, and the [[Normans in Ireland|Anglo-Irish]] lords were pleading for the king to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened his support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;

== Second crisis of 1397–99 ==
The period that historians refer to as the &quot;tyranny&quot; of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 371–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386–88 and eliminate them as threats to his power.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 378–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel's brother [[Thomas Arundel]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting [[retinue|retainers]] for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Johnofgaunt.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John of Gaunt]] had been at the centre of English politics for over thirty years, and his death in 1399 led to insecurity.]]

These actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt, but with the support of a large group of other magnates, many of whom were rewarded with new titles, who were disparagingly referred to as Richard's &quot;duketti&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saul (2005), p. 63.&quot;&gt;Saul (2005), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the former Appellants [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby]], who was made [[Duke of Hereford]], and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, who was created [[Duke of Norfolk]]. Also among them were [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter|John]] and [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|Thomas Holland]], the king's half-brother and nephew, who were promoted from earls of [[Earl of Huntingdon|Huntingdon]] and [[Earl of Kent|Kent]] to dukes of [[Duke of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[Duke of Surrey|Surrey]] respectively; the king's cousin [[Edward of Norwich, Earl of Rutland]], who received Gloucester's French title of [[Duke of Aumale]]; Gaunt's son [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], who was made [[Marquess of Somerset]] and [[Marquess of Dorset]]; [[John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]]; and [[Thomas Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Lord Thomas le Despenser]], who became [[Earl of Gloucester]].{{Ref label|E|e|none}} With the forfeited lands of the convicted appellants, the king could reward these men with lands suited to their new ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;M483-4&quot;&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 483–4&lt;/ref&gt;

A threat to Richard's authority still existed, however, in the form of the [[House of Lancaster]], represented by John of Gaunt and his son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford. The House of Lancaster not only possessed greater wealth than any other family in England, they were of royal descent and, as such, likely candidates to succeed the childless Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 196–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Discord broke out in the inner circles of court in December 1397, when Bolingbroke&lt;ref name=&quot;M483-4&quot;/&gt; and Mowbray became embroiled in a quarrel. According to Bolingbroke, Mowbray had claimed that the two, as former Lords Appellant, were next in line for royal retribution. Mowbray vehemently denied these charges, as such a claim would have amounted to treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saul (2005), p. 63.&quot;/&gt; A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle, but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt died. Rather than allowing Bolingbroke to succeed, Richard extended the term of his exile to life and expropriated his properties.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 403–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The king felt safe from Bolingbroke, who was residing in Paris, since the French had little interest in any challenge to Richard and his peace policy.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard left the country in May for another expedition in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1398 Richard summoned the Parliament of Shrewsbury, which declared all the acts of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally be put on the king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Samuel R.

== Court culture ==

In the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as &quot;[[highness]]&quot;, now &quot;royal [[majesty]]&quot;, or &quot;high majesty&quot; were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 340–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that his father had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 344–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), pp. 489–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard rejected the approach his grandfather Edward III had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), pp. 490–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France.&lt;ref name=&quot;S439&quot;&gt;Saul (1997), p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them [[livery]] [[heraldic badge|badges]] with his [[White Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 332, 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patronage and the arts ==
As part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image. Unlike any other English king before him, he had himself portrayed in [[panel painting]]s of elevated majesty,&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; of which two survive: an over life-size [[Westminster Abbey]] portrait (c.&amp;nbsp;1390), and the [[Wilton Diptych]] (1394–99), a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135. See also Levey, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few surviving English examples of the courtly [[International Gothic]] style of painting that was developed in the courts of the Continent, especially Prague and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's expenditure on jewellery, rich textiles and metalwork was far higher than on paintings, but as with his [[illuminated manuscript]]s, there are hardly any surviving works that can be connected with him, except for a crown, &quot;one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith&quot;, that probably belonged to his wife Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–3 and 506. It is documented in the royal collection from 1399 and accompanied Blanche, daughter of Henry IV, to her Bavarian marriage. It is still in Munich.

Among Richard's grandest projects in the field of architecture was [[Westminster Hall]], which was extensively rebuilt during his reign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brown, R. A.|editor2=H. M. Colvin|editor3=A. J. Taylor|title=History of the King's Work|publisher=[[HMSO]]|location=London|year=1963|volume=i|pages=527–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps spurred on by the completion in 1391 of John of Gaunt's magnificent hall at [[Kenilworth Castle]]. Fifteen life-size statues of kings were placed in niches on the walls, and the [[hammer-beam]] roof by the royal carpenter [[Hugh Herland]], &quot;the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture&quot;, allowed the original three [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space, with a dais at the end for Richard to sit in solitary state.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;506–7 and 515. Only six of the statues remain, rather damaged, and the dais has been remodelled, but otherwise the hall remains largely as Richard and his architect [[Henry Yevele]] left it.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding had been begun by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1245, but had by Richard's time been dormant for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's patronage of literature is especially important, because this was the period in which the English language took shape as a [[Middle English literature#Late period|literary language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to patronage of [[English poetry#The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages|poetry]], but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 361–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest poet of the age, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], served the king as a diplomat, a customs official and a clerk of [[Office of Works|The King's Works]] while producing some of his best-known work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Benson|editor-first=Larry D.|title=The Riverside Chaucer|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1988|edition=3rd|pages=xi–xxii|isbn=0-19-282109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' as a eulogy to Gaunt's wife [[Blanche of Lancaster|Blanche]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson (1988), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer's colleague and friend [[John Gower]] wrote his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 362, 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Downfall ==
[[File:Bolingbroke-richard-flint-castle-harley-ms-1319 (cropped).png|thumb|left|Richard's surrender to Henry at [[Flint Castle]]]]
In June 1399, [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]], gained control of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of ''rapprochement'' with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, and for this reason he found it opportune to allow Henry Bolingbroke to leave for England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 406–7.&lt;/ref&gt; With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at [[Ravenspur]] in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Men from all over the country soon rallied around him. Meeting with [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 408–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Bolingbroke experienced little resistance as he moved south. Keeper of the Realm [[Edmund, Duke of York]], had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 486–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his way to [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]], where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Henry Bolingbroke at [[Flint Castle]], promising to abdicate if his life were spared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/richard2.htm|title=Richard II, King of England (1367–1400)|publisher=Luminarium.org|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was by now fully determined to take the throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 494–5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], great-grandson of Edward III's second surviving son, [[Lionel, Duke of Clarence]]. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's third son to survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 419–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct ''male'' line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother, [[Philippa of Clarence]].{{Ref label|F|f|none}}
[[File:Abdikace Richarda2.png|thumb|Richard surrendering the crown to Henry]]
According to the official record, read by the Archbishop of Canterbury during an assembly of [[House of Lords#History|lords]] and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September, Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the ''Traison et Mort Chronicle'' suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while Henry refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.&lt;ref name = kingsmadeengland&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Jones|title=The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England|chapter=Richard Alone|publisher=[[HarperPress]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-00-721392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When parliament met to discuss Richard's fate, [[John Trevor (died 1410)|John Trevor]], Bishop of St Asaph, read thirty-three articles of deposition that were unanimously accepted by lords and commons. On 1 October 1399, Richard II was formally deposed. On 13 October, the feast day of [[Edward the Confessor]], Henry Bolingbroke was crowned king.&lt;ref name = kingsmadeengland/&gt;

== Death ==
Henry had agreed to let Richard live after his abdication. This all changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent, and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutland{{spaced ndash}}all now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richard{{spaced ndash}}were planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the [[Epiphany Rising]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 424–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live. He is thought to have been starved to death in captivity in [[Pontefract Castle]] on or around 14 February 1400, although there is some question over the date and manner of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in [[old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] on 17 February before burial in [[King's Langley Priory]] on 6 March.

Rumours that Richard was still alive persisted, but never gained much credence in England;&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came into the hands of [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]], lodged in [[Stirling Castle]], and serving as the notional{{spaced ndash}}and perhaps reluctant{{spaced ndash}}figurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and [[Lollard]] intrigues in England. Henry IV's government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources from both sides of the Border suggest the man had a mental illness, one also describing him as a &quot;beggar&quot; by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in the local [[Dominican friary]] in Stirling. Meanwhile, in 1413, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]{{spaced ndash}}in an effort both to atone for his father's act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard's survival{{spaced ndash}}had decided to have the body at King's Langley moved to its final resting place in Westminster Abbey. Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 428–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and assessment ==
Contemporary writers, even those less sympathetic to the king, agreed that Richard was a &quot;most beautiful king&quot;, though with a &quot;face which was white, rounded and feminine&quot;, implying he lacked manliness.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; He was athletic and tall; when his tomb was opened in 1871 he was found to be six feet (1.82 m) tall.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 451–2, quoting [[John Gower]] and ''Historia vitae et regni Ricardi II''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also intelligent and well read, and when agitated he had a tendency to stammer.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Westminster Abbey portrait probably shows a good similarity of the king, the Wilton Diptych portrays him as significantly younger than he was at the time; it must be assumed that he had a beard by this point.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 450–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Religiously, he was orthodox, and particularly towards the end of his reign he became a strong opponent of the Lollard heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 297–303.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly devoted to the cult of Edward the Confessor, and around 1395 he had his own [[coat of arms]] [[impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with the [[attributed arms|mythical arms]] of the Confessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; Though not a warrior king like his grandfather, Richard nevertheless enjoyed [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]], as well as hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 452–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Richard II from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|Anonymous artist's impression of Richard II in the 16th century. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]

The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by [[Shakespeare]]'s play about the king, ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions, basing his play on works by writers such as [[Edward Hall]] and [[Samuel Daniel]], who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), pp. 11–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Aston|title=Lollards and Reformers: Images and Literacy in Late Medieval Religion|chapter=Richard II and the Wars of the Roses|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1984|pages=273–312|isbn=0-907628-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Richard was to blame for the later-15th century [[Wars of the Roses]] was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.J.|last=Pollard|authorlink=A.

Richard's mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century. One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was [[Bishop Stubbs]]. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind &quot;was losing its balance altogether&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stubbs|first=William|authorlink=William Stubbs|title=The Constitutional History of England|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1875|volume=vol. ii|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Anthony Steel (historian)|Anthony Steel]], who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1941), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged by [[V. H. Galbraith]], who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=V. H.|authorlink=Vivian Hunter Galbraith|year=1942|title=A new life of Richard II|journal=[[History (journal)|History]]|volume=xxvi|pages=223–39|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1942.tb00807.x|issue=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as [[Anthony Goodman (historian)|Anthony Goodman]] and [[Anthony Tuck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt; [[Nigel Saul]], who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes that{{spaced ndash}}even though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illness{{spaced ndash}}he showed clear signs of a [[narcissistic personality]], and towards the end of his reign &quot;Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 460–4&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure. His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern absolute monarchy as exemplified by the [[Tudor dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Walker|editor=Rowena E. Archer|editor2=G. L. Harriss|editor3=Simon Walker|chapter=Richard IIs Views on Kingship|title=Rulers and Ruled in Late Medieval England|page=49|location=London|publisher=[[Hambledon Press]]|year=1995|isbn=1-85285-133-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Richard's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents, and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;W63&quot;&gt;Walker (1995), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his actions were too extreme, and too abrupt. For one, the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation, and so help Richard's popularity with the Commons in parliament. However, this promise was never fulfilled, as the cost of the royal retinue, the opulence of court and Richard's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been, without offering commensurate benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;S439&quot;/&gt; As for his policy of military retaining, this was later emulated by [[Edward IV]] and Henry VII, but Richard II's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 440, 444–5&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Simon Walker (historian)|Simon Walker]] concludes: &quot;What he sought was, in contemporary terms, neither unjustified nor unattainable; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;W63&quot;/&gt;

{{refbegin|30em}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}}John of Gaunt's brother [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund of Langley]] was only one year younger, but it has been suggested that this prince was of &quot;limited ability&quot;, and he took less part in government than Gaunt did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tuck|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Tuck|title=Edmund, first duke of York (1341–1402)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/16023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}}It has been speculated that the whole incident surrounding the killing of Wat Tyler was in fact planned in advance by the council, in order to end the rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 71–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}}While both England and the Empire supported [[Pope Urban VI]] in Rome, the French sided with the [[Avignon Papacy]] of [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}}This &quot;appeal&quot;{{spaced ndash}}which would give its name to the [[Lords Appellant]]{{spaced ndash}}was not an appeal in the modern sense of an application to a higher authority. In medieval [[common law]] the appeal was criminal charge, often one of treason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50010618|title=appeal, ''n.''|publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|accessdate=25 August 2008|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}}Beaufort was the oldest of John of Gaunt's children with [[Katherine Swynford]]; illegitimate children whom Richard had given legitimate status in 1390. He was made [[Marquess of Dorset]]; [[marquess]] being a relatively new title in England up until this point. Rutland, heir to the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Duke of York]], was created [[Counts and Dukes of Aumale|Duke of Aumale]]. Montacute had succeeded [[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|his uncle]] as [[Earl of Salisbury]] earlier the same year. Despenser, the great-grandson of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s favourite who was executed for treason in 1326, was given the forfeited [[Earl of Gloucester|earldom of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 381–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}}Though it had become established tradition for earldoms to descend in the male line, there was no such tradition for royal [[Succession to the British throne|succession in England]]. The precedence could indeed be seen to invalidate the English claim to the French throne, based on succession through the female line, over which the [[Hundred Years' War]] was being fought.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works: local, regional, national, or international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vakil|first=Anna|date=December 1997|title=Confronting the classification problem: Toward a taxonomy of NGOs|journal=World Development|volume=25|issue=12|pages=2057–2070|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00098-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
NGOs may be classified by their orientation and level of operation.

=== {{anchor|By orientation}}Orientation ===

* ''Service'': Includes NGOs which provide healthcare (including family planning) and education.
* ''Participation'': Self-help projects with local involvement in the form of money, tools, land, materials, or labor
* ''Empowerment'': Aim to help poor people understand the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to increase awareness of their power to control their lives.

NGOs further the political or social goals of their members (or founders): improving the [[natural environment]], encouraging the observance of [[human rights]], improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. Their goals cover a wide range of issues.

The [[World Bank]] classifies NGO activity as operational and advocacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. They mobilize resources to provide goods and services to people who have been affected by a natural disaster; they drive change, and partner with other organizations to tackle problems and address human needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last1=Lewis|first1=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NGOs vary by method; some are primarily [[advocacy group]]s, and others conduct programs and activities. [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to obtain food and [[drinking water]]; the [[Forum for Fact-finding Documentation and Advocacy]] (FFDA) helps provide legal assistance to victims of human-rights abuses. The [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]] provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations. Management techniques are crucial to project success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 &lt;!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --&gt; LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah.

=== Operational ===
Operational NGOs seek to &quot;achieve small-scale change directly through projects&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot; WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt; mobilizing financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create local programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. Operational NGOs often have a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; their headquarters are staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report to and communicate with operational fieldworkers on projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt; They are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs may be subdivided into relief or development organizations, service-delivery or participatory, religious or secular, and public or private. Although operational NGOs may be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of an operational NGO is the implementation of projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt;

=== Campaigning ===
Campaigning NGOs seek to &quot;achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through the influence of the political system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot; WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt; They require an active, efficient group of professional members who can keep supporters informed and motivated. Campaigning NGOs must plan and host demonstrations and events which will attract media, their defining activity.&lt;ref name=&quot; WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt; Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues related to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights, and their primary purpose is to defend (or promote) a specific cause.&lt;ref name=&quot; WillettsCS-NTWKS&quot; /&gt;

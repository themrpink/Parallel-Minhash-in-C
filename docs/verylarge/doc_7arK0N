And the one who does not know to ask is told, &quot;It is because of what the Almighty did for me when I left Egypt.&quot;

Some modern Haggadahs mention &quot;children&quot; instead of &quot;sons&quot;, and some have added a fifth child. The fifth child can represent the children of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] who did not survive to ask a question&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haggadot.com/clips/csjo-fifth-child |title=CSJO: Fifth Child |publisher=Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations |accessdate=2011-10-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or represent [[Jews]] who have drifted so far from Jewish life that they do not participate in a Seder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |title=Jewish Holidays &gt; Pesach |publisher=Kolel |accessdate=2011-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108024133/http://www.kolel.org/pages/holidays/Pesach_fourchildren.html |archive-date=2011-11-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the former, tradition is to say that for that child we ask &quot;Why?&quot; and, like the simple child, we have no answer.

==== &quot;Go and learn&quot; ====
Four verses in [[Deuteronomy]] (26:5–8) are then expounded, with an elaborate, traditional commentary. (&quot;5. And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God: 'A wandering Aramean was my parent, and they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous. 6. And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt [[with a strong hand and an outstretched arm]], and with great terribleness, and with [[signs and wonders|signs, and with wonders]].&quot;)

The Haggadah explores the meaning of those verses, and embellishes the story. This telling describes the slavery of the Jewish people and their miraculous salvation by God. This culminates in an enumeration of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues]]:

# ''Dam'' (blood) – All the water was changed to blood
# ''Tzefardeyah'' (frogs) – An infestation of frogs sprang up in Egypt
# ''Kinim'' (lice) – The [[Egyptians]] were afflicted by [[louse|lice]]
# ''Arov'' (wild animals) – An infestation of wild animals (some say flies) sprang up in Egypt
# ''Dever'' (pestilence) – A plague killed off the Egyptian livestock
# ''Sh'chin'' (boils) – An epidemic of [[boil]]s afflicted the Egyptians
# ''Barad'' (hail) – Hail rained from the sky
# ''Arbeh'' (locusts) – Locusts swarmed over Egypt
# ''Choshech'' (darkness) – Egypt was covered in darkness
# ''Makkat Bechorot'' (killing of the first-born) – All the first-born sons of the Egyptians were slain by God

With the recital of the Ten Plagues, each participant removes a drop of wine from his or her cup using a fingertip. Although this night is one of salvation, [[Don Isaac Abravanel]] explains that one cannot be completely joyous when some of God's creatures had to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Isaac.  ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice''.  New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1992.  Print.  p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] for the plagues is also introduced: &quot;D'tzach Adash B'achav&quot;, while similarly spilling a drop of wine for each word.

At this part in the Seder, songs of praise are sung, including the song ''[[Dayenu]]'', which proclaims that had God performed any single one of the many deeds performed for the Jewish people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. Some sing instead ''The Women's Dayenu'', a feminist variant of ''Dayenu'', by [[Michele Landsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women’s-dayenu/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410111232/http://www.virginitymovie.com/2014/04/the-women%E2%80%99s-dayenu/ |date=2015-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |title=To the pulpit by way of the classroom &amp;#124; NJJN |publisher=Njjewishnews.com |date=2015-03-30 |accessdate=2015-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401235732/http://njjewishnews.com/article/26726/to-the-pulpit-by-way-of-the-classroom#.VR4BXor3bCQ |archive-date=2015-04-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Dayenu'' is a declaration (mandated by Rabban Gamliel) of the reasons of the commandments of the [[Korban Pesach|Paschal lamb]], [[Matzah]], and [[Maror]], with scriptural sources. Then follows a short prayer, and the recital of the first two psalms of [[Hallel]] (which will be concluded after the meal). A long blessing is recited, and the second cup of wine is drunk.

===''Rohtzah'' (ritual washing of hands)===
The ritual hand-washing is repeated, this time with all customs including a blessing.

===''Motzi'' (blessings over the Matzah)===
Two blessings are recited.

First one recites the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words &quot;who brings forth&quot; (motzi in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyHaggadah&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=Nosson|editor1-last=Scherman|editor2-first=Meir|editor2-last=Zlotowitz|title=The Family Haggadah|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd.|orig-year=1981|year=1994|isbn=978-0-89906-178-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/familyhaggadahha0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Matzah''===
Then one recites the blessing regarding the commandment to eat Matzah.

An olive-size piece (some say two) is then eaten while reclining to the left.

===''Maror'' (bitter herbs)===
The blessing for the eating of the maror (bitter herbs) is recited and then it is to be eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyHaggadah&quot;/&gt;

===''Korech'' (sandwich)===
The maror (bitter herb) is placed between two small pieces of matzo, similarly to how the contents of a sandwich are placed between two slices of bread, and eaten. This follows the tradition of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], who did the same at his Seder table 2000 years ago (except that in Hillel's day the Paschal sacrifice, matzo, and maror were eaten together.)

===''Shulchan Orech'' (the meal)===
[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting]]
The festive meal is eaten. Traditionally it begins with the charred egg on the Seder plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard.asp?AID=117122 |title=Chabad.org: 11. Shulchan Orech – set the table |accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Yiddish, there is a saying: {{lang|yi|מיר צוגרייטן די טיש און עסן די פיש}}, which means &quot;We set the table and eat the fish&quot;.

===''Tzafun'' (eating of the ''afikoman'')===
{{Main|Afikoman}}
The ''afikoman'', which was hidden earlier in the Seder, is traditionally the last morsel of food eaten by participants in the Seder.

Each participant receives an olive-sized portion of matzo to be eaten as ''afikoman''. After the consumption of the ''afikoman'', traditionally, no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night. Additionally, no intoxicating beverages may be consumed, with the exception of the remaining two cups of wine.

===''Bareich'' (Grace after Meals)===
The recital of [[Birkat Hamazon]].

==== ''Kos Shlishi'' (the Third Cup of Wine) ====
The drinking of the Third Cup of Wine.

Note: The Third Cup is customarily poured before the [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace after Meals]] is recited because the Third Cup also serves as a [[Birkat Hamazon#Cup of Blessing|Cup of Blessing]] associated with the Grace after Meals on special occasions.

==== ''Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi'' (cup of Elijah the Prophet); Miriam's cup ====
In many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point. [[Psalms]] 79:6–7 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 3:66 among Ashkenazim.

Most Ashkenazim have the custom to fill a fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic discussion that concerns the number of cups that are supposed to be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6–7, some rabbis felt that it was important to include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which – by this stage – was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until [[Elijah]] (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the ''Kos shel Eliyahu'' (&quot;Cup of Elijah&quot;). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the [[Moshiach|Jewish Messiah]].

Some seders (including the original Women's Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam.&lt;ref name=&quot;miriamscup.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.miriamscup.com/RitualFirst.htm Miriam's Cup: Miriam's Cup rituals for the family Passover seder].

Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam's cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston [[Rosh Chodesh]] group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of [[guided meditation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jweekly.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74341/why-miriams-cup-because-without-miriam-jewish-life-would-not-exist/ |title=Why Miriam's Cup?

===''Hallel'' (songs of praise)===
The entire order of Hallel which is usually recited in the synagogue on Jewish holidays is also recited at the Seder table, albeit sitting down. The first two psalms, [[Psalm 113|113]] and [[Psalm 114|114]], were recited before the meal.  The remaining psalms [[Psalm 115|115]]–[[Psalm 118|118]], are recited at this point. [[Psalm 136]] (the Great Hallel) is then recited, followed by ''[[Nishmat]]'', a portion of the morning service for Shabbat and festivals.

There are a number of opinions concerning the paragraph ''Yehalelukha'' which normally follows Hallel, and ''[[Yishtabakh]]'', which normally follows ''Nishmat''. Most Ashkenazim recite ''Yehalelukha'' immediately following the Hallel proper, i.e. at the end of Psalm 118, except for the concluding words. After Nishmat, they recite ''Yishtabakh'' in its entirety.  Sephardim recite '&quot;Yehalelukha'' alone after Nishmat.

Afterwards the Fourth Cup of Wine is drunk and a brief Grace for the &quot;fruit of the vine&quot; is said.

===''Nirtzah''===
{{Main|Passover songs}}
The Seder concludes with a prayer that the night's service be accepted. A hope for the Messiah is expressed: &quot;''[[L'shanah haba'ah]] b'Yerushalayim!'' – [[Next year in Jerusalem]]!&quot; Jews in [[Israel]], and especially those in [[Jerusalem]], recite instead &quot;''L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim hab'nuyah!'' – Next year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!&quot; Jerusalem is the holiest city in the Bible; it has become symbolic of the idea of spiritual perfection.  The tradition of saying &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot; is similar to the tradition of opening the door for Elijah: it recognizes that “this year” we live in an imperfect world outside of “Jerusalem,” but we patiently await a time, hopefully “next year,” in which we live in spiritual perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Kolatch, Alfred J.  ''The Family Seder: A Traditional Passover Haggadah For the Modern Home''.  New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1991.  Print.  p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 15 orders of the Seder have been complete, the Haggadah concludes with additional songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]] will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is ''Chad Gadya'' (&quot;One Kid Goat&quot;). This seemingly childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the [[Vilna Gaon]] as an [[allegory]] to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people at the end of days.

Following the Seder, those who are still awake may recite the [[Song of Songs]], engage in Torah learning, or continue talking about the events of the Exodus until sleep overtakes them.

Furthermore, many Haggadah now use gender-neutral English translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/nyregion/09haggadah.html?_r=0 |title=Giving a Haggadah a Makeover |first=Joseph|last=Berger|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Seders===
The group of people who hold a Passover Seder together is referred to in the [[Talmud]] (tractate Pesachim) as a ''chavurah'' (group). In the [[Far East]], for example, [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] emissaries regularly conduct Seders for hundreds of visiting students, businesspeople and Jewish travelers. The Chabad Seder in [[Kathmandu]] regularly attracts more than 1,200 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadofeugene.org/seder.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217033750/http://www.chabadofeugene.org/seder.htm |archive-date=2009-02-17 |title=chabad of Eugene – Passover Seder |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS and Baltic Countries organized over 500 public Seders throughout the [[Former Soviet Union]], led by local rabbis and Chabad rabbinical students, drawing more than 150,000 attendees in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=130381 |title=FJC: 150,000 celebrate Passover at FJC sponsored Seders in the FSU |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2008-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215044549/http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=130381 |archive-date=2009-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], where permanent residents observe only one Seder, overseas students learning in [[yeshiva]]s and women's seminaries are often invited in groups up to 100 for &quot;second-day Seders&quot; hosted by outreach organizations and private individuals.

===Christian Seders===
{{See also|Passover (Christian holiday)}}
Some [[Christians]], especially but not only [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]], have recently taken great interest in performing seders according to the ancient rubric. Many churches host Seders, usually adding a Messianic Christian Passover message, and many times inviting Messianic Jews to lead and teach on it.  Many [[Christians]] cite the meal as a way to connect with the heritage of their own religion and to see how the practices of the ancient world are still relevant to Christianity today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwrn.org/articles/21173/?&amp;place=united-states&amp;section=judaism |title=WorldWide Religious News-Some Jews see trespass in Christian Seders |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that the current form of the Passover seder dates from the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] period, after Christianity and Judaism had already gone their separate ways. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://schechter.edu/the-origins-of-the-seder/|title=The Origins of the Seder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith Seders===
A number of churches hold interfaith Seders where Jews and non-Jews alike are invited to share in the story and discuss common themes of peace, freedom, and religious tolerance. These themes are only peripherally referenced in a traditional Jewish Seder.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} During the [[American civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, interfaith Seders energized and inspired leaders from various communities who came together to march for equal protection for all. The first of these, the ''Freedom Seder,'' was written by [[Arthur Waskow]], published in ''Ramparts'' magazine and in a small booklet by the Micah Press and in a later edition (1970) by Holt-Rinehart-Winston, and was actually performed on April 4, 1969, the first anniversary of the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.and the third night of Passover, at Lincoln Memorial Temple in Washington, DC. It celebrated the liberation struggle of Black America alongside that of ancient Israel from Pharaoh, and was the first Haggadah to go beyond the original Biblical story. It sparked a large number of Haggadahs celebrating various other forms of liberation – feminism, vegetarianism, the liberation movements in Latin America in the 1970s, ecological healing, etc.. &lt;!--{{See Waskow's book ''Godwrestling -- Round 2.''}}--&gt; Today, many [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregations hold annual interfaith community Seders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe|title=Unitarian Universalists have diverse and inclusive beliefs|date=9 February 2015|website=UUA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Interfaith Passover Seder [[Haggadah]]s have been written especially for this purpose.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Virtual Seders===

When people wish to participate in a shared Seder but are unable to be physically together, technology such as [[Videotelephony|videoconferencing]] software can be used to facilitate a &quot;virtual&quot; Seder.  In 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted in a surge of virtual Seders, as many Jews sought to practice [[social distancing]] during the holiday, or lived in jurisdictions where they were legally required to do so, and thus could not visit the homes of friends and family who were hosting Seders. The website OneTable saw a fourfold increase in the number of virtual seders it hosted from 2019 to 2020, and [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]] was widely used to host virtual Seders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/world/passover-2020-coronavirus-real-plague/index.html|title=This Passover, the seders are virtual.

'''''Nisan''''' (or ''Nissan''; {{lang-he-n|נִיסָן}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Standard]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Nisan'' &lt;small&gt;[[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Nîsān'') in the [[Hebrew calendar]] is the first month of the ecclesiastical year and the seventh month (eighth, in leap year) of the civil year. In the [[Torah]] it is called the month of the ''[[Aviv]]'' (e.g. [[Book of Exodus]], 13:4 {{lang|he|בְּחֹ֖דֶשׁ הָאָבִֽיב}} ''ḥōḏeš hā-’āḇîḇ''). It is a spring month of 30&amp;nbsp;days. Nisan usually falls in March–April on the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the [[Book of Esther]] in the [[Tanakh]] it is referred to as Nisan. [[Karaite Jews]] interpret it as referring to the month in which [[barley]] was ripe.

In 1902, [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] from France and [[Richard Assmann]] from Germany, in separate but coordinated publications and following years of observations, published the discovery of an isothermal layer at around 11–14&amp;nbsp;km, which is the base of the lower stratosphere.

'''James Tiberius Kirk''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' media franchise. Kirk ([[William Shatner]]) first appeared in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' serving aboard the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] as captain. Kirk leads his crew as they explore new worlds, new civilizations, and &quot;[[where no man has gone before|boldly go where no man has gone before]]&quot;. Often, the characters of [[Spock]] and [[Leonard McCoy]] act as his logical and emotional sounding boards, respectively. Captain Kirk has been portrayed in numerous films, books, comics, webisodes, and video games.

Kirk, as played by Shatner, first appears in ''Star Trek'''s first episode, &quot;[[The Man Trap]]&quot;, broadcast on September 8, 1966. Shatner continued in the role for the show's three seasons, and later provided the voice of the animated version of Kirk in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973–1974). Shatner returned to the role for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and in six subsequent films. [[Chris Pine]] portrays an alternative young version of the character in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film. Pine reprised his role in ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and in ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016). Other actors have played the character in fan-created media, and the character has been the subject of multiple [[Parody|spoofs]] and satires.

Kirk became the first and only student at [[Starfleet Academy]] to defeat the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' test, garnering a commendation for original thinking for reprogramming the computer to make the &quot;no-win scenario&quot; winnable.

Spock, who notes that &quot;commanding a starship is [Kirk's] first, best destiny&quot;, dies at the end of ''Star Trek II''. In ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', Admiral Kirk leads his surviving officers in a successful mission to rescue Spock from a planet on which he is reborn.

Picard convinces Kirk to return to Picard's present to help stop the villain Soran from destroying Veridian III's sun. Although Kirk initially refuses the offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him the one thing he has always sought: the ability to make a difference. The two leave the Nexus and stop Soran. However, Kirk is mortally wounded; as he dies, Picard assures him that he helped to &quot;make a difference&quot;. Picard buries Kirk on the planet.

William Shatner tried to imbue the character with qualities of &quot;awe and wonder&quot; absent from &quot;The Cage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;uptillnow120&quot; /&gt; He also drew upon his experiences as a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor to invigorate the character, whose dialogue at times is laden with jargon.&lt;ref name=&quot;startrekmemories&quot; /&gt; Not only did Shatner take inspiration from Roddenberry's suggestion of Hornblower, but also from [[Alexander the Great]]&amp;nbsp;– &quot;the athlete and the intellectual of his time&quot;&amp;nbsp;– whom Shatner had played for an unsold television pilot two years earlier. In addition, the actor based Kirk partly on himself because &quot;the fatigue factor [after weeks of daily filming] is such that you try to be as honest about yourself as possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dillard9&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillard|first=J.M.|author-link=Jeanne Kalogridis|title=Star Trek: &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; — A History in Pictures|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=1994|isbn=0-671-51149-1|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comedy veteran, Shatner suggested making the show's characters as comfortable working in space as they would be at sea, thus having Kirk be a humorous &quot;good-pal-the-captain, who in time of need would snap to and become the warrior&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dillard26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillard|first=J.M.|title=Star Trek: &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; — A History in Pictures|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=1994|isbn=0-671-51149-1|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the character to be &quot;a man with very human emotions&quot; also allowed for the development of the Spock character.&lt;ref name=&quot;uptillnow120&quot; /&gt; Shatner wrote that &quot;Kirk was a man who marveled and greatly appreciated the endless surprises presented to him by the universe ...

Kirk's memorable scream of &quot;Khan!&quot; in the 1982 movie ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' has become a pop culture icon in its own right, spawning internet memes and is widely parodied and paid tribute to.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/09/05/william-shatner-star-trek-wrath-khan-cry-became-instant-legend/596472001/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk has been referenced in the lyrics of many [[pop music|pop songs]]. Early examples include the 1979 song &quot;[[Where's Captain Kirk?]]&quot; by [[Spizzenergi]], the 1982 rap song &quot;[[Tough (Kurtis Blow album)|Tough]]&quot; by [[Kurtis Blow]], and 1983's &quot;[[99 Luftballons]]&quot; by [[Nena (band)|Nena]] (both German and English versions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We Could Have Been the Wombles: The Weird and Wonderful World of One-Hit Wonders|work=Penguin Reference|last=Bromley|first=Tom|publisher=Penguin Books|date=2006|isbn=9780141017112|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best of the Best of Trek II|last1=Irwin|first1=Walter|last2=Love|first2=G.

Captain Kirk has also been portrayed in feline form. First, anthropomorphically, in  two episodes of the 1975 [[Filmation]] Saturday morning animated children’s  series ''[[The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty]]''. The cartoon is based around the title character’s fantasies about being various heroic felines based on popular culture icons.

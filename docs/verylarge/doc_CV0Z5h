Costa Rican chacmools gripped sculpted bowls; these chacmools also served ceremonial purposes although the bowl was used to grind foodstuffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solano260212&quot;/&gt;

==In contemporary culture==
The short story &quot;Chac Mool&quot; by Mexican novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] is found in his book ''Los días enmascarados'' ({{transl|es|The masked days}}), published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 1955, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A man named Filiberto buys a chacmool for his art collection,&lt;ref name=&quot;Filer84p477&quot;&gt;Filer 1984, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; and discovers that the stone is slowly becoming flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 1955, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The idol eventually becomes fully human,&lt;ref name=&quot;Filer84p477&quot;/&gt; dominating his life, causing flooding and other disasters. Filiberto dies by drowning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Filer84p477&quot;/&gt; His story is found in a diary describing the terrors brought on by the idol,&lt;ref&gt;Brushwood 1982, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and his plans to escape. According to the author, this short story was inspired by news reports from 1952 when the lending of a representation of the Maya rain deity to a Mexican exhibition in Europe had coincided with wet weather there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Filer84p477&quot;/&gt;

In [[Henry Moore]]'s early examples of monumental reclining figures, the artist relied on the cast of a chacmool sculpture he saw in Paris. Commenting on the major impact chacmool sculpted figures had on his early career, Moore stated that &quot;Its stillness and alertness, a sense of readiness - and the whole presence of it, and the legs coming down like columns&quot; were characteristics that inspired his creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist-moore-henry-artworks.htm|title=Henry Moore Most Important Art {{!}} TheArtStory|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years and formation (1989–93)===
[[Image:Korn Logo Black PNG.png|thumb|left|Korn's original logo]]

Before Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the band [[L.A.P.D. (band)|L.A.P.D.]] – [[James Shaffer]], [[Reginald Arvizu]], and [[David Silveria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lapd-mn0000118924|title=L.A.P.D. – Overview|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013|author=Torreano, Bradley|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110220400/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lapd-mn0000118924|archivedate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arvizu 36&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally consisting of Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria joined when he was 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;arvizu 36&quot;/&gt; When the band moved from [[Bakersfield, California]] to Los Angeles, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Love and Peace Dude'' in 1989 through [[Triple X Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991 which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled ''[[Who's Laughing Now (album)|Who's Laughing Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/whos-laughing-now-mw0000841594|title=Who's Laughing Now – L.A.P.D|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110213843/http://www.allmusic.com/album/whos-laughing-now-mw0000841594|archivedate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up. They were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey until Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria enlisted [[Brian Welch]] and [[Jonathan Davis]] to form the band that went on to become Korn.&lt;ref name=&quot;arvizu 53-71&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|pp=53–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| description=30-second sample of the song &quot;Predictable&quot; which the band would eventually re-record for their debut album. ''Neidermayer's Mind'' featured the first captured, recorded sound of Korn in the form of four tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;small 16&quot;/&gt;}}
When thinking of a band name, someone suggested &quot;corn&quot;, but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a &quot;K&quot; instead of a &quot;C&quot;, and a backwards &quot;R&quot;, so the band's name would appear as &quot;KoЯn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;arvizu 53-71&quot;/&gt; The idea of using a backwards &quot;R&quot; came from the logo of toy retailer [[Toys R Us]], for which many of the band members had previously worked.&lt;ref name=&quot;arvizu 53-71&quot;/&gt; The logo was designed by vocalist [[Jonathan Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;small 16&quot;/&gt; Silveria explained, &quot;the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Small 1998 p. 16&quot;/&gt;

Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath, called Underground Chicken Sound, in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. While they were recording at Underground Chicken Sound, a crowd had been [[loitering]] outside the studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;fieldy 63&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band began playing a prelude to a later song, &quot;[[Clown (Korn song)|Clown]]&quot;, resulting in a larger crowd gathering. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so &quot;different.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a &quot;pain-in-the-ass.&quot; While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by [[Immortal Records]] A&amp;R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as &quot;the new genre of rock.&quot; In 1993, Korn released their first [[demo album]], ''[[Neidermayer's Mind]]''. The album had very limited printing, and was not well received by critics or the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;small 16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Small|1998|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released to [[record company|record companies]] and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[House of Pain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Small 1998 p. 16&quot;&gt;Small 1998 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; With this demo, Korn pioneered the nu metal sound, riffs and rhythm.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIver-10&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McIver|first=Joel|title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9209-6|pages=10; 12|chapter=How did we get to nu-metal from old metal?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unterberger2004&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009181930/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220|title=Top Ten Nu-Metal Bands|journal=Stylus Magazine|date=September 10, 2004|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|archivedate=October 9, 2004|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Anglia, [[Beorna of East Anglia|Beonna]] probably became king in about 758. Beonna's first coinage predates Offa's own, and implies independence from Mercia. Subsequent East Anglian history is quite obscure, but in 779 [[Æthelberht II of East Anglia|Æthelberht II]] became king, and was independent long enough to issue coins of his own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby 164, 166&quot;&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;164,&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 794, according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', &quot;King Offa ordered King Æthelberht's head to be struck off&quot;. Offa minted pennies in East Anglia in the early 790s, so it is likely that Æthelberht rebelled against Offa and was beheaded as a result.&lt;ref name=Yorke_64&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of the event have survived in which Aethelberht is killed through the machinations of Offa's wife Cynethryth, but the earliest manuscripts in which these possibly legendary accounts are found date from the 11th and 12th centuries, and recent historians do not regard them with confidence.&lt;ref name=SKZ_1&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;210; Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;177; see also Zaluckyj &amp; Zaluckyj, &quot;The Age of Mercian Supremacy&quot;, in Zaluckyj et al., ''Mercia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–153, which gives the details of the earliest versions of the legend.&lt;/ref&gt; The legend also claims that Æthelberht was killed at Sutton St. Michael and buried {{Convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} to the south at [[Hereford]], where his cult flourished, becoming at one time second only to Canterbury as a pilgrimage destination.&lt;ref name=JBlair_288&gt;Blair, ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'', p.&amp;nbsp;288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zaluckyj_153&gt;Zaluckyj &amp; Zaluckyj, &quot;The Age of Mercian Supremacy&quot;, in Zaluckyj et al., ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south of Mercia, [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]] came to the throne of [[Wessex]] in 757 and recovered much of the border territory that Æthelbald had conquered from the West Saxons. Offa won an important victory over Cynewulf at the [[Battle of Bensington]] (in [[Oxfordshire]]) in 779, reconquering some of the land along the Thames.&lt;ref name=Stenton_209&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;209.&lt;/ref&gt; No indisputably authentic charters from before this date show Cynewulf in Offa's entourage,&lt;ref name=Kirby_168/&gt; and there is no evidence that Offa ever became Cynewulf's overlord.&lt;ref name=Stenton_209/&gt; In 786, after the murder of Cynewulf, Offa may have intervened to place [[Beorhtric of Wessex|Beorhtric]] on the West Saxon throne. Even if Offa did not assist Beorhtric's claim, it seems likely that Beorhtric to some extent recognised Offa as his overlord shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Stenton_209/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_141&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;141.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa's currency was used across the West Saxon kingdom, and Beorhtric had his own coins minted only after Offa's death.&lt;ref name=BG_281-2&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Early Medieval Coinage'', pp.&amp;nbsp;281–282.&lt;/ref&gt; In 789, [[Beorhtric of Wessex|Beorhtric]] married [[Eadburh]], a daughter of Offa;&lt;ref name=Yorke_141/&gt; the ''Chronicle'' records that the two kings combined to exile Egbert to [[Francia]] for &quot;three years&quot;, adding that &quot;Beorhtric helped Offa because he had his daughter as his queen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swanton_62&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe that the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s &quot;three years&quot; is an error, and should read &quot;thirteen years&quot;, which would mean Egbert's exile lasted from 789 to 802, but this reading is disputed.&lt;ref name=SSF_1&gt;E.g. Fletcher assumes that Egbert spent essentially all Beorhtric's reign in Francia; see Fletcher, ''Who's Who'', p. 114. Similarly, Swanton annotates &quot;3 years&quot; with &quot;in fact thirteen years&amp;nbsp;... this error is common to all MSS.&quot; See note 12 in Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 62–63. On the other hand, Stenton accepts the figure as three: see Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 220. Stenton adds in a footnote that &quot;it is very dangerous to reject a reading which is so well attested&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Eadburh is mentioned by [[Asser]], a 9th-century monk who wrote a biography of [[Alfred the Great]]: Asser says that Eadburh had &quot;power throughout almost the entire kingdom&quot;, and that she &quot;began to behave like a tyrant after the manner of her father&quot;.&lt;ref name=KL_71-2&gt;Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever power she had in Wessex was no doubt connected with her father's overlordship.&lt;ref name=Yorke_147&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;147.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Offa did not gain the advantage in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, it may be that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the south-east. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.&lt;ref&gt;This theory is due to Kirby; see Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offa's marital alliances extended to [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] when his daughter [[Ælfflæd of Mercia|Ælfflæd]] married [[Æthelred I of Northumbria]] at [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]] in 792.&lt;ref name=Kirby_154&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Northumbria was ever under Mercian control during Offa's reign.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt;

==Wales and Offa's Dyke==
{{main|Offa's Dyke}}
Offa was frequently in conflict with the various Welsh kingdoms. There was a battle between the Mercians and the Welsh at [[Hereford]] in 760, and Offa is recorded as campaigning against the Welsh in 778, 784 and 796 in the tenth-century ''[[Annales Cambriae]]''.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;Annales Cambriae, ''sub anno'' 760, 778 and 784.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_214-5&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offa's Dyke.jpg|thumb|left|Looking along Offa's Dyke, near Knill, [[Herefordshire]]]]

The best known relic associated with Offa's time is [[Offa's Dyke]], a great earthen barrier that runs approximately along the border between England and [[Wales]]. It is mentioned by the monk [[Asser]] in his biography of Alfred the Great: &quot;a certain vigorous king called Offa&amp;nbsp;... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=Asser_71&gt;Asser, ''Alfred the Great'', ch.&amp;nbsp;14, p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; The dyke has not been dated by archaeological methods, but most historians find no reason to doubt Asser's attribution.&lt;ref name=BEASE_341&gt;Margaret Worthington, &quot;Offa's Dyke&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;341.&lt;/ref&gt; Early names for the dyke in both Welsh and English also support the attribution to Offa.&lt;ref name=Stenton_213&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;213.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Asser's comment that the dyke ran &quot;from sea to sea&quot;, it is now thought that the original structure only covered about two-thirds of the length of the border: in the north it ends near [[Llanfynydd, Flintshire|Llanfynydd]], less than {{Convert|5|mi|0|spell=in}} from the coast, while in the south it stops at [[Rushock Hill]], near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, less than {{Convert|50|mi|spell=in}} from the [[Bristol Channel]]. The total length of this section is about {{Convert|64|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEASE_341&quot; /&gt; Other earthworks exist along the Welsh border, of which [[Wat's Dyke]] is one of the largest, but it is not possible to date them relative to each other and so it cannot be determined whether Offa's Dyke was a copy of or the inspiration for Wat's Dyke.&lt;ref name=BEASE_468&gt;Margaret Worthington, &quot;Wat's Dyke&quot;, in Lapidge et al., ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;468.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke.&lt;ref name=BEASE_341/&gt; There are settlements to the west of the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons&lt;!--this seems a rather loaded, POV term--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Stenton_214&gt;Stenton cites, for example, the village &quot;Burlingjobb&quot;, in [[Powys]], not far from the south end of the dyke, as having a name unlikely to have risen as late as the 9th century. Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;214.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and [[Danevirke]], in what is now [[Germany]] as well as such sites as [[Stonehenge]] from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great construction of the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.&lt;ref name=TAS_120-1&gt;Patrick Wormald, &quot;Offa's Dyke&quot;, in James Campbell et al., ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church==
Offa ruled as a Christian king, but despite being praised by [[Charlemagne]]'s advisor, [[Alcuin]], for his piety and efforts to &quot;instruct [his people] in the precepts of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EHD 198, 783&quot;&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 198, p.&amp;nbsp;783.&lt;/ref&gt; he came into conflict with [[Jænberht]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Jænberht had been a supporter of [[Ecgberht II of Kent]], which may have led to conflict in the 760s when Offa is known to have intervened in Kent. Offa rescinded grants made to [[Canterbury]] by Egbert, and it is also known that Jænberht claimed the monastery of [[Cookham]], which was in Offa's possession.&lt;ref name=Yorke_116-7&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 786 [[Pope Adrian I]] sent [[papal legate]]s to England to assess the state of the church and provide canons (ecclesiastical decrees) for the guidance of the English kings, nobles and clergy. This was the first papal mission to England since [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] had been sent by Pope [[Gregory the Great]] in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=Stenton_215-6&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; The legates were George, the [[Bishop of Ostia]], and Theophylact, the [[Diocese of Todi|Bishop of Todi]]. They visited Canterbury first, and then were received by Offa at his court. Both Offa and [[Cynewulf]], king of the West Saxons, attended a council where the goals of the mission were discussed. George then went to Northumbria, while Theophylact visited Mercia and &quot;parts of Britain&quot;. A report on the mission, sent by the legates to [[Pope Adrian I|Pope Adrian]], gives details of a council held by George in Northumbria, and the canons issued there, but little detail survives of Theophylact's mission. After the northern council George returned to the south and another council was held, attended by both Offa and Jænberht, at which further canons were issued.&lt;ref name=Kirby_170&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offa dioceses.gif|thumb|right|The dioceses of England during Offa's reign. The boundary between the archdioceses of Lichfield and Canterbury is shown in bold.]]

In 787, Offa succeeded in reducing the power of Canterbury through the establishment of a rival [[diocese of Lichfield|archdiocese at Lichfield]]. The issue must have been discussed with the papal legates in 786, although it is not mentioned in the accounts that have survived. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' reports a &quot;contentious synod&quot; in 787 at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], which approved the creation of the new archbishopric. It has been suggested that this synod was the same gathering as the second council held by the legates, but historians are divided on this issue. [[Higbert|Hygeberht]], already Bishop of [[Lichfield]], became the new [[archdiocese]]'s first and only archbishop, and by the end of 788 he received the [[pallium]], a symbol of his authority, from Rome.&lt;ref name=Stenton_217-8&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;217–218 &amp; 218 notes 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The new archdiocese included the sees of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[Hereford]], [[Leicester]], [[Lindsey (government district)|Lindsey]], [[Dommoc]] and [[Elmham]]; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories. Canterbury retained the sees in the south and southeast.&lt;ref name=Kirby_174&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The few accounts of the creation of the new archbishopric date from after the end of Offa's reign. Two versions of the events appear in the form of an exchange of letters between [[Coenwulf]], who became king of Mercia shortly after Offa's death, and [[Pope Leo III]], in 798. Coenwulf asserts in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jænberht; but Leo responds that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia.&lt;ref name=EHD_204-5&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 204 &amp; 205, pp.&amp;nbsp;791–794.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Coenwulf and Leo had their own reasons for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa. These are therefore partisan comments. However, both the size of Offa's territory and his relationship with Jænberht and [[Kent]] are indeed likely to have been factors in Offa's request for the creation of the new archdiocese.&lt;ref name=Kirby_169-170&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; Coenwulf's version has independent support, with a letter from Alcuin to [[Æthelhard|Archbishop Æthelheard]] giving his opinion that Canterbury's archdiocese had been divided &quot;not, as it seems, by reasonable consideration, but by a certain desire for power&quot;.&lt;ref name=EHD_203&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 203, pp.&amp;nbsp;788–790.&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelheard himself later said that the award of a pallium to [[Lichfield]] depended on &quot;deception and misleading suggestion&quot;.&lt;ref name=EHD_210&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 210, pp.&amp;nbsp;799–800.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible reason for the creation of an archbishopric at Lichfield relates to Offa's son, [[Ecgfrith of Mercia]]. After [[Hygeberht]] became archbishop, he consecrated Ecgfrith as king; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht's elevation.&lt;ref name=Swanton_52-4&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', sub anno 785, pp.&amp;nbsp;52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that [[Jænberht]] refused to perform the ceremony, and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose.&lt;ref name=Kirby_173&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons: it is the first recorded consecration of any English king, and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith's royal status while his father was still alive. Offa would have been aware that [[Charlemagne]]'s sons, [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pippin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], had been consecrated as kings by [[Pope Adrian I|Pope Adrian]],&lt;ref name=Stenton&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; and probably wished to emulate the impressive dignity of the Frankish court.&lt;ref name=Yorke_115&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other precedents did exist: [[Æthelred of Mercia]] is said to have nominated his son [[Coenred of Mercia|Coenred]] as king during his lifetime, and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration.&lt;ref name=Kirby_173/&gt;

Despite the creation of the new archdiocese, [[Jænberht]] retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence.&lt;ref name=Stenton_218&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;218.&lt;/ref&gt; When Jænberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by [[Hygeberht]], now senior in his turn. Subsequently, [[Æthelhard|Æthelheard]] appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued to respect [[Canterbury]]'s authority.&lt;ref name=Kirby_172&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter from [[Pope Adrian I|Pope Adrian]] to [[Charlemagne]] survives which makes reference to Offa, but the date is uncertain; it may be as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, but it is clear it had been a concern to him.&lt;ref name=Stenton_215&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;215.&lt;/ref&gt; The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.&lt;ref name=Kirby_171&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offa was a generous patron of the church, founding several churches and monasteries, often dedicated to [[Saint Peter|St Peter]].&lt;ref name=Yorke_116&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]], which he probably founded in the early 790s.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt; He also promised a yearly gift of 365 [[mancus]]es to Rome; a mancus was a term of account equivalent to thirty silver pennies, derived from [[Abbasid]] gold coins that were circulating in [[Francia]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Stenton_223&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England, p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;/ref&gt; Control of religious houses was one way in which a ruler of the day could provide for his family, and to this end Offa ensured (by acquiring papal privileges) that many of them would remain the property of his wife or children after his death.&lt;ref name=Yorke_116/&gt; This policy of treating religious houses as worldly possessions represents a change from the early 8th century, when many charters showed the foundation and endowment of small minsters, rather than the assignment of those lands to laypeople. In the 770s, an abbess named Æthelburh (who may have been the same person as Offa's daughter of that name) held multiple leases on religious houses in the territory of the [[Hwicce]]; her acquisitions have been described as looking &quot;like a speculator assembling a portfolio&quot;. Æthelburh's possession of these lands foreshadows [[Cynethryth]]'s control of religious lands, and the pattern was continued in the early 9th century by [[Cwenthryth|Cwoenthryth]], the daughter of King [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]].&lt;ref name=JBlair_129&gt;Blair, ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Either Offa or [[Ine of Wessex]] is traditionally supposed to have founded the [[Schola Saxonum]] in Rome, in what is today the Roman [[rione]], or district, of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. The Schola Saxonum took its name from the militias of Saxons who served in Rome, but it eventually developed into a hostelry for English visitors to the city.&lt;ref name=KL_244&gt;Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European connections==
Offa's diplomatic relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign.&lt;ref name=Stenton_215/&gt; In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, [[Alcuin]] congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, [[Cynethryth]] and [[Ecgfrith]].&lt;ref name=Kirby_175&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHD_195&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 195, pp.&amp;nbsp;779–780.&lt;/ref&gt; In about 789, or shortly before, [[Charlemagne]] proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely [[Ælfflæd]]. Offa countered with a request that his son [[Ecgfrith]] should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters make it clear that by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to help make peace. In the end diplomatic relations were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of [[Abbey of Saint Wandrille|St Wandrille]].&lt;ref name=Stenton_220&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHD_20&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 20, p.&amp;nbsp;313.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne sought support from the English church at the [[council of Frankfurt]] in 794, where the canons passed in 787 at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] were repudiated, and the heresies of two Spanish bishops, [[Felix (Bishop of Urgell)|Felix]] and [[Elipando|Elipandus]], were condemned.&lt;ref name=Stenton_219&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 796 Charlemagne wrote to Offa; the letter survives and refers to a previous letter of Offa's to Charlemagne. This correspondence between the two kings produced the first surviving documents in English diplomatic history.&lt;ref name=Stenton_215/&gt; The letter is primarily concerned with the status of English pilgrims on the continent and with diplomatic gifts, but it reveals much about the relations between the English and the [[Franks]].&lt;ref name=Stenton_220/&gt; Charlemagne refers to Offa as his &quot;brother&quot;, and mentions trade in black stones, sent from the continent to England, and cloaks (or possibly cloths), traded from England to the Franks.&lt;ref name=&quot;EHD 198, 782–784&quot;&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 198, pp.&amp;nbsp;782–784.&lt;/ref&gt; Charlemagne's letter also refers to exiles from England, naming Odberht, who was almost certainly the same person as [[Eadberht III Præn|Eadberht Praen]], among them. [[Egbert of Wessex]] was another refugee from Offa who took shelter at the Frankish court. It is clear that Charlemagne's policy included support for elements opposed to Offa; in addition to sheltering Egbert and Eadberht he also sent gifts to [[Æthelred I of Northumbria]].&lt;ref name=Kirby_176-7&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Offa and then [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] were clearly minor figures by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet L. Nelson|Nelson, Janet]], &quot;Carolingian Contacts&quot; in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', especially pp.&amp;nbsp;139–143. For the contrary view, see Wormald, &quot;The Age of Offa and Alcuin&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The nature of [[Mercia]]n kingship is not clear from the limited surviving sources. There are two main theories regarding the ancestry of Mercian kings of this period. One is that descendants of different lines of the royal family competed for the throne. In the mid-7th century, for example, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] had placed royal kinsmen in control of conquered provinces.&lt;ref name=Yorke_119&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be that a number of kin-groups with local power-bases may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the [[Hwicce]], the [[Tomsæte]] and the unidentified [[Gaini]] are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates, those called in charters &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;princeps&quot; (that is, leaders), may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen.&lt;ref&gt;For all this, see Keynes, &quot;Mercia and Wessex in the Ninth Century&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;314–323, in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia''; see also Williams, &quot;Military Institutions and Royal Power&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;304–305.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa seems to have attempted to increase the stability of Mercian kingship, both by the elimination of dynastic rivals to his son Ecgfrith, and the reduction in status of his subject kings, sometimes to the rank of ealdorman.&lt;ref name=Yorke_TAS_43-4&gt;Yorke, ''Anglo-Saxons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately unsuccessful, however; [[Ecgfrith]] only survived in power for a few months, and 9th century [[Mercia]] continued to draw its kings from multiple dynastic lines.&lt;ref name=BF_314&gt;Simon Keynes, &quot;Mercia and Wessex in the Ninth Century&quot;, in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;314.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Offa constructed a series of defensive ''[[burh]]s'', or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include [[Bedford]], [[Hereford]], [[Northampton]], [[Oxford]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]. In addition to their defensive uses, these ''burhs'' are thought to have been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The ''burhs'' are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by [[Alfred the Great]] a century later to deal with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] invasions.&lt;ref name=Kirby_3&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BF_Market_192&gt;[[Alan Vince]], &quot;Market Centres and Towns in the Mercian Hegemony&quot;, in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the ''burhs'', so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits.&lt;ref name=Yorke_117/&gt; In 749, [[Æthelbald of Mercia]] had issued a charter that freed [[ecclesiastical]] lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges&amp;nbsp;– obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the [[trinoda necessitas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=92 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 92 | accessdate=28 April 2007 |publisher=Sean Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_100&gt;Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may be a sign that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia.&lt;ref name=Yorke_165&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BF_Military_297&gt;Gareth Williams, &quot;Military Institutions&quot;, in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;297.&lt;/ref&gt; These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of &quot;the pagan seaman&quot;.&lt;ref name=BEASE_456&gt;Richard Abels, &quot;''Trinoda Necessitas''&quot;, in Lapidge et al., &quot;Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=134 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 134 | accessdate=18 January 2008 |publisher=Sean Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offa issued laws in his name, but no details of them have survived. They are known only from a mention by [[Alfred the Great]], in the preface to Alfred's own law code. Alfred says that he has included in his code those laws of Offa, [[Ine of Wessex]] and [[Æthelberht of Kent]] which he found &quot;most just&quot;.&lt;ref name=KL_164&gt;Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws may have been an independent lawcode, but it is also possible that Alfred is referring to the report of the legatine mission in 786, which issued statutes that the Mercians undertook to obey.&lt;ref name=KL_305&gt;Keynes &amp; Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage==
[[File:Offa moneyer Edelmod 7 8th century.jpg|thumb|Reverse of a coin of Offa, bearing the name of the moneyer Ethelnoth. [[British Museum]], London.]]
At the start of the 8th century, [[sceatta]]s were the primary circulating [[coin]]age. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the [[moneyer]] or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of [[Ine of Wessex]].&lt;ref name=Stenton_222&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IWL&gt;A transcription of Ine's laws can be read at {{cite web| url = http://www8.georgetown.edu/departments/medieval/labyrinth/library/oe/texts/prose/laws.html#cap44| title = Laws of Alfred and Ine| accessdate = 30 December 2007| publisher = Georgetown University| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217131452/http://www8.georgetown.edu/departments/medieval/labyrinth/library/oe/texts/prose/laws.html#cap44| archivedate = 17 December 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BG_157&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt; This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s.&lt;ref name=BG_278&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;278.&lt;/ref&gt; These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced,&lt;ref name=Stenton_222/&gt; and were prompted by the contemporary [[Carolingian]] currency reforms.&lt;ref name=Kirby_175/&gt; The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa's name and the name of the moneyer from whose mint the coins came.&lt;ref name=Stenton_222/&gt; The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of [[East Anglia]], Kent and [[Wessex]] all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.&lt;ref name=BG_277&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some coins from Offa's reign bear the names of the archbishops of Canterbury, Jænberht and, after 792, Æthelheard. Jænberht's coins all belong to the light coinage, rather than the later medium coinage. There is also evidence that coins were issued by [[Eadbrightus|Eadberht]], who was [[Bishop of London]] in the 780s and possibly before. Offa's dispute with Jænberht may have led him to allow Eadberht coining rights, which may then have been revoked when the see of [[Lichfield]] was elevated to an archbishopric.&lt;ref name=BG_279&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;279.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offa and Cynethryth pennies.gif|thumb|left|300px|Two silver pennies of Offa's reign. The right-hand penny portrays Cynethryth.]]

The medium-weight coins often carry designs of high artistic quality, exceeding that of the contemporary Frankish currency.&lt;ref name=BG_278/&gt; Coin portraits of Offa have been described as &quot;showing a delicacy of execution which is unique in the whole history of the Anglo-Saxon coinage&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stenton_223/&gt; The depictions of Offa on the coins include a &quot;striking and elegant&quot; portrait showing him with his hair in voluminous curls, and another where he wears a fringe and tight curls. Some coins show him wearing a necklace with a pendant. The variety of these depictions implies that Offa's die-cutters were able to draw on varied artistic sources for their inspiration.&lt;ref name=Gannon_31-2&gt;Gannon, ''Iconography of Early Anglo-Saxon Coinage'', pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offa's wife [[Cynethryth]] was the only Anglo-Saxon queen ever named or portrayed on coinage, in a remarkable series of pennies struck by the moneyer Eoba. These were probably derived from contemporary coins from the reign of the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Constantine VI]], who minted a series showing a portrait of his mother, the later Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]],&lt;ref name=BG_279-80&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', pp.&amp;nbsp;279–280.&lt;/ref&gt; though the Byzantine coins show a frontal bust of Irene rather than a profile, and so cannot have been a direct model.&lt;ref name=BF_Women_39&gt;Pauline Stafford, &quot;Political Women in Mercia&quot; in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Jænberht]]'s death and replacement with [[Æthelhard|Æthelheard]] in 792-93, the silver currency was reformed a second time: in this &quot;heavy coinage&quot; the weight of the pennies was increased again, and a standardised non-portrait design was introduced at all mints. None of Jænberht's or Cynethryth's coins occur in this coinage, whereas all of Æthelheard's coins are of the new, heavier weight.&lt;ref name=BG_280&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offa king of Mercia 757 793 gold dinar copy of dinar of the Abassid Caliphate 774.jpg|thumb|A [[mancus]] or gold [[dinar]] of Offa, a copy of the dinars of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (774).]]
There are also surviving gold coins from Offa's reign. One is a copy of an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dinar struck in 774 by Caliph [[Al-Mansur]],&lt;ref name=BF_211&gt;Williams, ''Mercian Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;211,&lt;/ref&gt; with &quot;Offa Rex&quot; centred on the reverse. It is clear that the moneyer had no understanding of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the Arabic text contains many errors. The coin may have been produced to trade with [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 [[mancus]]es that Offa promised to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=manqush+coin#PPA330,M1 |title=Medieval European Coinage By Philip Grierson p.330 |accessdate=17 August 2012|isbn=9780521031776 |last1=Grierson |first1=Philip |last2=Blackburn |first2=Mark A. S. |year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other Western copies of Abbasid [[dinar]]s of the period, but it is not known whether they are English or Frankish. Two other English gold coins of the period survive, from two moneyers, Pendraed and Ciolheard: the former is thought to be from Offa's reign but the latter may belong either to Offa's reign or to that of Coenwulf, who came to the throne in 796. Nothing definite is known about their use, but they may have been struck to be used as alms.&lt;ref name=BG_281&gt;Blackburn &amp; Grierson, ''Medieval European Coinage'', p.&amp;nbsp;281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stenton_223-4&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the coins bear the name of a moneyer, there is no indication of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number and location of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in [[Canterbury]], [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], [[East Anglia]] and London.&lt;ref name=BG_281/&gt;

==Stature==
The title Offa used on most of his charters was &quot;rex Merciorium&quot;, or &quot;king of the Mercians&quot;, though this was occasionally extended to &quot;king of the Mercians and surrounding nations&quot;.&lt;ref name=PASE_title&gt;See the listing under &quot;King&quot;, in the &quot;Office&quot; section under {{cite web | url = {{PASE|305|bare=1}} | title = Offa 7 | website = Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England | accessdate=31 December 2007 |publisher=[[King's College London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his charters use the title &quot;Rex Anglorum,&quot; or &quot;King of the English,&quot; and this has been seen as a sweeping statement of his power. There is debate on this point, however, as several of the charters in which Offa is named &quot;Rex Anglorum&quot; are of doubtful authenticity. They may represent later forgeries of the 10th century, when this title was standard for kings of England.&lt;ref name=Kirby_174/&gt; The best evidence for Offa's use of this title comes from coins, not charters: there are some pennies with &quot;Of ℞ A&quot; inscribed, but it is not regarded as definite that this stood for &quot;Offa Rex Anglorum.&quot;&lt;ref name=BG_279/&gt;

In ''Anglo-Saxon England'', Stenton argued that Offa was perhaps the greatest king of the English kingdoms, commenting that &quot;no other Anglo-Saxon king ever regarded the world at large with so&amp;nbsp;... acute a political sense&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stenton_224&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;224.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians regard Offa's achievements as second only to [[Alfred the Great]] among the Anglo-Saxon kings.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Peter Hunter Blair]] describes him as &quot;perhaps the greatest of all the Anglo-Saxon kings, save only Alfred&quot;; Blair, ''Introduction'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Offa's reign has sometimes been regarded as a key stage in the transition to a unified England, but this is no longer the general view among historians in the field. In the words of [[Simon Keynes]], &quot;Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt; It is now believed that Offa thought of himself as &quot;King of the Mercians,&quot; and that his military successes were part of the transformation of Mercia from an overlordship of midland peoples into a powerful and aggressive kingdom.&lt;ref name=BEASE_340/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke_114&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==
Offa died on 29 July 796,&lt;ref name=Kirby_177&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=day&amp;id=07290796 | title=July 29, 796: Death of King Offa of Mercia | publisher=anglo-saxons.net | work=Anglo-Saxons | accessdate=12 April 2012 | author=Miller, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11215c.htm | title=Offa | publisher=newadvent.org | encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopaedia | year=2009 | accessdate=12 April 2012 | author=Knight, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BROWN_310&gt;Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia: An Anglo-Saxon Kingdom In Europe'', p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; and may be buried in [[Bedford]], though it is not clear that the &quot;Bedeford&quot; named in that charter was actually Bedford.&lt;ref name=EHD_468&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 79, pp.&amp;nbsp;468–470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE_133&gt;Simon Keynes, &quot;Cynethryth&quot;, in Lapidge, ''Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his son, [[Ecgfrith of Mercia]], but according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days.&lt;ref name=Swanton_50&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter written by [[Alcuin]] in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith &quot;has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very well how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son.&quot;&lt;ref name=EHD_786&gt;Whitelock, ''English Historical Documents'', 202, pp.&amp;nbsp;786–788.&lt;/ref&gt; It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and [[Coenwulf]], Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.&lt;ref name=Yorke_118&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

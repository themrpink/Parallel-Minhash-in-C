Despite three separate summons, Nestorius refused to acknowledge Cyril's authority to stand in judgment of him and considered the opening of the council before the arrival of the Antiochene contingent as a &quot;flagrant injustice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt; The 68 bishops who opposed opening the council entered the church in protest, arriving with Count Candidian who declared that the assembly was illegal and must disperse.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; He urged Cyril to wait four more days for the Syrian delegation to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |last=Gibbon |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since even the bishops opposed to opening the council were now present, Cyril maneuvered Candidian by means of a ruse to read out the text of the Emperor's decree of convocation, which the assembly then acclaimed as recognition of its own legality.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 79; When Candidian finished reading the Sacra he surely realised the full extent of his mistake. The Bishops acclaimed long life to the Emperor in demonstrative professions of loyalty, but now with the text officially declaimed in the symbolic presence of the whole Episcopal gathering the Synod of Ephesus was in formal session, legally as well as canonically sanctioned.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of the Antiochene delegation===
When [[John I of Antioch|John of Antioch]] and his Syrian bishops finally reached Ephesus five days after the council, they met with Candidian who informed them that Cyril had begun a council without them and had ratified Celestine's conviction of Nestorius as a heretic. Angered at having undertaken such a long and arduous journey only to have been pre-empted by actions taken by Cyril's council, John and the Syrian bishops held their own Council with Candidian presiding.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The bishops at this council deposed both Cyril and Memnon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt; Initially, the emperor concurred with the actions of John's council but eventually withdrew his concurrence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Second Session - July 10===
The second session was held in Memnon's episcopal residence. Philip, as papal legate, opened the proceedings by commenting that the present question regarding Nestorius had already been decided by Pope Celestine as evidenced by his letter, which had been read to the assembled bishops in the first session. He indicated that he had a second letter from Celestine which was read to the bishops now in attendance. The letter contained a general exhortation to the council, and concluded by saying that the legates had instructions to carry out what the pope had decided on the question and expressed Celestine's confidence that the council would agree. The bishops indicated their approval by acclaiming Celestine and Cyril. Projectus indicated that the papal letter enjoined the council to put into effect the sentence pronounced by Celestine. Firmus, the Exarch of Caesarea in Cappadocia, responded that the pope's sentence had already been carried out in the first session. The session closed with the reading of the pope's letter to the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

===Third Session - July 11===
Having read the Acts of the first session, the papal legates indicated that all that was required was that the council's condemnation of Nestorius be formally read in their presence. When this had been done, the three legates each confirmed the council's actions, signing the Acts of all three sessions. The council sent a letter to Theodosius indicating that the condemnation of Nestorius had been agreed upon not only by the bishops of the East meeting in Ephesus but also of the bishops of the West who had convened at a synod in Rome convened by Celestine. The bishops asked Theodosius to allow them to go home since so many of them suffered from their presence at Ephesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

===Fourth Session - July 16===
At the fourth session, Cyril and Memnon presented a formal protest against John of Antioch for convening a separate conciliabulum. The council issued    a summons for him to appear before them, but he would not even receive the envoys who were sent to serve him the summons.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

===Fifth Session - July 17===
Next day the fifth session was held in the same church. John had set up a placard in the city accusing the synod of the [[Apollinarism|Apollinarian heresy]]. He was again cited, and this was counted as the third canonical summons. He paid no attention. In consequence the council suspended and excommunicated him, together with thirty-four bishops of his party, but refrained from deposing them. Some of John's party had already deserted him, and he had gained only a few. In the letters to the emperor and the pope which were then dispatched, the synod described itself as now consisting of 210 bishops. The long letter to Celestine gave a full account of the council, and mentioned that the pope's decrees against the Pelagians had been read and confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

===Sixth Session - July 22===
At this session, the bishops approved Canon 7 which condemned any departure from the creed established by the [[First Council of Nicaea]], in particular an exposition by the priest Charisius. According to a report from Cyril to Celestine, [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]] tried and failed to create for himself a patriarchate from the territory of the Antiochene patriarchate in which his see lay. He ultimately succeeded in this goal twenty years later at the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE2&quot; /&gt;

===Seventh Session - July 31===
At this session, the council approved the claim of the bishops of Cyprus that their see had been anciently and rightly exempt from the jurisdiction of Antioch. The council also passed five canons condemning [[Nestorius]] and [[Caelestius]] and their followers as heretics and a sixth one decreeing deposition from clerical office or [[excommunication]] for those who did not accept the Council's decrees.

==Canons and declarations==
[[File:Saint Cyril of Alexandria at Chora.jpg|thumb|Cyril of Alexandria]]
Eight canons were passed:
* Canon 1–5 condemned [[Nestorius]] and [[Caelestius]] and their followers as heretics
* Canon 6 decreed deposition from clerical office or [[excommunication]] for those who did not accept the Council's decrees
* Canon 7 condemned any departure from the creed established by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325), in particular an exposition by the priest Charisius.
* Canon 8 condemned interference by the Bishop of Antioch in affairs of the Church in [[Cyprus]] and decreed generally, that no bishop was to &quot;assume control of any province which has not heretofore, from the very beginning, been under his own hand or that of his predecessors […] lest the Canons of the Fathers be transgressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seven_Ecumenical_Councils&quot; /&gt;

The Council denounced Nestorius' teaching as erroneous and decreed that Jesus was one person (hypostasis), and not two separate persons, yet possessing both a human and divine nature. [[The Virgin Mary]] was to be called [[Theotokos]] a Greek word that means &quot;God-bearer&quot; (the one who gave birth to God).

The Council declared it &quot;unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (ἑτέραν) Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicæa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seven_Ecumenical_Councils&quot; /&gt; It quoted the [[Nicene Creed]] as adopted by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, not as added to and modified by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3810.htm Extracts from the Acts of the Council of Ephesus, The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QhZcr6wVi9EC&amp;pg=PA140 Johannes Roldanus, ''The Church in the Age of Constantine''] (Taylor &amp; Francis 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-415-40903-2}}), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JmFetR5Wqd8C&amp;pg=PA166 John Anthony McGuckin (editor), ''The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Theology''] (Wiley 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4443-9254-8}}), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp1gpa7wGPYC&amp;pg=PA383 Adrian Fortescue, ''The Orthodox Eastern Church''] (Kessinger 2004 reprint {{ISBN|978-1-4179-1060-1}}), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some scholars, such as [[Norman Cohn]] and [[Peter Toon]], have suggested that the Council of Ephesus rejected [[premillennialism]], this is a misconception, and there is no evidence of the Council making any such declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Svigel |first1=Michael J. |title=The Phantom Heresy: Did the Council of Ephesus (431) Condemn Chiliasm? |journal=[[Trinity Journal (journal)|Trinity Journal]] |date=2003 |volume=24 |url=https://bible.org/article/phantom-heresy-did-council-ephesus-431-condemn-chiliasm |accessdate=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gumerlock |first1=Francis X. |title=Millennialism and the Early Church Councils: Was Chiliasm Condemned at Constantinople? |journal=[[Fides et Historia]] |date=2004 |volume=36 |pages=83–95 |url=http://francisgumerlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/Millennialism%20and%20the%20Early%20Church%20Councils.%20Gumerlock.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confirmation of the Council's acts==
The bishops at Cyril's council outnumbered those at John of Antioch's council by nearly four to one. In addition, they had the agreement of the papal legates and the support of the population of Ephesus who supported their bishop, Memnon.

However, Count Candidian and his troops supported Nestorius as did Count Irenaeus. The emperor had always been a firm supporter of Nestorius, but had been somewhat shaken by the reports of the council. Cyril's group was unable to communicate with the emperor because of interference from supporters of Nestorius both at Constantinople and at Ephesus. Ultimately, a messenger disguised as a beggar was able to carry a letter to Constantinople by hiding it in a hollow cane.

Although Emperor Theodosius had long been a staunch supporter of Nestorius, his loyalty seems to have been shaken by the reports from Cyril's council and caused him to arrive at the extraordinary decision to ratify the depositions decreed by both councils. Thus, he declared that Cyril, Memnon, and John were all deposed. Memnon and Cyril were kept in close confinement. But in spite of all the efforts of the Antiochene party, the representatives of the envoys whom the council was eventually allowed to send, with the legate Philip, to the Court, persuaded the emperor to accept Cyril's council as the true one. Seeing the writing on the wall and anticipating his fate, Nestorius requested permission to retire to his former monastery. The synod was dissolved in the beginning of October, and Cyril arrived amid much joy at Alexandria on 30 October. Pope Celestine had died on July 27 but his successor, [[Sixtus III]], gave papal confirmation to the council's actions.

==Aftermath==
{{further information|Church of the East}}
[[File:Christological spectrum-o2p.svg|thumb|Christological spectrum during the 5th–7th centuries showing the views of The Church of the East (light blue), Miaphysite (light red) and the western churches i.e. Eastern Orthodox and Catholic (light purple)]]
The events created a major [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between the followers of the different versions of the council, which was only mended by difficult negotiations. The factions that supported John of Antioch acquiesced in the condemnation of Nestorius and, after additional clarifications, accepted the decisions of Cyril's council. However, the rift would open again during the debates leading up to the [[Council of Chalcedon]].

Persia had long been home to a Christian community that had been persecuted by the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] majority, which had accused it of Roman leanings. In 424, the Persian Church declared itself independent of the Byzantine and all other churches, in order to ward off allegations of foreign allegiance. Following the Nestorian Schism, the Persian Church increasingly aligned itself with the Nestorians, a measure encouraged by the Zoroastrian ruling class. The Persian Church became increasingly Nestorian in doctrine over the next decades, furthering the divide between Christianity in Persia and in the Roman Empire. In 486 the Metropolitan of [[Nisibis]], [[Barsauma]], publicly accepted Nestorius' mentor, [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], as a spiritual authority. In 489 when the [[School of Edessa]] in Mesopotamia was closed by Byzantine Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] for its Nestorian teachings, the school relocated to its original home of Nisibis, becoming again the [[School of Nisibis]], leading to a wave of Nestorian immigration into Persia. The Persian patriarch [[Mar Babai I]] (497–502) reiterated and expanded upon the church's esteem for Theodore, solidifying the church's adoption of Nestorianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409819/Nestorians &quot;Nestorian&quot;]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conciliation===
In 1994, the [[Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East]] marked the resolution of a dispute between those two churches that had existed since the Council of Ephesus. They expressed their common understanding of doctrine concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ, and recognized the legitimacy and rightness of their respective descriptions of Mary as, on the Assyrian side, &quot;the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour&quot;, and, on the Catholic side, as &quot;the Mother of God&quot; and also as &quot;the Mother of Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_11111994_assyrian-church_en.html Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104205725/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_11111994_assyrian-church_en.html |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Æthelred I''' (or '''Aethelred''' or '''Ethelred'''; [[Old English]] ''Æthel-ræd'', meaning noble counsel;{{sfn|Keynes|2004}} 845/848 to 871) was King of [[Wessex]] from 865 until his death. He was the fourth of five sons of King [[Æthelwulf of Wessex]], four of whom in turn became king. He succeeded his elder brother [[Æthelberht, King of Wessex|Æthelberht]] and was followed by his youngest brother, [[Alfred the Great]]. Æthelred had two sons, [[Æthelhelm]] and [[Æthelwold ætheling|Æthelwold]], who were passed over for the kingship on their father's death because they were still infants. Alfred was succeeded by his son, [[Edward the Elder]], and Æthelwold unsuccessfully disputed the throne with him.

Æthelred's accession coincided with the arrival of the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] in England. Over the next five years the [[Vikings]] conquered [[Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and at the end of 870 they launched a full-scale attack on Wessex. In early January 871 Æthelred was defeated at the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]]. Four days later he scored a victory in the [[Battle of Ashdown]], but this was followed by two defeats at [[Battle of Basing|Basing]] and [[Battle of Meretun|Meretun]]. He died shortly after Easter. Alfred was forced to buy off the Vikings, but he scored a decisive victory over them seven years later at the [[Battle of Edington]].

Æthelred's reign was important numismatically. Wessex and [[Mercia]] were close allies when he became king, and he carried the alliance further by adopting the Mercian Lunettes design, thus creating a unified coinage design for southern England for the first time. The common design foreshadowed the unification of England over the next sixty years and the [[History of the English penny (c. 600 – 1066)#Edgar's reform, c. 973 and the late Anglo-Saxon coinage|reform coinage]]{{efn|name=reform}} of King [[Edgar I]] a century later.

==Background==
[[File:Southern British Isles 9th century.svg|upright=2.25|thumb|Southern Britain in the ninth century|alt=Southern Britain in the ninth century]]
Æthelred's grandfather,  [[Ecgberht, King of Wessex|Ecgberht]], became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since [[Ceawlin]] in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of [[Cerdic]], the founder of the West Saxon dynasty.{{efn|Historians have expressed doubt both whether the genealogy for Ecgberht going back to Cerdic was fabricated to legitimise his seizure of the West Saxon throne,{{sfn|Edwards|2004}} and broadly whether Cerdic was a real person or if the story of Cerdic is a &quot;foundation myth&quot;.{{sfn|Yorke|2004}}  }} This made Ecgberht an [[ætheling]] – a prince eligible for the throne. But after Ecgberht's reign, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling. When Ecgberht died in 839 he was succeeded by his son [[Æthelwulf]]; all subsequent West Saxon kings were Ecgberht's descendants, and were also sons of kings.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=2002|1pp=84–85|2a1=Dumville|2y=1979|2pp=17–18|3a1=Yorke|3y=1990|3pp=142–43, 148–49}}

At the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s. The Midland kingdom of [[Mercia]] dominated southern England, but its supremacy came to an end in 825 when it was decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the [[Battle of Ellendun]].{{sfn|Keynes|1995|pp=28, 39–41}} The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to [[Viking]] attacks.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=28–29}}  In 853, King [[Burgred of Mercia]] requested West Saxon help to suppress a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] rebellion, and Æthelwulf led a West Saxon contingent in a successful joint campaign.

In 825, Ecgberht sent Æthelwulf to invade the Mercian sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], and its sub-king, [[Baldred of Kent|Baldred]], was driven out shortly afterwards. By 830, [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Surrey|Surrey]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] had also submitted to Ecgberht, and he had appointed Æthelwulf to rule the south-eastern territories as King of Kent.{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1993|1pp=120–21|2a1=Kirby|2y=2000|2pp=155–56}} The Vikings ravaged the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in 835, and the following year they defeated Ecgberht at [[Carhampton, Somerset|Carhampton]] in [[Somerset]],{{sfnm|1a1=Edwards|1y=2004|2a1=Kirby|2y=2000|2p=171}} but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of [[Cornishmen]] and Vikings at the [[Battle of Hingston Down]], reducing Cornwall to the status of a [[client kingdom]].{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2013|p=431}} When Æthelwulf succeeded, he appointed his eldest son [[Æthelstan of Kent|Æthelstan]] (who died in the early 850s) as sub-king of Kent.{{sfn|Nelson|2004}}  Ecgberht and Æthelwulf may not have intended a permanent union between Wessex and Kent as they both appointed sons as sub-kings and charters in Wessex were attested (witnessed) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish charters were witnessed by the Kentish elite; both kings kept overall control and the sub-kings were not allowed to issue their own coinage.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p= 31}}

Æthelred was the fourth of five sons of King Æthelwulf. His mother, [[Osburh]], was of West Saxon royal descent. According to the historian Sean Miller, Æthelred was probably a year or so older than his younger brother, the future [[Alfred the Great]], who was born 848–9,{{sfn|Miller|2004}} but Richard Abels says that Æthelred was around eight years old in 853, which would mean he was born about 845.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p= 67 n. 57}}  Manuscript A of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which was written in the 890s, states that in 853 Alfred was sent by his father to Rome and was consecrated by the Pope as king. Historians do not believe that he was consecrated king at this young age and the real nature of the ceremony is explained in an extract from a letter of [[Pope Leo IV]] to Æthelwulf, which records that he decorated Alfred &quot;as a spiritual son, with the dignity of the belt and the vestments of the consulate, as is customary with Roman consuls&quot;. The contemporary ''[[Liber Vitae]]'' (confraternity book) of [[San Salvatore, Brescia|San Salvatore]], [[Brescia]], records the names of both Æthelred and Alfred, indicating that both brothers went to Rome. It is likely that Æthelred was also decorated by the pope, but the ceremony was later regarded as foreshadowing Alfred's greatness and neither the chronicler nor the eleventh-century extractor from the Pope's letters were interested in recording the presence of his lesser known elder brother.{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=2004|2a1=Keynes and Lapidge|2y=1983|2pp=69, 232|3a1=Swanton|3y=2000|3pp=xxi, 64|4a1=Whitelock|4y=1955|4p= 810 (no. 219)}}

Æthelred first witnessed his father's charters as ''filius regis'' (king's son) in 854, and he witnessed with this title until he succeeded to the throne in 865. He may have acted as an underking before his accession, as in 862 and 863 he issued his own charters as King of the West Saxons. This must have been as deputy or in the absence of his elder brother, King Æthelberht, as there is no record of conflict between them and he continued to witness his brother's charters as a king's son in 864.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Abels|2y=1998|2p= 50}}{{efn|The first charter which Æthelred witnessed was S 308 in 854.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=50}} He issued charters S 335 in 862 and S 336 in 863 as King of the West Saxons.

Æthelred succeeded to the throne on Æthelberht's death in 865, and he married [[Wulfthryth of Wessex|Wulfthryth]] at an unknown date. West Saxon kings' wives had a low status in the ninth century and very little is known about them. They were not usually given the title of ''regina'' (queen), an omission which Alfred the Great justified on the ground of the misconduct of a queen at the beginning of the ninth century. The name of Æthelred's wife is only known because she was recorded as a witness to one charter, S 340 of 868, where she is shown as ''Wulfthryth regina'', suggesting that she had a higher status than other kings' wives. The only other ninth century king's wife known to have been given the title was [[Æthelwulf of Wessex|Æthelwulf]]'s second wife, [[Judith of Flanders]], a great granddaughter of [[Charlemagne]]. Wulfthryth and Æthelred had two known sons, [[Æthelhelm]] and [[Æthelwold ætheling|Æthelwold]].{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes and Lapidge|1y=1983|1pp=71, 235–36, n. 28|2a1=Yorke|2y=2001|2p=31}}{{efn|Æthelred may have had a third son, Oswald or Osweald, who witnessed two charters in 868 as ''filius regis'', and one more during Alfred's reign in 875 with the same title. [[David Dumville]] suggests that he may have been a son of Æthelred;{{sfn|Dumville|1979| p= 11}} however, this is dismissed by [[Janet Nelson]] on the ground that only Æthelhelm and Æthelwold are mentioned in the prologue to Alfred's will, where he describes disputes shortly after his succession in 871 over his treatment of Æthelred's sons.{{sfn|Nelson|1996| p= 59}} }} She may have been Mercian{{sfn|Hollis|1992|p=215, n. 40}} or a daughter of [[Wulfhere, Ealdorman of Wiltshire]], who forfeited his lands after being charged with deserting King Alfred for the Danes in about 878, perhaps because he attempted to secure Viking support for his elder grandson Æthelhelm's claim to the throne against Alfred.{{sfn|Nelson|1986|pp=53–55}}

Alfred records in the preamble to his will that Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, with the proviso that the brother who lived longest would succeed to all of it. When Æthelbald died in 860, Æthelred and Alfred, who were still young, agreed to entrust their share to the new king, Æthelberht, on a promise that he would return it to them intact. When Æthelred succeeded to the throne, Alfred asked him at a meeting of the [[witan]] (assembly of leading men) to give him his share of the property. However, Æthelred said that he had attempted many times to divide it but had found it too difficult, and he would instead leave the whole to Alfred on his death. Some historians see the bequest as including the whole of Æthelwulf's [[Bookland (law)|bookland]], his personal property which he could leave in his will (as opposed to the folkland which passed according to customary law and property earmarked for the support of the crown); it is further argued that it was considered desirable that the bookland would be kept by the king, so Æthelwulf's provision implies that the throne would pass to each brother in turn.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=2002|1pp=90–91|2a1=Keynes and Lapidge|2y=1983|2pp=174–75, 314–15, n. 3|3a1=Wormald|3y=2001|3pp=268–70}} However, other historians assert that the bequest had nothing to do with the kingship,{{sfn|Nelson|2004}} and [[Alfred P. Smyth|Alfred Smyth]] argues that the bequest was provision for Æthelwulf's young sons when they reached adulthood, with Æthelbald as trustee and residuary beneficiary if they died young.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|pp=416–18}} When Alfred succeeded, the supporters of Æthelred's infant sons complained that Alfred should have shared the property with them, and Alfred had his father's will read to a meeting of the witan to prove his right to keep the whole of the property.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|pp=174–75}} Alfred rarely witnessed Æthelred's charters, and this together with the argument over their father's will suggests that they may not have been on good terms. The historian [[Pauline Stafford]] suggests that Æthelred may have chosen to highlight his wife's status as queen in a charter in order to assert his own sons' claims to the succession.{{sfn|Stafford|2003|p=260}}

In 868, Æthelred issued a charter which was attested by a Mercian ætheling and himself attested a charter issued by his sister, Æthelswith, as queen of Mercia.{{sfn|Abels|1998|p=121}}  Æthelred used several different titles in his charters. He is called by his father's usual title, ''Rex Occidentalium Saxonum'' (King of the West Saxons) in the charter of Ealhswith which he witnessed, and in five of his own. He is  &quot;King of the West Saxons and the Men of Kent&quot; in two, and &quot;King&quot; and &quot;King of the Saxons&quot; in one each.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|p=386}}{{efn|[[Alfred P.

===The Viking invasions===
The character of Viking attacks on England decisively changed in the year that Æthelred succeeded to the throne. Previously the country had suffered from sporadic raids, but now it faced invasion aiming at conquest and settlement. A large force of Vikings, called by contemporaries the [[Great Heathen Army]], arrived in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. King [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund]] purchased peace by paying tribute and the Vikings stayed a year building up their strength. They then marched on [[York]] and conquered [[Northumbria]], installing a puppet king. In late 867 they took [[Nottingham]] in Mercia and spent the winter there. Æthelred's brother-in-law, King Burgred, appealed to him for help. Æthelred and Alfred led a large West Saxon army to Nottingham and besieged the Vikings, but they refused to leave the safety of the town's defences. The combined Mercian and West Saxon armies were unable to breach the earth ramparts and ditch, and eventually Burgred bought them off. The Vikings then went back to York.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=114–20}}{{efn|In 874 the Vikings took control of Mercia and drove Burgred and Æthelswith into exile.{{sfn|Kelly|2004}} }}

In 869 the Vikings returned to East Anglia and conquered the kingdom, killing King Edmund. In December 870 they launched an attempt to conquer Wessex led by Kings [[Bagsecg]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]]. They occupied [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] on around 28 December. The town is between the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Kennet|Kennet]] rivers, and they set about building a ditch and rampart on the southern side between the two rivers. Three days after their arrival they sent out a large foraging party, which was defeated by an army of local levies under the command of [[Æthelwulf of Berkshire|Æthelwulf]], Ealdorman of [[Berkshire]], at the [[Battle of Englefield]]. After another four days, on about 4 January 871, Æthelred and Alfred brought up the main West Saxon army and joined Æthelwulf's forces for an attack on the Danes in the [[Battle of Reading (871)|Battle of Reading]]. The West Saxons fought their way to the town, slaughtering all the Danes they found outside, but when they reached the town gate the Vikings burst out and defeated the West Saxons with a successful counter-attack. Among the dead was Æthelwulf, whose body was secretly carried off to be buried in his native [[Derby]].{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=124–27|2a1=Beaven|2y=1918|2p=334}} According to the twelfth-century chronicler [[Geoffrey Gaimar|Gaimar]], Æthelred and Alfred only escaped due their better knowledge of the local terrain, which allowed them to lose their pursuers by fording the [[River Loddon]] at [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]] and going on to [[Whistley Green]], which is around {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} east of Reading.{{sfn|Smyth|1995|p=34}}

Four days later, on about 8 January, the armies met again in the [[Battle of Ashdown]]. The location of the battle is unknown, but may be [[Moulsford|Kingstanding Hill]], {{convert|13|mi|km|abbr=off}} north-west of Reading. According to Asser's account, the Vikings arrived first at the battle ground and deployed along the top of the ridge, giving them the advantage. They divided their forces into two contingents, one under their two kings and the other under their earls. When the West Saxons saw this, they decided to copy the formation, with Æthelred facing the kings and Alfred the earls. The king then retired to his tent to hear [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], while Alfred led his forces to the battlefield. Both sides formed their forces into [[shield wall]]s. Æthelred would not cut short his devotions{{efn|According to Asser: &quot;Alfred and his men reached the battlefield sooner and in better order: for his brother, King Æthelred, was still at his tent in prayer, hearing Mass and declaring firmly that he would not leave that place alive before the priest had finished Mass, and that he would not forsake divine service for that of men; and he did what he said. The faith of the Christian king counted for much with the Lord, as shall be shown more clearly in what follows.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|p=79}} }} and Alfred risked being outflanked and overwhelmed by the whole Danish army. He decided to attack and led his men in a charge. Battle then raged around a small thorn tree and finally the West Saxons were victorious. Although Asser emphasises Alfred's role in the victory and implies that Æthelred was dilatory, in the view of the military historian John Peddie, Æthelred was militarily correct to delay joining the battle until the situation was in his favour.  The Vikings suffered heavy losses, including King Bagsecg and five earls, Sidroc the Old, Sidroc the Younger, Osbern, Fræna and Harold. The West Saxons followed the Viking flight until nightfall, cutting them down.{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=129–31|2a1=Peddie|2y=1989|2pp=82–88|3a1=Beaven|3y=1918|3p=334}} The historian [[Barbara Yorke]], who sees Asser's biography as intended to portray Alfred as an ideal king, comments that &quot;Asser is particularly careful to give much credit to Alfred&quot;.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|pp=105–06, 109}}

However, the victory was short-lived. Two weeks later, Æthelred and Alfred were defeated at the royal estate of [[Old Basing|Basing]] in the [[Battle of Basing]]. There was then a lull of two months until the West Saxons and the Vikings met at an unknown location called Meretun. In the [[Battle of Meretun|battle]] on 22 March the Vikings again divided into two divisions and the West Saxons had the advantage for much of the day, putting both divisions to flight, but the Vikings regrouped and finally held control of the battlefield. The West Saxons lost many important men, including [[Heahmund]], the [[Bishop of Sherborne]].{{sfnm|1a1=Abels|1y=1998|1pp=131–34|2a1=Beaven|2y=1918|2p=334}}{{efn|The death of Bishop Heahmund in the battle dates the sequence of events, as it is known that he died on 22 March 871. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' records that the Battle of Basing was two months before Meretun, dating it to 22 January, Ashdown fourteen days before that on 8 January, Reading four days earlier on 4 January, Englefield another four days earlier on 31 December 870 and the arrival of the Vikings in Reading three days earlier on 28 December. However, as the two month interval between Marton and Basing is probably not exact, the earlier dates are approximate.{{sfn|Beaven|1918|p=334}} }}

In the late eighth and ninth centuries the only denomination of coin produced in southern England was the silver penny.{{sfn|Naismith|2012|p=203}} As of 2007, 152 coins of Æthelred struck by 32 different moneyers have been recorded.{{efn|There are also ten coins of [[Ceolnoth]], who was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] until his death in 870.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|p=77}} }} His reign is described by the numismatists Adrian Lyons and William Mackay as &quot;a critical point in the development of the English coinage&quot;. His first Four Line issue was stylistically similar to the Floriate Cross penny of his predecessor, Æthelberht, but he soon abandoned this and adopted the design of his Mercian brother-in-law, Burgred, resulting in a common coinage design across southern England for the first time.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=71–72, 77, 98–99}} The historian and numismatist Rory Naismith comments that Æthelred
:took the important step of adopting a new coin-type based not on local tradition, but on the Lunettes-type current in contemporary Mercia. The year 865 thus saw not only the arrival of the Viking great army that would dismantle most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, but also the beginning of the end for separate coinages in separate kingdoms.{{sfn|Naismith|2012|p=11}}
Lyons and Mackay see the change as even more crucial:
:The developments of the late 860s can thus be viewed as an essential precursor that eventually led to the unified [[History of the English penny (c. 600 – 1066)#Edgar's reform, c. 973 and the late Anglo-Saxon coinage|reform coinage]] of [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]].{{efn|name=reform|Edgar's radical coinage reform of the 970s heralded a monetary system which was the most sophisticated in Europe. It lasted 150 years.{{sfn|Blackburn|2014|p=116}} }} This convergence of the coinage is also tangible evidence for a growing collaboration between Mercia and Wessex which foreshadowed the eventual creation of a unified England.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=71–72}}

The single coinage design created a form of monetary union in southern England, reinforcing the mingling of economic interests between the two kingdoms and the military alliance against the Vikings. Coin hoards in Wessex dating to the earlier period of separate coinage designs have few non-Wessex coins, but after the adoption of the common Lunettes design, coins of Wessex and Mercia were used in both kingdoms, and even in Wessex hoards coins of Æthelred I form a minor proportion of the total. Between one and one and a half million Æthelred I Regular Lunette coins were produced, but this seems to have been significantly less than in Mercia. It is not known why the Mercian design was adopted, but it probably reflects the fact that the Lunette type had already been used for more than twelve years, the simplicity of the design, which could easily be copied, and the greater strength of the Mercian economy.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=73–79}} The bulk of surviving Æthelred I coins are of the Regular Lunettes design, with 118 coins struck by 21 moneyers, six of whom are known to have also worked for Burgred; the coins are notable for consistency in design and good quality of execution, and they were mainly produced by [[Canterbury]] moneyers, with a few in the Mercian town of London.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=85–87}} Only one coin is known which was produced in Wessex itself.{{sfn|Naismith|2012|p=110}} There were also Irregular Lunettes issues, one of which was a degraded and crude variant, perhaps a result of a breakdown in controls at the end of Æthelred's reign, when Wessex was under the pressure of Viking attacks.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=93, 100}} Alfred kept the Lunettes design for a short period following his accession in 871, but the design disappears from hoards deposited after around 875.{{sfn|Lyons and Mackay|2007|pp=74, 94}}

==Death and aftermath==
Shortly after Easter 871, which fell on 15 April in that year, Æthelred died. According to Asser, he &quot;went the way of all flesh, having vigorously and honourably ruled the kingdom in good repute, amid many difficulties, for five years&quot;.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|p=80}} He was buried at the royal [[Minster (church)|minster]] at [[Wimborne Minster (church)|Wimborne]] in [[Dorset]], which had been founded by Saint [[Cuthburh]], a sister of his ancestor, [[Ingild]].{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=1995|1p=187|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2p=250}} While Alfred was attending his funeral, the West Saxons suffered another defeat at Reading, and Alfred himself was then defeated at [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]]. He was forced to buy off the Vikings, who then withdrew to London.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=134–40}} In 876, the Vikings returned, and Alfred fought a guerrilla war until he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878.{{sfn|Wormald|2006}}

Æthelred had two sons, and if he had lived until they were adults it is unlikely that Alfred would ever have become king, but as they were still young children Alfred succeeded.{{sfn|Kirby|2000|p=170}} Æthelhelm died before Alfred, and Æthelwold unsuccessfully disputed the throne with [[Edward the Elder]] after Alfred's death in 899.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1p=31|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} One of the two places where Æthelwold launched his rebellion was Wimborne, which was symbolically important as his father's burial place.{{sfn|Lavelle|2009|pp=61–62}} Æthelred's descendants played an important role in governing the country in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=101}} They include Ealdorman [[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]], who recorded in his Latin version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' that he was Æthelred's great-great-grandson. King [[Eadwig]] was forced to accept annulment of his marriage to [[Ælfgifu, wife of Eadwig|Ælfgifu]] due to consanguinity; she may have been Æthelweard's sister, which would make her Eadwig's third cousin once removed due to her descent from Æthelred, and thus within the forbidden degrees of relationship according to the church.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=1997|1pp=76–77|2a1=Bouchard|2y=1981|2pp=269–70}} Æthelweard and his son [[Æthelmær the Stout|Æthelmær]] were leading magnates who governed west Wessex as ealdormen of the western provinces. The family lost their positions and property after [[Cnut]] conquered England in 1016, and one of Æthelmær's sons was executed by Cnut in 1017, while a son-in-law was banished in 1020.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|pp=100–01, 141–42}} Another son, [[Æthelnoth (archbishop of Canterbury)|Æthelnoth]], was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and he lived until 1038.{{sfn|Mason|2004}}

[[File:Obşteasca Adunare, 1837.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sfatul boieresc|Legislative Assembly]] of Wallachia in 1837]]

On March 21, 1821, Vladimirescu entered Bucharest. For the following weeks, relations between him and his allies worsened, especially after he sought an agreement with the Ottomans;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Eteria's leader [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], who had established himself in Moldavia and, after May, in northern Wallachia, viewed the alliance as broken—he had Vladimirescu executed, and faced the Ottoman intervention without Pandur or Russian backing, suffering major defeats in Bucharest and [[Drăgășani]] (before retreating to [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] custody in [[Transylvania]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 301; Giurescu, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; These violent events, which had seen the majority of Phanariotes siding with Ypsilantis, made [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] place the Principalities under its occupation (evicted by a request of several European powers),&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.307&lt;/ref&gt; and sanction the end of Phanariote rules: in Wallachia, the first prince to be considered a local one after 1715 was [[Grigore IV Ghica]]. Although the new system was confirmed for the rest of Wallachia's existence as a state, Ghica's rule was abruptly ended by the devastating [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] placed Wallachia and Moldavia under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman [[suzerainty]], awarding them the first common institutions and semblance of a [[constitution]] (see [[Regulamentul Organic]]). Wallachia was returned ownership of [[Brăila]], [[Giurgiu]] (both of which soon developed into major trading cities on the [[Danube]]), and [[Turnu Măgurele]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 122, 127&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also allowed Moldavia and Wallachia to freely trade with countries other than the Ottoman Empire, which signalled substantial economic and urban growth, as well as improving the peasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 262, 324; Giurescu, pp. 127, 266&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the provisions had been specified by the 1826 [[Akkerman Convention]] between Russia and the Ottomans, but it had never been fully implemented in the three-year interval.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; The duty of overseeing of the Principalities was left to Russian general [[Pavel Kiselyov]]; this period was marked by a series of major changes, including the reestablishment of a [[Wallachian Army]] (1831), a [[tax reform]] (which nonetheless confirmed [[tax exemption]]s for the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileged]]), as well as major urban works in Bucharest and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 323–324; Giurescu, pp. 122–127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, Wallachia's throne was occupied by [[Alexandru II Ghica]]—a move in contradiction with the Adrianople treaty, as he had not been elected by the new [[Sfatul boieresc|Legislative Assembly]]; he was removed by the suzerains in 1842 and replaced with an elected prince, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

====1840s–1850s====
{{Main|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}
[[Image:Costache Petrescu - Grupul de manifestanti pentru revolutie la 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|right|1848 revolutionaries carrying an early version of the [[flag of Romania]]. The text on the flag can be translated as: &quot;Justice, Brotherhood&quot;.]]

Opposition to Ghica's arbitrary and highly [[Conservatism|conservative]] rule, together with the rise of [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] currents, was first felt with the protests voiced by Ion Câmpineanu (quickly repressed);&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 329; Giurescu, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently, it became increasingly [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiratorial]], and centered on those [[Secret society|secret societies]] created by young officers such as [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and [[Mitică Filipescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 330; Giurescu, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;
''Frăția'', a clandestine movement created in 1843, began planning a revolution to overthrow Bibescu and repeal ''Regulamentul Organic'' in 1848 (inspired by the [[Revolutions of 1848|European rebellions of the same year]]). Their pan-Wallachian ''[[coup d'état]]'' was initially successful only near [[Turnu Măgurele]], where crowds cheered the ''[[Islaz Proclamation]]'' (June 9); among others, the document called for [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]], independence, [[land reform]], and the creation of a national guard.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 331; Giurescu, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11–12, the movement was successful in deposing Bibescu and establishing a Provisional Government. Although sympathetic to the anti-Russian goals of the revolution, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into repressing it: Ottoman troops entered Bucharest on September 13.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 331; Giurescu, pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and Turkish troops, present until 1851, brought [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]] to the throne, during which interval most participants in the revolution were sent into exile.

[[File:Rom1856-1859.png|thumb|left|Wallachia (in green), after the Treaty of Paris (1856)]]

Briefly under renewed Russian occupation during the [[Crimean War]], Wallachia and Moldavia were given a new status with a neutral [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] administration (1854–1856) and the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]]: a tutelage shared by Ottomans and a Congress of Great Powers (Britain, France, the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], the Austrian Empire, Prussia, and, albeit never again fully, Russia), with a ''[[kaymakam]]''-led internal administration. The emerging movement for a union of the [[Danubian Principalities]] (a demand first voiced in 1848, and a cause cemented by the return of revolutionary exiles) was advocated by the French and their Sardinian allies, supported by Russia and Prussia, but was rejected or suspicioned by all other overseers.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Divanul Ad-Hoc, 1857.jpg|thumb|Wallachia's ''[[Ad hoc Divan]]'' in 1857]]

After an intense campaign, a formal union was ultimately granted: nevertheless, elections for the ''[[Ad hoc Divan]]s'' of 1859 profited from a legal ambiguity (the text of the final agreement specified two thrones, but did not prevent any single person from simultaneously taking part in and winning elections in both Bucharest and [[Iași]]). [[Alexander John Cuza]], who ran for the unionist ''[[Partida Națională]]'', won the elections in Moldavia on January 5; Wallachia, which was expected by the unionists to carry the same vote, returned a majority of anti-unionists to its ''divan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p. 142&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Those elected changed their allegiance after a mass protest of Bucharest crowds,&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p. 142&quot;/&gt; and Cuza was voted prince of Wallachia on February 5 (January 24 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), consequently confirmed as ''[[Domnitor]]'' of the [[United Principalities|United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]] (''of Romania'' from 1862). Internationally recognized only for the duration of his reign, the union was irreversible after the ascension of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] in 1866 (coinciding with the [[Austro-Prussian War]], it came at a time when Austria, the main opponent of the decision, was not in a position to intervene).

==Society==

===Slavery===
[[Slavery in Romania|Slavery]] ({{lang-ro|robie}}) was part of the [[social class|social order]] from before the founding of the Principality of Wallachia, until it was [[slavery in Romania|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Achim&gt;Viorel Achim, The Roma in Romanian History, [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first document attesting the presence of Roma people in Wallachia dates back to 1385, and refers to the group as ''ațigani'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]'' [[athinganoi]]'', the origin of the Romanian term ''țigani'', which is synonymous with &quot;Gypsy&quot;).&lt;ref name=Djuvara&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient și Occident. Țările române la începutul epocii moderne'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1995. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}} {{in lang|ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origins of slavery are not known. Slavery was a common [[Slavery in medieval Europe|practice in Eastern Europe]] at the time, and there is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia as free people or as slaves. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]]{{fact|date=June 2019}} until their social organization was destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the [[Mongols]] as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols.&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt; While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the [[Danube]] at the end of the 14th century, some time after the [[foundation of Wallachia]]. The arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice.&lt;ref name=Stefanescu&gt;Ștefan Ștefănescu, ''Istoria medie a României'', Vol. I, Editura Universității din București, Bucharest, 1991 {{in lang|ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the ''hospodars'', and went by the [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] name of ''țigani domnești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the lord&quot;). The two other categories comprised ''țigani mănăstirești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the monasteries&quot;), who were the property of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monasteries, and ''țigani boierești'' (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the boyars&quot;), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.&lt;ref name=Djuvara/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guy&gt;Will Guy, ''Between Past and Future: The Roma of Central and Eastern Europe'', [[University of Hertfordshire|University of Hertfordshire Press]], Hatfield, 2001. {{ISBN|1-902806-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarizing and becoming peasants. During the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], the agenda of the Provisional Government included the emancipation (''dezrobire'') of the Roma as one of the main social demands. By the 1850s the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society, and the law from February 1856 emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Djuvara/&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Walachia.png|thumb|The present-day [[Counties of Romania|counties]] comprising Wallachia]]

With an area of approximately {{convert|77000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Wallachia is situated north of the [[Danube]] (and of present-day [[Bulgaria]]), east of [[Serbia]] and south of the [[Southern Carpathians]], and is traditionally divided between [[Muntenia]] in the east (as the political center, Muntenia is often understood as being synonymous with Wallachia), and [[Oltenia]] (a former [[Ban (title)|banat]]) in the west. The division line between the two is the [[Olt River]].

Wallachia's traditional border with [[Moldavia]] coincided with the [[Milcov River (Siret)|Milcov River]] for most of its length. To the east, over the Danube north-south bend, Wallachia neighbours [[Dobruja]] ([[Northern Dobruja]]). Over the Carpathians, Wallachia shared a border with [[Transylvania]]; [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian princes]] have for long held possession of areas north of the line ([[Amlaș]], [[Ciceu]], [[Făgăraș]], and [[Hațeg]]), which are generally not considered part of Wallachia proper.

The capital city changed over time, from [[Câmpulung]] to [[Curtea de Argeș]], then to [[Târgoviște]] and, after the late 17th century, to [[Bucharest]].

'''Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen''' (November 24, 1909 – August 4, 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[logician]]. He made major contributions to the [[foundations of mathematics]], [[proof theory]], especially on [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]]. He died of starvation in a Soviet prison camp in [[Prague]] in 1945, having been interned as a German national after the [[Second World War]].

==Life and career==
Gentzen was a student of [[Paul Bernays]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Bernays was fired as &quot;non-[[Aryan]]&quot; in April 1933 and therefore [[Hermann Weyl]] formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the [[Sturmabteilung]] in November 1933 although he was by no means compelled to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. In 1935, he corresponded with [[Abraham Fraenkel]] in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers' union as one who &quot;keeps contacts to the [[Chosen People]].&quot; In 1935 and 1936, [[Hermann Weyl]], head of the Göttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.

Between November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of [[David Hilbert]] in Göttingen. Gentzen joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937. In April 1939 Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler]] as part of his academic appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1943 he was a teacher at the german [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.muni.cz/math/biografie/gerhard_gentzen.html Gerhard Gentzen&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at math.muni.cz&lt;/ref&gt; Under a contract from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Gentzen evidently worked for the [[V-2]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentzen was arrested during the [[Prague uprising|citizens uprising]] against the occupying German forces on May 5, 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in [[Prague]] was subsequently handed over to Soviet forces. Because of his past association with the SA, NSDAP and [[National Socialist German Lecturers League|NSD Dozentenbund]], Gentzen was detained in a prison camp, where he died of starvation on August 4, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Menzler-Trott, p. 273 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gentzen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Gentzen's main work was on the foundations of [[mathematics]], in [[proof theory]], specifically [[natural deduction]] and the [[sequent calculus]]. His [[cut-elimination theorem]] is the cornerstone of [[proof-theoretic semantics]], and some philosophical remarks in his &quot;Investigations into Logical Deduction&quot;, together with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later work, constitute the starting point for [[inferential role semantics]].

One of Gentzen's papers had a second publication in the ideological ''[[Deutsche Mathematik]]'' that was founded by [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] who promoted &quot;Aryan&quot; mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tydecks.info/online/math_natur_deu.html#k5#k5 Dipl.Math. Walter Tydecks, Neuere Geschichte der Mathematik in Deutschland (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentzen [[Gentzen's consistency proof|proved the consistency]] of the [[Peano axioms]] in a paper published in 1936. In his [[Habilitation]]sschrift, finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] followed. [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen's proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of [[Ordinal analysis|ordinal proof theory]].

'''Wisdom''', '''sapience''', or '''sagacity''' is the ability to think and act using [[knowledge]], [[experience]], [[understanding]], [[common sense]] and [[insight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wisdom |title=Wisdom |dictionary=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisdom is associated with attributes such as unbiased judgment, [[compassion]], experiential self-knowledge, [[self-transcendence]] and [[non-attachment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and [[virtues]] such as ethics and benevolence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= Walsh2015&gt;{{cite journal |author= Walsh R. |title= What Is wisdom?

This supersedes the doctrine of the [[George W. Bush administration]] set forth in &quot;[[Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations]]&quot; and written under the direction of Air Force General  chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The new doctrine envisions commanders requesting presidential approval to use nuclear weapons to preempt an attack by a nation or a terrorist group using weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/jp3_12fc2.pdf |title=Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft also includes the option of using nuclear weapons to destroy known enemy stockpiles of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapon]]s.

===Pakistan===
{{see also|N-deterrence}}

Pakistan's Foreign Minister [[Shamshad Ahmad]] warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use &quot;any weapon in its arsenal&quot; to defend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdWCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=pakistan+will+use+any+weapon+in+its+arsenal#v=onepage|title=India-Pakistan in War and Peace&amp;nbsp;— J. N. Dixit&amp;nbsp;— Google Books|date=2003-09-02|website=|publisher=|access-date=|isbn=9781134407583|last1=Dixit|first1=J. N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan refuses to adopt a no first use doctrine and indicates that it would launch nuclear weapons even if the other side did not use such weapons first. Pakistan's asymmetric nuclear posture has significant influence on India's ability to retaliate, as shown in [[2001 India Pakistan standoff|2001]] and [[2008 India Pakistan standoff|2008 crises]], when [[non-state actor]]s carried out deadly terrorist attacks on India, only to be met with a relatively subdued response from India. A military spokesperson stated that &quot;Pakistan's threat of nuclear first-use deterred India from seriously considering conventional military strikes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Narang Policy Brief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Narang|first=Vipin|title=Pakistan's Nuclear Posture: Implications for South Asian Stability|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Pakistans_Nuclear_Posture_policy_brief.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2013|newspaper=Harvard Kennedy School, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Policy Brief|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's [[Pakistan National Security Council|National Security Advisor]] [[Sartaj Aziz]] defended the [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|policy of first use]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Council of Foreign Relations&quot;/&gt; Aziz stated that Pakistan's first use doctrine is entirely deterrent in nature. He explained that it was effective after the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]] and argued that if Pakistan had a no first use policy, there would have been a major war between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Council of Foreign Relations&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boies|first1=Mary McInnis|title=Promoting U.S.-Pakistan Relations: Future Challenges and Opportunities|url=http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/promoting-us-pakistan-relations-future-challenges-opportunities/p33514|publisher=Council of Foreign Relations|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Although Israel [[policy of deliberate ambiguity|does not officially confirm or deny]] having nuclear weapons, the country is widely believed to be [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|in possession of them]]. Its continued ambiguous stance puts it in a difficult position since to issue a statement pledging 'no first use' would confirm their possession of nuclear weapons.

Israel has said that it &quot;would not be the first country in the Middle East to formally introduce nuclear weapons into the region.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9822/israels_nuclear_program_and_middle_east_peace.html |publisher=Lionel Beehner |date=February 10, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |title=Israel's Nuclear Program and Middle East Peace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209064933/http://www.cfr.org/publication/9822/israels_nuclear_program_and_middle_east_peace.html |archivedate=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Israel's very existence is threatened, some speculate that Israel would use a &quot;[[Samson Option]],&quot; a &quot;last resort&quot; deterrence strategy of [[massive retaliation]] with nuclear weapons, should the State of Israel be substantially damaged and/or near destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy,'' Random House, 1991, pp. 42, 136-137, 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avner Cohen, Israel and the Bomb, Columbia University Press, 1998, pp. 2, 7, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avner Cohen, &quot;Israel's Nuclear Opacity: a Political Genealogy,&quot; published in The Dynamics of Middle East Nuclear Proliferation, pp. 187-212, edited by Steven L. Spiegel, Jennifer D. Kibbe and Elizabeth G. Matthews. Symposium Series, Volume 66, The Edwin Mellen Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Israeli historian [[Avner Cohen]], Israel's policy on nuclear weapons, which was set down in 1966, revolves around four &quot;red lines&quot; which could lead to an Israeli nuclear response:

* A successful military penetration into populated areas within Israel's borders.
* The destruction of the [[Israeli Air Force]].
* Israeli cities being subjected to massive and devastating aerial bombardment, chemical attacks, or biological attacks.
* The use of nuclear weapons against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Avner (1998a), Israel and the Bomb, New York: Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-10482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{main|North Korea and weapons of mass destruction}}
North Korea's stated policy position is that nuclear weapons &quot;will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike&quot;, but if there is an &quot;attempt to have recourse to military force against us&quot; North Korea may use their &quot;most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them&quot;.&lt;ref name=38north-20201013&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.38north.org/2020/10/kjuspeech101320/ |title=Kim Jong Un's October 10 Speech: More Than Missiles |publisher=The Henry L.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Burton was born Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 in a house at 2 Dan-y-bont in [[Pontrhydyfen]]&lt;!--Neath Port Talbot did not exist in 1925, Glamorgan is correct--&gt;, [[Glamorgan]], Wales.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|pp=6–8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Pontrhydyfen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://richardburtonmuseum.weebly.com/pontrhydyfen.html | title=Pontrhydyfen | publisher=The Richard Burton Museum | accessdate=14 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414100404/http://richardburtonmuseum.weebly.com/pontrhydyfen.html | archive-date=14 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the twelfth of thirteen children born into the Welsh-speaking family of Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (1876–1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (née Thomas; 1883–1927).{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1pp=6–7|2a1=Parish|2y=2011|2p=26|3a1=Jedlicka|3y=2011|3p=83}} Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner's Arms, which was also the place where she met and married her husband.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=23|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=5}} According to biographer [[Melvyn Bragg]], Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a &quot;twelve-pints-a-day man&quot; who sometimes went off on drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that &quot;he looked very much like me&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=3}} He remembered his mother to be &quot;a very strong woman&quot; and &quot;a religious soul with fair hair and a beautiful face&quot;.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1p=3|2a1=Munn|2y=2014|2p=12}}
[[File:Miners Arms, Pontrhydyfen - geograph.org.uk - 3798450.jpg|thumb|right|The Miner's Arms at Pontrhydyfen where Richard Burton's parents met and married.]]
Richard was barely two years old when his mother died on 31 October, six days after the birth of Graham, the family's thirteenth child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pontrhydyfen&quot;/&gt; Edith's death was a result of [[postpartum infections]]; Richard believed it occurred due to &quot;hygiene neglect&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=7}} According to biographer [[Michael Munn]], Edith &quot;was fastidiously clean&quot;, but that her exposure to the dust from the coal mines resulted in her death.{{Sfn|Munn|2014|p=15}} Following Edith's death, Richard's elder sister Cecilia, whom he affectionately addressed as &quot;Cis&quot;, and her husband Elfed James, also a miner, took him under their care. Richard lived with Cis, Elfed and their two daughters, Marian and Rhianon, in their three bedroom terraced cottage on 73 Caradoc Street, [[Taibach]], a [[suburb]]an district in [[Port Talbot]], which Bragg describes as &quot;a tough steel town, [[English language|English-speaking]], grind and grime&quot;.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1pp=7, 10, 11|2a1=Munn|2y=2014|2p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://richardburtonmuseum.weebly.com/personal.html | title=A Selection Of Richard Burton Personal Items | publisher=The Richard Burton Museum | accessdate=15 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415014048/http://richardburtonmuseum.weebly.com/personal.html | archive-date=15 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard remained forever grateful and loving to Cis throughout his life, later going on to say: &quot;When my mother died she, my sister, had become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been&amp;nbsp;... I was immensely proud of her&amp;nbsp;... she felt all tragedies except her own&quot;. Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|pp=7, 10}} Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and [[rugby union]] player, Ifor &quot;ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand&quot;. He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1pp=12–13, 17|2a1=Jenkins|2a2=Rogers|2y=1993|2p=7}} Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he &quot;would rather have played for Wales at [[Cardiff Arms Park]] than Hamlet at [[The Old Vic]]&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=17}} The Welsh rugby union centre, [[Bleddyn Williams]] believed Richard &quot;had distinct possibilities as a player&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=18}}

From the age of five to eight, Richard was educated at the [[List of schools in Neath Port Talbot#Primary schools|Eastern Primary School]] while he attended the Boys' segment of the same school from eight to twelve years old.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=26}}&lt;ref name=&quot;visitnpt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitnpt.co.uk/pdf/RB_TrailsLeafletPrinted.pdf | title=Richard Burton Trails | publisher=visitnpt.co.uk | accessdate=15 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415024251/http://www.visitnpt.co.uk/pdf/RB_TrailsLeafletPrinted.pdf | archive-date=15 April 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a scholarship exam for admission into Port Talbot Secondary School in March 1937 and passed it.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=17–18}} Biographer [[Hollis Alpert]] notes that both Daddy Ni and Ifor considered Richard's education to be &quot;of paramount importance&quot; and planned to send him to the [[University of Oxford]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=24–25}} Richard became the first member of his family to go to secondary school.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=24–26}} He displayed an excellent speaking and singing voice since childhood, even winning an [[eisteddfod]] prize as a [[boy soprano]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=26}} During his tenure at Port Talbot Secondary School,{{efn|Now known as the [[Dyffryn School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;visitnpt&quot;/&gt;}} Richard also showed immense interest in reading poetry as well as English and [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;visitnpt&quot;/&gt;{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=21}} He earned pocket money by running messages, hauling horse manure, and delivering newspapers.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=25}}

===The Philip Burton years===
Richard was bolstered by winning the Eisteddfod Prize and wanted to repeat his success. He chose to sing Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s &quot;Orpheus with his Lute&quot; (1866), which biographer Alpert thought &quot;a difficult composition&quot;. He requested the help of his schoolmaster, [[Philip Burton (theatre director)|Philip Burton]],{{efn|Philip taught Arithmetic and English at Port Talbot Secondary School in addition to holding plays for the school.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=27–28}}}} but his voice cracked during their practice sessions. This incident marked the beginning of his association with Philip.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=27}} Philip later recalled, &quot;His voice was tough to begin with but with constant practice it became memorably beautiful.&quot;{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=37}} Richard made his first foray into theatre with a minor role in his school's production of the Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Apple Cart]]''. He decided to leave school by the end of 1941 and work as a miner as Elfed was not fit due to illness. He worked for the local wartime [[Co-operatives UK|Co-operative]] committee, handing out supplies in exchange for coupons. He also simultaneously considered other professions for his future, including boxing, religion and singing. It was also during this period that Richard took up smoking and drinking despite being underage.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=29–30}}
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FAE7B5|quote=One day in 1964 when Richard [Burton] was playing in ''Hamlet'' on Broadway, he and I were interviewed jointly in a private corner of an Eighth Avenue bar and restaurant much frequented by theatre people. We had a live audience of one, Richard's wife, Elizabeth Taylor. One of the questions aimed at me was, &quot;How did you come to adopt him?&quot; [...] Richard jumped in with &quot;He didn't adopt me; I adopted him.&quot; There was much truth in that.

When he joined the Port Talbot Squadron 499 of the [[Air Training Corps]] section of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as a cadet, he re-encountered Philip, who was the squadron commander.

In autumn of 1943, Philip planned to adopt Richard, but was not able to do so as he was 20 days too young to be 21 years older than his ward, a legal requirement. As a result, Richard became Philip's legal [[ward (law)|ward]] and changed his surname to &quot;Richard Burton&quot;, after Philip's own surname, by means of [[deed poll]], which Richard's father accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Independent&quot;/&gt;{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=41}} It was also in 1943 that Richard qualified for admission into a University after excelling in the School Certificate Examination.

==Career==

===Early career and service in the RAF (1943–1947)===
In 1943, Burton played Professor Henry Higgins in a school production of another Shaw play directed by Philip, ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''. The role won him favourable reviews and caught the attention of the dramatist, [[Emlyn Williams]], who offered Burton a small role of the lead character's elder brother, Glan, in his play ''The Druid's Rest''.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=35–37}} The play debuted at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] on 22 November 1943, and later premiered in [[St Martin's Theatre]], London in January 1944. Burton thought the role was &quot;a nothing part&quot; and that he &quot;hardly spoke at all&quot;. He was paid ten pounds a week for playing the role ({{Inflation|UK|10|1944|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), which was &quot;three times what the miners got&quot;.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=38–39}} Alpert states that the play garnered mixed critical reviews,  but James Redfern of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' took notice of Burton's performance and wrote: &quot;In a wretched part, Richard Burton showed exceptional ability.&quot; Burton noted that single sentence from Redfern changed his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=39|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=44}}

During his tenure at Exeter College, Burton featured as &quot;the complicated sex-driven puritan&quot; [[Angelo (Measure for Measure)|Angelo]] in the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]]'s 1944 production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]''.{{efn|Originally, Burton was placed as an understudy for the part of Angelo after impressing Coghill by demonstrating and reciting the &quot;[[To be, or not to be]]&quot; [[soliloquy]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''. The RAF officer who was to play the role of Angelo, was called back to active service and Burton was selected for the role. Philip sent letters of advice to Burton on how to play Angelo and came to London to oversee the rehearsals.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=40|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=50}}}} The play was directed by Burton's English literature professor, [[Nevill Coghill]], and was performed at the college in the presence of an audience of [[West End theatre]] luminaries such as [[John Gielgud]], [[Terence Rattigan]] and [[Binkie Beaumont]]. On Burton's performance, fellow actor and friend, [[Robert Hardy]] recalled, &quot;There were moments when he totally commanded the audience by this stillness. And the voice which would sing like a violin and with a bass that could shake the floor.&quot; Gielgud appreciated Burton's performance and Beaumont, who knew about Burton's work in ''The Druid's Rest'', suggested that he &quot;look him up&quot; after completing his service in the RAF if he still wanted to pursue acting as a profession.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1pp=40–41|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2pp=50–51}}

In late 1944, Burton successfully completed his six-month scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, and went to the RAF classification examinations held in [[Torquay]] to train as a pilot. He was disqualified for pilot training due to his eyesight being below par, and was classified as a navigator trainee.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=41|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=51}} He served the RAF as navigator for three years,{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=44}} during which he performed an assignment as [[Aircraftman#History|Aircraftman 1st Class]] in a [[Wiltshire]]-based RAF Hospital.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=43}} Burton's habits of drinking and smoking increased during this period; he was involved in a brief casual affair with actress [[Eleanor Summerfield]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=41–43}}{{efn|Burton worked with Summerfield in two versions of Emlyn Williams' play, ''[[The Corn Is Green]]'' for [[BBC]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=43}} The first one was a radio adaptation which was broadcast on 27 January 1945, while the other was a television adaptation by [[BBC Television]] that was premiered on 15 September 1946.

In 1948, Burton moved to London to make contact with [[H. M. Tennent|H. M.

While touring with the cast and crew members of [[Wynyard Browne]]'s ''Dark Summer'', Burton was called by Emlyn Williams for a screen test for his film, ''[[The Last Days of Dolwyn]]'' (1949).{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=63}} Burton performed the screen test for the role of Gareth, which Williams wrote especially for him, and was subsequently selected when Williams sent him a telegram that quoted a line from ''The Corn Is Green'' {{mdash}} &quot;You have won the scholarship.&quot; This led to Burton making his mainstream film debut.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=63}} Filming took place during the summer and early autumn months of 1948. It was on the sets of this film that Burton was introduced by Williams to [[Sybil Christopher|Sybil Williams]], whom he married on 5 February 1949 at a register office in Kensington.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=46–48}} ''The Last Days of Dolwyn'' opened to generally positive critical reviews.

Pleased with the feedback Burton received for his performance in ''The Last Days of Dolwyn'', the film's co-producer [[Alexander Korda]] offered him a contract at a stipend of £100 a week, which he signed. The contract enabled Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=53}} Throughout the late 1940s and early 50s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as ''[[Now Barabbas]]'' (1949) with [[Richard Greene]] and [[Kathleen Harrison]], ''[[The Woman with No Name]]'' (1950) opposite [[Phyllis Calvert]], ''[[Waterfront (1950 film)|Waterfront]]'' (1950) with Harrison; he had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in ''[[Green Grow the Rushes (film)|Green Grow the Rushes]]'' (1951) alongside [[Honor Blackman]].{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=Appendices: Films}} His performance in ''Now Barabbas'' received positive feedback from critics. [[C. A.

Burton began 1952 by starring alongside [[Noel Willman]] in the title role of [[Emmanuel Roblès]] adventure ''Montserrat'', which opened on 8 April at the Lyric Hammersmith.

At a party held at Simmons' residence in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]] to celebrate the success of ''The Robe'', Burton met [[Elizabeth Taylor]] for the first time.

Notwithstanding, Burton began his thirty-nine-week tenure at The Old Vic by rehearsing for ''Hamlet'' in July 1953, with Philip providing expert coaching on how to make Hamlet's character match Burton's dynamic acting style.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=92}} Burton reunited with Bloom, who played [[Ophelia]].{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=94}} ''Hamlet'' opened at the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|Assembly Hall]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in September 1953 as part of The Old Vic season during the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=Appendices: Theatre}} The play and Burton's Hamlet were, on the whole, well received, with critics describing his interpretation of the character as &quot;moody, virile and baleful&quot; and that he had &quot;dash, attack and verve&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=95}} Burton's Hamlet was quite popular with the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers as they were quite taken with the aggressiveness with which he portrayed the role. Burton also received appreciation from [[Winston Churchill]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=69}} Gielgud was not too happy with Burton's Hamlet and asked him while both were backstage: &quot;Shall I go ahead and wait until you're better?... ah, I mean ready?&quot; Burton picked up the hint and infused some of Gielgud's traits to his own in later performances as Hamlet.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=70}}{{efn|Gielgud's biographer Jonathan Croall opines Gielgud's dissatisfaction may be due to a remark Burton made that his portrayal of Hamlet was &quot;a sort of unconscious imitation of Gielgud&quot;.{{Sfn|Croall|2000|p=441}}}} A greater success followed in the form of the Roman General [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus]] in ''[[Coriolanus]]''. At first, Burton refused to play Coriolanus as he didn't like the character's initial disdain for the poor and the downtrodden. [[Michael Benthall]], who was renowned for his association with [[Tyrone Guthrie]] in a 1944 production of ''Hamlet'', sought Philip's help to entice Burton into accepting it. Philip convinced Burton by making him realise that it was Coriolanus' &quot;lack of ambivalence&quot; which made him an admirable character.{{Sfnm|1a1=Babula|1y=1981|1p=58|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=96–97|3a1=Tynan|3y=2012|3p=109}} Burton received even better reviews for Coriolanus than Hamlet.

Burton's other roles for the season were [[Sir Toby Belch]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Caliban]] in ''The Tempest'' and [[Philip of Cognac]] in ''[[King John (play)|King John]]''.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=97}} All five of Burton's plays were directed by Benthall; three of those plays featured Bloom.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=Appendices: Theatre}} While Belch was considered &quot;disappointing&quot; due to Burton not putting on the proper make-up for the part, his reviews for Caliban and Philip of Cognac were positive.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=97–98}} Alpert believed Burton's presence made the 1953–54 season of The Old Vic a commercial success.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=69}} Burton was an ardent admirer of poet [[Dylan Thomas]] since his boyhood days.

After The Old Vic season ended, Burton's contract with Fox required him to do three more films.

Shortly after the release of ''Prince of Players'', Burton met director [[Robert Rossen]], who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' (1949). Rossen planned to cast Burton in ''[[Alexander the Great (1956 film)|Alexander the Great]]'' (1956) as the eponymous character. Burton accepted Rossen's offer after the director reassured him he had been studying the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] king for two years to make sure the film was historically accurate. Burton was loaned by Fox to the film's production company [[United Artists]], which paid him a fee of $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1956|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}). ''Alexander the Great'' was made mostly in [[Spain]] during February 1955 and July 1955 on a budget of $6&amp;nbsp;million. The film reunited Burton with Bloom and it was also the first film he made with her. Bloom played the role of [[Barsine]], the daughter of [[Artabazos II of Phrygia]], and one of Alexander's three wives. [[Fredric March]], [[Danielle Darrieux]], [[Stanley Baker]], [[Michael Hordern]] and [[William Squire]] were respectively cast as [[Philip II of Macedon]], [[Olympias]], [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], [[Demosthenes]] and [[Aeschines]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=72–73|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=101–102}}

After the completion of ''Alexander the Great'', Burton had high hopes for a favourable reception of the &quot;intelligent epic&quot;, and went back to complete his next assignment for Fox, [[Jean Negulesco]]'s ''[[The Rains of Ranchipur]]'' (1955). In this remake of Fox's own 1939 film ''[[The Rains Came]]'', Burton played a [[Hindu]] doctor, Rama Safti, who falls in love with Lady Edwina Esketh ([[Lana Turner]]), an invitee of the Maharani of the fictional town of Ranchipur.&lt;ref name=&quot;sterritt1955&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/87641/The-Rains-of-Ranchipur/articles.html | title=The Rains of Ranchipur (1955) - TCM Article | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=21 April 2016 | first=David | last=Sterritt | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421071238/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/87641/The-Rains-of-Ranchipur/articles.html | archive-date=21 April 2016 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton faced the same troubles with playing character roles as before with Belch.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=103}} ''The Rains of Ranchipur'' released on 16 December 1955, three months before ''Alexander the Great'' rolled out on 28 March 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17416/Alexander-the-Great/ | title=Alexander the Great&amp;nbsp;— Overview | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=21 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421090030/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17416/Alexander-the-Great/ | archive-date=21 April 2016 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/87641/The-Rains-of-Ranchipur/ | title=The Rains of Ranchipur&amp;nbsp;— Overview | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=21 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421090036/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/87641/The-Rains-of-Ranchipur/ | archive-date=21 April 2016 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Burton's expectations, both the films were critical and commercial failures, and he rued his decision to act in them.&lt;ref name=&quot;sterritt1955&quot;/&gt;{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=73–75|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=102–104}} ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine critic derided ''The Rains of Ranchipur'' and even went as far as to say Richard was hardly noticeable in the film.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=75}} [[A.

Burton returned to The Old Vic to perform ''Henry V'' for a second time. The Benthall-directed production opened in December 1955 to glowing reviews and was a much-needed triumph for Burton.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=104–105}} Tynan made it official by famously saying Burton was now &quot;the next successor to Olivier&quot;.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=74|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=105}} The reviewer from ''[[The Times]]'' began by pointing out the deficiencies in Burton's previous rendition of the character in 1951 before stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Burton's progress as an actor is such that already he is able to make good all the lacks of a few short years ago ... what was greatly metallic has been transformed into a steely strength which becomes the martial ring and hard brilliance of the patriotic verse. There now appears a romantic sense of a high kingly mission and the clear cognisance of the capacity to fulfil it ... the whole performance&amp;nbsp;— a mostly satisfying one&amp;nbsp;— is firmly under the control of the imagination.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=105}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1956, the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' honoured Burton by presenting to him its [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#Best Actor|Theatre Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Henry V.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Bragg|2y=1988|2p=104}} His success in and as Henry V led him to be called the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot;.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=104}} ''Henry V'' was followed by Benthall's adaptation of ''[[Othello]]'' in February 1956, where he alternated on successive openings between the roles of [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and [[Iago]] with [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]]. As Othello, Burton received both praise for his dynamism and criticism with being less poetical with his dialogues, while he was acclaimed as Iago.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|pp=104, 106}}

Burton's stay at The Old Vic was cut short when he was approached by the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] director [[Roberto Rossellini]] for Fox's ''[[Sea Wife]]'' (1957), a drama set in [[World War II]] about a nun and three men marooned on an island after the ship they travel on is torpedoed by a [[U-boat]]. [[Joan Collins]], who played the nun, was his co-star. Burton's role was that of an RAF officer who develops romantic feelings for the nun.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=75}} Rossellini was informed by Zanuck not to have any kissing scenes between Burton and Collins, which Rossellini found unnatural; this led to him walking out of the film and being replaced by Bob McNaught, one of the executive producers.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=76}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89334/Sea-Wife/trivia.html | title=Sea Wife&amp;nbsp;— Trivia | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | accessdate=21 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421124332/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89334/Sea-Wife/trivia.html | archive-date=21 April 2016 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Collins, Burton had a &quot;take-the-money-and-run attitude&quot; toward the film.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=75–77}} ''Sea Wife'' was not a successful venture, with biographer Munn observing that his salary was the only positive feature that came from the film.{{Sfnm|1a1=Monaco|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Munn|2y=2014|2p=110}} Philip saw it and said he was &quot;ashamed&quot; that it added another insult to injury in Burton's career.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=111}}

After ''Sea Wife'', Burton next appeared as the British Army Captain Jim Leith in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Bitter Victory]]'' (1957).{{Sfn|Munn|2014|p=113}} Burton admired Ray's ''[[Rebel Without A Cause]]'' (1955) and was excited about working with him,{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=78}} but unfortunately despite positive feedback, ''Bitter Victory'' tanked as well.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1p=119|2a1=Munn|2y=2014|2p=113}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bitter_victory/ | title=Bitter Victory (1957) | website=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=21 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211224128/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bitter_victory | archive-date=11 February 2015 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1957, Burton had no further offers in his kitty. He could not return to the UK because of his self-imposed exile from taxation, and his fortunes in film were dwindling.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=78}} It was then that [[film producer]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Milton Sperling]] offered Burton to star alongside [[Helen Hayes]] and [[Susan Strasberg]] in [[Patricia Moyes]]' adaptation of Jean Anoulih's play, ''Time Remembered'' (''[[Léocadia]]'' in the original French version).{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1p=78|2a1=Hischak|2y=2009|2p=469}} Sensing an opportunity for a career resurgence, Burton readily agreed to do the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a [[Hatmaking|milliner]] named Amanda (Strasberg).{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=78}} It was on 10 September 1957, a day before he left for New York, that Sybil gave birth to their first child, [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]].{{Sfn|Munn|2014|p=113}} ''Time Remembered'' was well received on its opening nights at Broadway's [[Morosco Theatre]] and also at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].{{Sfn|Ferris|1981|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/Richard-Burton-Susan-Strasberg-Time-Remembered-Playbill-1957-Washington-HZ-/291724349422?hash=item43ec204fee | title=Richard Burton Susan Strasberg &quot;Time Remembered&quot; Playbill 1957 Washington HZ | publisher=[[eBay]] | date=8 October 1957 | accessdate=22 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422124653/http://www.ebay.com/itm/Richard-Burton-Susan-Strasberg-Time-Remembered-Playbill-1957-Washington-HZ-/291724349422?hash=item43ec204fee | archive-date=22 April 2016 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play went on to have a good run of 248 performances for six months.

In 1958, Burton appeared with [[Yvonne Furneaux]] in [[DuPont Show of the Month]]'s 90-minute television adaptation of [[Emily Brontë]]'s classic novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' as [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]].{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=Appendices: Television}} The film, directed by [[Daniel Petrie]],{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=83}} aired on 9 May 1958 on [[CBS]] with Burton garnering plaudits from both the critics and Philip, who thought he was &quot;magnificent&quot; in it.{{Sfn|Bragg|1988|p=123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.paleycenter.org/p-70-tv-countdown-50 | title=The Paley Center's Countdown to the 70th Anniversary of Television: TV Facts You Will Want to Know! | publisher=[[Paley Center for Media]] | accessdate=13 March 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313093703/https://www.paleycenter.org/p-70-tv-countdown-50 | archive-date=13 March 2018 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton next featured as Jimmy Porter, &quot;an angry young man&quot; role, in the film version of [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by [[Tony Richardson]], again with Claire Bloom as co-star.

Burton made a triumphant return to the stage with [[Moss Hart]]'s 1960 Broadway production of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' as [[King Arthur]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Bragg|1y=1988|1p=136|2a1=Monaco|2y=1991|2p=89}} The play, written by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]], had [[Julie Andrews]] fresh from her triumph in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' playing [[Guinevere]], and [[Robert Goulet]] as [[Lancelot]] completing the love triangle.{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|p=90}} [[Roddy McDowall]] played the villainous [[Mordred]].{{Sfn|Alpert|1986|pp=90–91}} Hart first came up with the proposal to Burton after learning from Lerner about his ability to sing.

Burton had accepted Cohen's offer under the condition that Gielgud would direct it, which he convened to him. Gielgud agreed and soon production began in January 1964 after Burton had completed his work in ''Becket'' and ''The Night of the Iguana''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Alpert|1y=1986|1pp=131–132|2a1=Croall|2y=2000|2p=442|3a1=Morley|3y=2010|3p=494}}{{efn|O'Toole's version of how Burton came to work in ''Hamlet'' under Gielgud  was a little different, but not conflicting according to Alpert.

Burton won the first toss and chose Gielgud and New York City while O'Toole won the second toss, selecting Olivier and London.{{Sfn|Croall|2000|pp=441–442}}}} Taking into account Burton's dislike for wearing period clothing, as well as fellow actor [[Harley Granville-Barker]]’s notion that the play was best approached as a &quot;permanent rehearsal&quot;, Gielgud decided for ''Hamlet'' to be performed in a 'rehearsal' version with an incomplete set with the actors performing wearing their own clothes. Unaccustomed to this freedom, the cast found it hard to select the appropriate clothes and wore different attire day by day. After the first performance in Toronto, Gielgud decreed that the actors must wear capes as he felt it &quot;lacked colour&quot;.

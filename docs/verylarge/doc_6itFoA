There is also a large [[Odia people|Odia]] population. A community of [[Bengalis]] has existed in major cities since the times of the [[British Raj]]. They are associated with education, industry and services.

=== Status of women ===
Chhattisgarh has a high female-male [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] (991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chhattisgarh, At a glance|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/Chhattishgarh/2.%20Chhattishgarh%20Figures%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|publisher=Census 2011, Ministry of Home Affair, India|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813034404/http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/Chhattishgarh/2.%20Chhattishgarh%20Figures%20at%20a%20glance.pdf|archive-date=13 August 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking at the fifth position among other states of India. Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisgarh is the 10th-largest state in India.

The gender ratio (number of females per 1,000 males) has been steadily declining over 20th century in Chhattisgarh. But it is conspicuous that Chhattisgarh always had a better female-to-male ratio compared with national average.

Rural women, although poor, are independent, better organised, and socially outspoken. According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen quite clearly in the social and cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Structure in Chhattisgarh |url=http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720005404/http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state hosts many religious sects such as [[Satnampanth]], [[Kabirpanth]], [[Ramnami Samaj]] and others. [[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha]]charya, increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.

Chhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said &quot;I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.&quot; Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, &quot;nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy.&quot;

The [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.

=== Literature ===
Chhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts—all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.

=== Crafts ===
Chhattisgarh is known for &quot;Kosa silk&quot; and &quot;Dhokra or Bell metal art&quot;. Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabari Chhattisgarh State Emporium, Raipur.

=== Dance ===
Panthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.

Panthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archivedate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles of narration in Pandavani, Vedamati, and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style, the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters.  Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan [[Teejan Bai]] is most popular artist of Pandavani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandawani|url=http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|accessdate=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830152418/http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|archive-date=30 August 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Las Vegas'''  ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;The Meadows&quot;), officially the '''City of Las Vegas''' and often known simply as '''Vegas''', is the [[List of United States cities by population|28th-most populous city]] in the [[United States]], the most populous city in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Nevada]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]]. The city anchors the [[Las Vegas Valley]] metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major [[resort town|resort city]], known primarily for its [[gambling]], shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and [[nightlife]]. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.

The city bills itself as [[The Entertainment Capital of the World]], and is famous for its mega casino-hotels and associated activities. It is a top three destination in the United States for business conventions and a global leader in the [[hospitality industry]], claiming more [[AAA Five Diamond Award|AAA Five Diamond]] hotels than any other city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/21/top-50-destinations-for-meeting-planners/2681695/ | work=USA Today | first1=Charisse | last1=Jones | title=Top convention destinations: Orlando, Chicago, Las Vegas | date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2014/01/17/aaa-five-diamond-hotels-restaurants/4496183|title=AAA chooses Five Diamond hotels, restaurants for 2014|author=Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY|date=January 17, 2014|publisher=Usatoday.com|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcareers.com/us/resourcecenter/tabid/306/articleid/1175/default.aspx|title=Top 5 Cities to Get Hired in Hospitality|publisher=Hcareers.com|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;TravelandTourism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by [[Chicago]] in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the 21st century, and according to estimates from the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city had 651,319 residents in 2019,&lt;ref name=&quot;City 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Las Vegas city, Nevada; count revision of 01-07-2018| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Las Vegas city, Nevada| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city (&quot;Las Vegas&quot; in this case) is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits. In the case of Las Vegas, this especially applies to the areas on and near the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which is actually located within the unincorporated communities of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vegas not alone in wanting in on .vegas  |author=Joe Schoenmann |author-link=Joe Schoenmann |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=February 3, 2010 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/03/vegas-not-alone-wanting-vegas/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=County Turns 100 July 1, Dubbed 'Centennial Day' |url=http://www.accessclarkcounty.com/depts/public_communications/news_releases/pages/countyturns100july1.aspx |publisher=[[Clark County, Nevada]] |date= June 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

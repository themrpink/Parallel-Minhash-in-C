Dobson frequently appears as a guest on the [[Fox News Channel]].&lt;ref name=fox1 /&gt;

==Personal life==
 
Dobson married the former Shirley Deere on August 26, 1960. The couple have two children, Danae and Ryan. Ryan Dobson (born in California in 1970) graduated from [[Biola University]] in [[La Mirada, California]]; he is a public speaker with specialization on issues relating to youth and the [[anti-abortion]] movement. He was [[adoption|adopted]] by the Dobsons and is an ardent supporter of adoption, especially adoption of troubled children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambassadoradvertising1&quot; /&gt;

===Degrees, positions, and awards===
Dobson attended [[Point Loma Nazarene University]], where he was team captain of the tennis team, most valuable player in 1956 and 1958, and later returned to coach in 1968-1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pointloma.edu/Athletics/MensTennis/Archives/Year_Coach_Record_MVP.htm |title=Year/Coach/Record/MVP |accessdate=2008-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210003656/http://www.pointloma.edu/Athletics/MensTennis/Archives/Year_Coach_Record_MVP.htm |archivedate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson earned a PhD in [[child development]] from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1967. He was an Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Southern California School of Medicine]] for 14 years. He spent 17 years on the staff of the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles in the Division of Child Development and Medical Genetics. Dobson is a licensed psychologist in the State of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychlicence&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/WLLQRYNA$LCEV2.QueryView?P_LICENSE_NUMBER=3203&amp;P_LTE_ID=725 |title=Psychologist license |work=State of California |accessdate=2011-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719133621/http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/WLLQRYNA$LCEV2.QueryView?P_LICENSE_NUMBER=3203&amp;P_LTE_ID=725 |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of Presidents and Attorneys General,&lt;ref name=&quot;PFAW&quot; /&gt; Dobson has also served on government advisory panels and testified at several government hearings. He was given the &quot;Layman of the Year&quot; award by the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] in 1982, &quot;The Children's Friend&quot; honor by Childhelp USA (an advocate agency against [[child abuse]]) in 1987, and the Humanitarian Award by the [[California Psychological Association]] in 1988. In 2005, Dobson received an honorary doctorate (his 16th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indwes.edu/alumni/graphics/2005PRtriangle.pdf |format=PDF |title=Triangle; President's Report 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414081401/http://www.indwes.edu/alumni/graphics/2005PRtriangle.pdf |archivedate=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from [[Indiana Wesleyan University]] and was inducted into IWU's ''Society of World Changers'', while speaking at the university's Academic Convocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutFF&quot; /&gt;

In 2008, Dobson's ''Focus on the Family'' program was nominated for induction into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Devon |url=http://www.citizenlink.org/CLtopstories/A000007319.cfm |title=Dr. Dobson's Broadcast Nominated to Radio Hall of Fame |date=2008-05-01 |publisher=Citizenlink.org |accessdate=2008-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503062441/http://www.citizenlink.org/CLtopstories/A000007319.cfm |archive-date=May 3, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations were made by the 157 members of the Hall of Fame and voting on inductees was handed over to the public using online voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/radio_38491___article.html/dobson_fame.html |title=Dobson garners hall of fame honor |date=2008-07-21 |last=Barna |first=Mark |work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=2008-07-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727000847/http://www.gazette.com/articles/radio_38491___article.html/dobson_fame.html |archivedate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nomination drew the ire of [[gay rights]] activists, who attempted to have the program removed from the nominee list and to vote for other nominees to prevent it from being approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000007803.cfm |title=Dr. Dobson Blasted by Gay Activist |date=2008-07-11 |publisher=Citizenlink.org |accessdate=2008-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817125658/http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000007803.cfm |archive-date=August 17, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/two-launches-drive-keep-james/story.aspx?guid=%7B689964E1-58B4-447C-8035-A4E5A019854E%7D&amp;dist=hppr |title=TWO Launches Drive to Keep James Dobson Out of the Radio Hall of Fame |date=2008-07-09 |last=Besen |first=Wayne |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the program garnered enough votes and was subsequently inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiohof.org/pioneer/focusonthefamily.htm |title=Focus On The Family |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707190532/http://www.radiohof.org/pioneer/focusonthefamily.htm |archivedate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social views==

=== Views on marriage ===
James Dobson is a strong proponent of marriage defined as &quot;one where husband and wife are lawfully married, are committed to each other for life,&quot; and have a [[homemaking|homemaker]] mother and [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James C. |last1=Dobson |first2=Gary L. |last2=Bauer |title=Children at Risk |year=1994 |pages=119, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, women are not deemed inferior to men because both are created in God's image, but each gender has biblically mandated roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dobson |first=James |title=Why Boys Are So Different |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |year=2001 |url=http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000716.html |accessdate=2007-09-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006062936/http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000716.html |archivedate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends that married women with children under the age of 18 focus on mothering, rather than work outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://family.custhelp.com./cgi-bin/family.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=974 |title=Is it important for mothers to stay home during the teen years? |publisher=Focus on the Family |first=James |last=Dobson |accessdate=2008-06-20}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 book ''[[Marriage Under Fire]]'', Dobson suggests that heterosexual marriage rates in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have been falling, and that this is due to the recognition of [[same-sex relationship]]s by those countries during the 1990s. He remarks that the &quot;institution of marriage in those countries is rapidly dying&quot; as a result, with most young people [[cohabitation|cohabiting]] or choosing to remain single (living alone) and illegitimacy rates rising in some Norwegian counties up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnmarriage.com/docs/Why%20We%20Must%20Win%20This%20Battle.pdf |title=Why We Must Win This Battle |website=mnmarriage.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104739/http://www.mnmarriage.com/docs/Why%20We%20Must%20Win%20This%20Battle.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson writes that &quot;every civilization in the world&quot; has been built upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James C. ''Marriage under fire: why we must win this war.'' Sisters, Or. : Multnomah Publishers, 2004. quoted in McManus, Mike and Harriet McManus.

New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that homosexuality is neither a choice nor genetic, but is caused by external factors during early childhood.&lt;ref name=msnbc05&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/22/lkl.01.html |title=Interview With Dr. James Dobson |first=Larry |last=King |publisher=CNN |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629135156/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/22/lkl.01.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He anecdotally cites as evidence the life of actress [[Anne Heche]],&lt;ref name=msnbc06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8234503 |title='Healed' by God: Evangelical group sponsors conference on nature of gays |first=Alex |last=Johnson |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stranger05 /&gt; who was previously in a relationship with [[Ellen DeGeneres]]. Criticizing &quot;the realities of judicial tyranny,&quot; Dobson has written that &quot;[t]here is no issue today that is more significant to our culture than the defense of the family. Not even the war on terror eclipses it.&quot;{{Citation needed|date= October 2015}}

Critics have stated that Dobson's views on homosexuality do not represent the [[Homosexuality and psychology|mainstream views]] of the mental health community, with Dan Gilgoff referring to the positions of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]] on homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilgoff |first=Dan |title=The Jesus Machine How James Dobson, Focus on the Family, and Evangelical America Are Winning the Culture War |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MdeHmAEACAAJ |year=2008 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |isbn=9780312378448 |pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dudley |first=Jonathan |title=Broken Words The Misfortunes of Science and Scripture in Evangelical Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UHIWXheyNuEC |year=2011 |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=9780385525268 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on schooling===
Focus on the Family supports&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; [[private school]] [[school voucher|vouchers]] and [[tax credit]]s for religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's education, and encourages parents to visit their children's schools to ask questions and to join the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] so that they may voice their opinions.&lt;ref name=&quot;improveSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What can parents do to improve public schools? |publisher=Focus on the Family |url=http://family.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/family.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=796 |accessdate=2008-06-21}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson opposes [[sex education]] curricula that are not [[abstinence]]-only.&lt;ref&gt;James Dobson, Bringing Up Girls, (Carol Stream, Ill. USA: Tyndale House Publishers) 2010 pp. 161-163; James Dobson, Bringing Up Boys, (Carol Stream, Ill. USA: Tyndale House Publishers) 2001, pp. 76, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[People for the American Way]], Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFAW&quot; /&gt; Critics, such as People for the American Way, allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFAW&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=nation06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060814/zirin |title=You Can Keep the Faith |first=Dave |last=Zirin |date=2006-07-28 |work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=2008-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517043711/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060814/zirin |archive-date=2008-05-17 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson supports [[school prayer|student-led prayer]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PFAW&quot; /&gt; and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=lat95&gt;{{cite news |last=Stammer |first=Larry B. |first2=Richard Lee |last2=Colvin |title=Foes Target Amendment on Prayer in Schools; Beliefs: Citing Federal Guidelines, Activists and Some Religious Leaders say a Change in Constitution is Unneeded |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1995-08-31 |page=3}} &quot;We do not support teacher-led, state-mediated school prayer, but we do believe that students have the same religious rights as other people,&quot; said Alan Crippen of &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a major evangelical Christian broadcast and publications ministry founded by psychologist James Dobson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on discipline within the family===
In his book ''Dare to Discipline'', Dobson advocates the [[spanking]] of children up to eight years old when they misbehave, but warns that &quot;[[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] should not be a frequent occurrence&quot; and that &quot;discipline must not be harsh and destructive to the child's spirit.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} He warns against &quot;harsh spanking&quot; because &quot;It is not necessary to beat the child into submission; a little bit of pain goes a long way for a young child. However, the spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the child to cry genuinely.&quot;&lt;ref name=DTD&gt;*{{cite book |last=Dobson |first=James C. |title=Dare to Discipline |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_0553127098 |url-access=registration |date=February 1977 |publisher=Bantam |isbn=0-553-22841-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0553127098/page/7 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson has called disciplining children to be a necessary but unpleasant part of raising children that should only be carried out by qualified parents:

{{quote|Anyone who has ever [[child abuse|abused]] a child—or has ever felt himself losing control during a spanking — should not expose the child to that tragedy. Anyone who has a violent temper that at times becomes unmanageable should not use that approach. Anyone who secretly 'enjoys' the administration of corporal punishment should not be the one to implement it.&lt;ref name=ffcorporal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/?uc_full_date=20041121 |title=Good-Natured Child Needs His Share of Parents' Attention |first=James |last=Dobson |date=2004-11-21 |publisher=Focus on the Family |accessdate=2008-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612122328/http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/?uc_full_date=20041121 |archive-date=2008-06-12 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''The Strong-Willed Child'', Dobson suggests that if authority is portrayed correctly to a child, the child will understand how to interact with other authority figures:

{{quote|By learning to yield to the loving authority ... of his parents, a child learns to submit to other forms of authority which will confront him later in his life—his teachers, school principal, police, neighbors and employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobson |first=James C. |title=The Strong-Willed Child |date=September 1992 |publisher=Living Books |isbn=0-8423-2335-X |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Dobson's opinion, parents must uphold their authority and do so consistently: &quot;When you are defiantly challenged, win decisively.&quot;&lt;ref name=DTD /&gt; In ''The Strong-Willed Child'', Dobson draws an analogy between the defiance of a family pet and that of a small child, and concludes that &quot;just as surely as a dog will occasionally challenge the authority of his leaders, so will a little child—only more so.&quot;&lt;ref name=DTD /&gt; (emphasis in original)

When asked &quot;How long do you think a child should be allowed to cry after being punished? Is there a limit?&quot; Dobson responded:

{{quote|Yes, I believe there should be a limit. As long as the tears represent a genuine release of emotion, they should be permitted to fall. But crying quickly changes from inner sobbing to an expression of protest ... Real crying usually lasts two minutes or less but may continue for five. After that point, the child is merely complaining, and the change can be recognized in the tone and intensity of his voice. I would require him to stop the protest crying, usually by offering him a little more of whatever caused the original tears. In younger children, crying can easily be stopped by getting them interested in something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.troubledwith.com/stellent/groups/public/%5C@fotf_troubledwith/documents/articles/twi_012701.cfm?channel=Parenting%20Children&amp;topic=Discipline&amp;sssct=Questions%20and%20Answers |title=Discipline problems |accessdate=2008-05-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologists John Bartkowski and Christopher Ellison have stated that Dobson's views &quot;diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts&quot; and are not based on any sort of [[Scientific method|empirical testing]], but rather are nothing more than expressions of his religious doctrines of &quot;biblical literalism and 'authority-mindedness.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Divergent Models of Childrearing in Popular Manuals: Conservative Protestants vs. the Mainstream Experts |year=1995 |journal=Sociology of Religion |pages=21–34 |volume=56 |issue=1 |last1=Bartkowski |first1=John P. |last2=Ellison |first2=Christopher G. |doi=10.2307/3712036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on tolerance and diversity===
In the winter of 2004-2005, the [[We Are Family Foundation]] sent American elementary schools approximately 60,000 copies of a free [[DVD]] using popular cartoon characters (especially [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]) to &quot;promote tolerance and diversity.&quot;&lt;ref name=bbcsb&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4190699.stm |title=US right attacks SpongeBob video |work=BBC News |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022539/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4190699.stm |archive-date=2007-03-23 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson contended that &quot;[[Toleration|tolerance]]&quot; and &quot;[[Diversity (politics)|diversity]]&quot; are &quot;buzzwords&quot; that the We Are Family Foundation misused as part of a [[homosexual agenda|&quot;hidden agenda&quot; to promote homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=tolerance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolerance.org/teach/current/event.jsp?p=0&amp;ar=625 |title='We Are Family' DVD Still Available |date=2005-09-06 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114095317/http://www.tolerance.org/teach/current/event.jsp?p=0&amp;ar=625 |archivedate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Zernik noted Dobson asserting: &quot;tolerance and its first cousin, diversity, 'are almost always buzzwords for homosexual advocacy.'&quot;&lt;ref name=nytkz&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1DE153BF933A05752C0A9639C8B63 |title=Buzzwords; Hello, Synergy, Begone, Crisis |date=2005-01-30 |last=Zernike |first=Kate |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109205644/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1DE153BF933A05752C0A9639C8B63 |archive-date=2012-11-09 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated on the Focus on the Family website that &quot;childhood symbols are apparently being hijacked to promote an agenda that involves teaching homosexual [[propaganda]] to children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=131 |title=Religious Right Attacks Tolerance Pledge |date=March 2005 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713225454/http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=131 |archivedate=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered as evidence the association of many leading LGBT rights organizations, including [[GLAAD]], [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network|GLSEN]], [[Human Rights Campaign|HRC]], and [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays|PFLAG]], with the We Are Family Foundation as shown by links which he claims once existed on their website.&lt;ref name= cpost&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/dobson-clarifies-pro-gay-spongebob-video-controversy-20875/ |title=Dobson clarifies Pro-Gay SpongeBob Video Controversy |last=Chang |first=Pauline J. |date=January 28, 2005 |newspaper=The Christian Post |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721232727/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050128/20875.htm |archive-date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The Focus on the Family website stated, &quot;While words like 'diversity' and 'unity' sound harmless — even noble — enough, the reality is they are often used by gay activists as cover for teaching children that homosexuality is the moral and biological equivalent to heterosexuality.&quot; Link no longer works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.family.org/cforum/feature/a0035309.cfm |title=Family Policy Alliance |website=Family Policy Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Dobson believes that God defines marriage as between one man and one woman only and describes this as the central stabilizing institution of society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Dobson believes that any sexual activity outside of such a union—including homosexuality—cannot be approved by God.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Dobson's view, homosexuality results from influences in a child's [[environment and sexual orientation|environment rather than an inborn trait]]. He states that homosexual behavior, specifically &quot;unwanted same-sex attraction&quot;, has been and can be &quot;[[Sexual orientation change efforts|overcome]]&quot; through understanding developmental models for homosexuality and choosing to heal the complex developmental issues which led to same-sex attraction.&lt;ref name=stranger05&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Schmader |title=Jesus Hates You; Christians Rationalize Bigotry at &quot;Love Won Out&quot; |work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=2005-06-30 |volume=14 |issue=42 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson objected to a bill expanding the prohibition of [[sexual orientation]]-based discrimination in the areas of &quot;public accommodation, housing practices, [[family planning]] services and twenty other areas.&quot; He said that, were such a bill passed, public businesses could no longer separate locker rooms and bathrooms by gender, which he claimed would lead to a situation where, &quot;every woman and little girl will have to fear that a [[sexual predator|predator]], [[bisexual]], [[transvestite|cross-dresser]] or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence.&quot;&lt;ref name=dpost08&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_9420864 |title=Anti-bias measure inked: Governor signs bill covering sexual orientation, religious beliefs |last=Ingold |first=John |work=[[The Denver Post]] |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609234946/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_9420864 |archive-date=2008-06-09 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoconnection.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=137923 |title=Controversial ad offends transgendered community |work=ColoradoConnection.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175530/http://www.coloradoconnection.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=137923 |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social influence==
[[File:James Dobson-01.jpg|thumb|Dobson at the Values Voters conference in [[Washington, D.C.]], 2007]]
Although Dobson initially remained somewhat distant from Washington politics, in 1981 he founded the [[Family Research Council]] as a political arm through which &quot;[[Social conservatism|social conservative]] causes&quot; could achieve greater political influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt04&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=David D. |last=Kirkpatrick |title=The 2004 Campaign: Evangelical Christians—Warily, a Religious Leader Lifts His Voice in Politics |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EED9113CF930A25756C0A9629C8B63 |work=The New York Times |date=2004-05-13 |page=A22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], he cast a vote for [[Constitution Party (United States)|U.S. Taxpayers' Party]] Presidential candidate [[Howard Phillips (politics)|Howard Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Phillips (politics)|Phillips, Howard]] (2004-11-08) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2004/nov/08/00011/ Constitutionally Correct Peroutka] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519064035/http://amconmag.com/article/2004/nov/08/00011/ |date=2011-05-19}}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, Dobson led a campaign to block the appointment of [[Arlen Specter]] to head of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] because of Specter's [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-abortion rights]] stance.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnspecter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Conservative leader targets Specter |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/specter.judiciary/index.html |date=2004-11-09 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417183706/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/specter.judiciary/index.html |archivedate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to a question by [[Fox News]] personality [[Alan Colmes]] on whether he wanted the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] to be known as a &quot;big-tent party,&quot; he replied, &quot;I don't want to be in the big tent ...

A May 2005 article by [[Chris Hedges]] in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' described Dobson as &quot;perhaps the most powerful figure in the [[Dominionism|Dominionist]] movement&quot; and &quot;a crucial player in getting out the Christian vote for [[George W.

In November 2004, Dobson was described by the online magazine ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as &quot;America's most influential evangelical leader.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate04&quot; /&gt; The article stated &quot;Forget [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]], who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes ... Dobson is now America's most influential evangelical leader, with a following reportedly greater than that of either Falwell or Robertson at his peak ... Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in [[Ohio]] and [[Florida]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate04&quot;/&gt; Further, &quot;He's already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the [[White House]], Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush &quot;needs to be more aggressive&quot; about pressing the [[Christian right|religious right]]'s pro-life, anti-[[gay rights]] agenda, or it would &quot;pay a price in four years&quot;. Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of [[social conservative]]s for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues: &quot;Does the Republican Party want our votes, no string attached—to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me, I'll call you'—and not to care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that what they want? Is that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be? If it is, I'm gone, and if I go, I will do everything I can to take as many people with me as possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PFAW&quot; /&gt;

However, in 2006, Dobson said that, while &quot;there is disillusionment out there with Republicans&quot; and &quot;that worries me greatly,&quot; he nonetheless suggested voters turn out and vote Republican in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David D. |date=2006-09-25 |title=Christian Conservatives Look to Re-energize Base |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/25/us/politics/christian-conservatives-look-to-reenergize-base.html |access-date=2020-05-27 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;My first inclination was to sit this one out,&quot; but according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dobson then added that &quot;he had changed his mind when he looked at who would become the leaders of [[Congressional committee]]s if the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] took over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt04&quot; /&gt;

Dobson garnered national media attention once again in February 2008 after releasing a statement in the wake of Senator [[John McCain]]'s expected success in the so-called &quot;[[Super Tuesday (2008)|Super Tuesday]]&quot; Republican [[primary election]]s. In his statement, Dobson said: &quot;I cannot, and will not, vote for Senator John McCain, as a matter of conscience,&quot; and indicated that he would refrain from voting altogether if McCain were to become the Republican candidate, echoing other conservative commentators' concerns about the Senator's conservatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;REUTBLOG&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Stoddard |first=Ed |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/02/05/dobson-delivers-blow-to-mccain-candidacy/ |work=Reuters |title=Super Tuesday: Dobson delivers blow to McCain candidacy |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512170414/http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/02/05/dobson-delivers-blow-to-mccain-candidacy/ |archive-date=2008-05-12 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He endorsed [[Mike Huckabee]] for president.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} After McCain selected an anti-abortion candidate, [[Sarah Palin]], as his running mate, Dobson said that he was more enthusiastic in his support for the Republican ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |author2=Ed Pilkington |title=US politics: McCain defends running mate's experience |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/johnmccain.palin |date=2008-09-01 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902224440/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/johnmccain.palin |archive-date=2013-09-02 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Palin's [[Bristol Palin|17-year-old daughter]]'s pregnancy was revealed, Dobson issued a press release commending Palin's stance, saying,

At a [[National Day of Prayer]] event in the U.S. Capitol, Dobson called [[Barack Obama]] &quot;the abortion president.&quot; He said, &quot;President Obama, before he was elected, made it very clear that he wanted to be the abortion president. He didn't make any bones about it. This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he has done that, and in a sense he is the abortion president.&quot; Among others, Rep. [[Janice Hahn]] complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, &quot;Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer.

However, Dobson would later go on to endorse Trump in the [[2016 United States presidential election|general election]] against [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zylstra |first1=Sarah Eekhoff |title=Dobson Explains Why He Called Trump a ‘Baby Christian’ |url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2016/august/james-dobson-explains-why-donald-trump-baby-christian.html |website=News &amp; Reporting |accessdate=27 August 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson has been named by ''[[Christianity Today]]'' as one of the [[Trump Administration]]s top &quot;Evangelical Faith Advisers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Christianity Today’ Identifies Donald Trump’s Evangelical Faith Advisers and Gives Background Information on Each |url=https://blackchristiannews.com/2016/06/brief-explainers-on-each-of-donald-trumps-evangelical-faith-advisers/ |accessdate=27 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, Dobson worked alongside other conservative Evangelicals and Evangelical organizations, including [[Jim Daly (evangelist)|Jim Daly]] and [[Focus on the Family]], to support the [[2020 United States presidential election|reelection]] of President Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rabey |first1=Steve |title=Focus on the Family, James Dobson Family Institute among Colorado Springs ministries pushing to reelect Trump |url=https://gazette.com/premium/focus-on-the-family-james-dobson-family-institute-among-colorado-springs-ministries-pushing-to-reelect/article_c7cab60e-0395-11eb-ba20-b3dcb16dd2be.html |website=The Gazette |accessdate=5 October 2020 |date=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He echoed his support of the President throughout the [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeachment proceedings]] earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. James Dobson responds to ‘Christianity Today’s’ call for Trump removal |url=https://www.al.com/news/2019/12/dr-james-dobson-responds-to-christianity-todays-call-for-trump-removal.html|accessdate=5 October 2020 |date=23 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecumenical relations==
Dobson and [[Charles Colson]] were two participants in a 2000 conference at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on the global economy's impact on families.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} During the conference, the two [[Protestant]]s met with [[Pope John Paul II]]. Dobson later told [[Catholic News Service]] that though he has theological differences with [[Roman Catholicism]], &quot;when it comes to the family, there is far more agreement than disagreement, and with regard to moral issues from abortion to premarital sex, safe-sex ideology and homosexuality, I find more in common with Catholics than with some of my evangelical brothers and sisters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/decemberweb-only/22.0a.html |title=James Dobson Charles Colson Head to Vatican Meet with Pope |access-date=2009-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907221907/http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/decemberweb-only/22.0a.html |archive-date=2009-09-07 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Dobson signed an ecumenical statement known as the ''[[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]]'' calling on evangelicals, Catholics and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901171332/http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers |date=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

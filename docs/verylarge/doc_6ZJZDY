The sugar industry in the EU came under bureaucratic pressure in 2006 and ultimately resulted in the loss of 20,000 jobs, although many factories, as detailed in a later 2010 EU audit, were found to have been mistakenly shut down, as they were profitable without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1110/greencore-business.html |title=Greencore sugar plant closure unnecessary? - RTÉ News |journal=RTÉ.ie |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Europe, and Eastern Europe did not produce enough sugar from sugar beets to meet overall demand for sugar in 2010–2011, and were net importers of sugar.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

===Reception===
After they are harvested, beets are typically transported to a factory. In the UK, beets are transported by a hauler, or by a tractor and a trailer by local farmers. Railways and boats are no longer used. Some beets were carried by rail in the [[Republic of Ireland]], until the complete shutdown of [[Irish Sugar]] beet production in 2006.

Each load is weighed and sampled before it gets tipped onto the reception area, typically a flat concrete pad, where it is moved into large heaps. The beet sample is checked for
* soil tare – the amount of nonbeet delivered
* crown tare – the amount of low-sugar beet delivered
* sugar content ([[Polarimetry|&quot;pol&quot;]]) - amount of sucrose in the crop
* nitrogen content – for recommending future fertilizer use to the farmer.

From these elements, the actual sugar content of the load is calculated and the grower's payment determined.

The beet is moved from the heaps into a central channel or gulley, where it is washed towards the processing plant.

===Diffusion===
[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|Dried sugar beet cossettes]]
After reception at the processing plant, the beet roots are washed, mechanically sliced into thin strips called '''cossettes''', and passed to a machine called a diffuser to extract the sugar content into a water solution, a process known as [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]].

Diffusers are long vessels of many metres in which the beet slices go in one direction while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either be caused by a rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and cossettes move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' ''([[Raffinerie Tirlemontoise]]'', manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (''De Danske Sukkerfabrikker''), or vertical screw &quot;Tower&quot;. Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to {{convert|17,000|t|sigfig=3|sp=us|lk=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=bmade/&gt; A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These [[countercurrent exchange]] methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called '''raw juice'''. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.

The used cossettes, or '''pulp''', exit the diffuser at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using [[screw press]]es, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture. This recovers additional sucrose in the liquid pressed out of the pulp, and reduces the energy needed to dry the pulp. The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the liquid pressed out of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process. The final byproduct, [[vinasse]], is used as fertilizer or growth substrate for yeast cultures.

During diffusion, a portion of the sucrose breaks down into [[invert sugar]]s. These can undergo further breakdown into acids. These breakdown products are not only losses of sucrose, but also have knock-on effects reducing the final output of processed sugar from the factory. To limit (thermophilic) bacterial action, the feed water may be dosed with [[formaldehyde]] and control of the feed water [[pH]] is also practised. Attempts at operating diffusion under alkaline conditions have been made, but the process has proven problematic. The improved sucrose extraction in the diffuser is offset by processing problems in the next stages.

===Carbonatation===
[[File:Suikerbietenrooier zesrijige bunker (Sugarbeet harvester).jpg|thumb|left|A beet harvester]]
[[Carbonatation]] is a procedure which removes impurities from raw juice before it undergoes crystallization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t08wJ9MRSXwC&amp;q=Carbonatation+is+a+procedure+which+removes+impurities+from+raw+sugar+beet+juice+before+it+undergoes+crystallization&amp;pg=PA53|title=Chemical Process Technology and Simulation|last=KOYIKKAL|first=SRIKUMAR|date=2013-04-08|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120347090|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the juice is mixed with hot [[milk of lime]] (a suspension of [[calcium hydroxide]] in water). This treatment [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] a number of impurities, including multivalent [[anion]]s such as [[sulfate]], [[phosphate]], [[citrate]] and [[oxalate]], which precipitate as their calcium salts and large organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[saponin]]s and [[pectin]]s, which aggregate in the presence of multivalent [[cation]]s. In addition, the alkaline conditions convert the simple sugars, [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], along with the amino acid [[glutamine]], to chemically stable [[carboxylic acid]]s. Left untreated, these sugars and amines would eventually frustrate crystallization of the sucrose.

Next, [[carbon dioxide]] is bubbled through the alkaline sugar solution, precipitating the lime as [[calcium carbonate]] ([[chalk]]). The chalk particles entrap some impurities and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] others. A recycling process builds up the size of chalk particles and a natural [[flocculation]] occurs where the heavy particles settle out in tanks (clarifiers). A final addition of more carbon dioxide precipitates more calcium from solution; this is filtered off, leaving a cleaner, golden light-brown sugar solution called '''thin juice'''.

Before entering the next stage, the thin juice may receive [[soda ash]] to modify the pH and sulphitation with a [[sulfur]]-based compound to reduce colour formation due to decomposition of monosaccharides under heat.

===Evaporation===
[[File:Hollogne sur-geer -Sucrerie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sugar beet farm in Belgium: Beyond the field is the sugar factory.]]
[[File:BritishSugarAlscottCB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar refinery]] in [[Allscott]] in [[Shropshire]], England]]
The thin juice is concentrated by [[multiple-effect evaporation]] to make a '''thick juice''', roughly 60% sucrose by weight and similar in appearance to [[Maple syrup|pancake syrup]]. Thick juice can be stored in tanks for later processing, reducing the load on the crystallization plant.

===Crystallization===
Thick juice is fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is dissolved into it, and the resulting syrup is called [[mother liquor]]. The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a ''massecuite'', from &quot;cooked mass&quot; in [[French language|French]]. The massecuite is passed to a [[centrifuge]], where the High Green syrup is removed from the massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predetermined time, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge through a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals. The machine then slows down and a plough-shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto a conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.

The high green syrup is fed to a raw sugar vacuum pan from which a second batch of sugar is produced. This sugar (&quot;raw&quot;) is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the sugar dissolved again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled for a long time in AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallizes. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as &quot;AP sugar&quot;) that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is [[molasses]], which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed, sold in bulk tankers, fermented to alcohol, or further processed.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverwedge&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Silver Wedge: The Sugar Beet Industry in Fort Collins |author=Eric Twitty |work=SWCA Environmental Consultants |date=August 2003 |access-date=9 August 2020 |url= https://www.fcgov.com/parkplanning/files/silver-wedge_the-sugar-beet-industry-in-fort-collins_a-historical-context.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molasses recovery===
Since the molasses still contained sugar, it was advantageous to recover it. The Steffen Process was used to recover some, so advanced factories had a &quot;Steffen house&quot; next to the plant. During World War I, when imported [[potash]] from European sources was unavailable in the United States, &quot;Steffen's wastewater&quot; provided a good source, leading to a profitable income stream for a factory. The need disappeared immediately after the war. In the 1950s, [[industrial fermentation]] advanced to produce [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), previously produced in Japan by the expensive [[racemization]] process. Beet sugar molasses, with a [[corynebacterium]] (especially [[corynebacterium glutamicum]]) and combined with [[penicillin]] or a [[surfactant]] to block [[biotin]], produced MSG as a result, which effectively produced large profits from what was formerly waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverwedge&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tasty&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarah E.

;Sugar beet syrup
[[File:Molasses.JPG|thumb|left|Sugar beet molasses in France, used as cattle [[fodder]] supplement]]
An unrefined sugary syrup can be produced directly from sugar beet. This thick, dark syrup is produced by cooking shredded sugar beet for several hours, then pressing the resulting mash and concentrating the juice produced until it has a consistency similar to that of [[honey]]. No other ingredients are used. In Germany, particularly the [[Rhineland]] area, this sugar beet syrup (called ''Zuckerrüben-Sirup'' or ''Zapp'' in German) is used as a spread for sandwiches, as well as for sweetening sauces, cakes and desserts.

Commercially, if the syrup has a [[Dextrose equivalent|dextrose equivalency (DE)]] above 30, the product has to be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and converted to a high-fructose syrup, much like [[high-fructose corn syrup]], or isoglucose syrup in the EU.

Many road authorities in North America use desugared beet molasses as de-icing or anti-icing products in winter control operations. The molasses can be used directly,&lt;ref name=&quot;sugar.ca&quot;/&gt; combined with liquid chlorides and applied to road surfaces, or used to treat the salt spread on roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAS Article&quot;/&gt; Molasses can be more advantageous than road salt alone because it reduces corrosion and lowers the freezing point of the salt-brine mix, so the de-icers remain effective at lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;sugar.ca&quot;/&gt; Adding the liquid to rock salt also reduces the bounce and scatter of the rock salt, keeping it where it is needed, and reduces the activation time of the salt to begin the melting process.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAS Article&quot;/&gt;

;Betaine
[[Betaine]] can be isolated from the byproducts of sugar beet processing. Production is chiefly through [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] separation, using techniques such as the &quot;simulated moving bed&quot;.

;Alternative fuel
[[BP]] and [[Associated British Foods]] plan to use agricultural surpluses of sugar beet to produce [[biobutanol]] in [[East Anglia]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The feedstock-to-yield ratio for sugarbeet is 56:9. Therefore, it takes 6.22&amp;nbsp;kg of sugar beet to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kg of ethanol (approximately 1.27 l at room temperature).

==Agriculture==
[[File:Dammanbau Zuckerruebe.svg|thumb|Sugar beet farming using dam culture method. Used in Russia, Germany, France, Ukraine, Turkey, China, Poland, and sometimes Egypt]]
Sugar beets are an important part of a [[crop rotation]] cycle.

Sugar beet plants are susceptible to ''[[Beet necrotic yellow vein virus|Rhizomania]]'' (&quot;root madness&quot;), which turns the bulbous tap root into many small roots, making the crop economically unprocessable. Strict controls are enforced in European countries to prevent the spread, but it is already present in some areas. It is also susceptible to both the [[beet leaf curl virus]], which causes crinkling and stunting of the leaves and [[Beet yellows virus|beet yellows virus]].

Continual research looks for varieties with resistance, as well as increased sugar yield. Sugar beet breeding research in the United States is most prominently conducted at various [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Agricultural Research Stations, including one in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], headed by Linda Hanson and Leonard Panella; one in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], headed by John Wieland; and one at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], headed by J. Mitchell McGrath.

* ''[[Mangelwurzel]]'' or fodder beet.

===Genetic modification===
{{Main|Genetically modified sugar beet}}
In the United States, genetically modified sugar beets, engineered for resistance to [[glyphosate]], a [[herbicide]] marketed as Roundup, were developed by [[Monsanto]] as a [[genetically modified crop]]. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ([[USDA]]-[[APHIS]]) deregulated glyphosate-resistant sugar beets after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely to become a plant pest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roundup Ready Sugarbeets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=APHIS-history/&gt; Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada. Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional sugar beets.&lt;ref name=AppealDecision2011 /&gt; After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were extensively adopted in the United States. About 95% of sugar beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.&lt;ref name=James2011/&gt;

Weeds may be chemically controlled using [[glyphosate]] without harming the crop. After planting sugar beet seed, weeds emerge in fields and growers apply glyphosate to control them. Glyphosate is commonly used in field crops because it controls a broad spectrum of weed species&lt;ref name=michsug/&gt; and has a low [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name=usda3/&gt; A study from the UK&lt;ref name=nih/&gt; suggests yields of genetically modified beet were greater than conventional, while another from the North Dakota State University extension service found lower yields.&lt;ref name=nlpw/&gt; The introduction of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets may contribute to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds, so Monsanto has developed a program to encourage growers to use different herbicide modes of action to control their weeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Releases&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, the [[Center for Food Safety]], the [[Sierra Club]], the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed a lawsuit against [[USDA]]-[[APHIS]] regarding their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in 2005. The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets' ability to potentially [[cross-pollinate]] with conventional sugar beets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roundup Ready Sugar Beet Case: Timeline&quot;/&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Jeffrey White|Jeffrey S. White]], [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|US District Court for the Northern District of California]], revoked the deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets and declared it unlawful for growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roundup Ready Sugar Beet Case: Timeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=usda5/&gt; Believing a sugar shortage would occur USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA Prepares Draft Environmental Assessment on Regulatory Options for Roundup Ready Sugar Beets&quot;/&gt; In 2011, a federal appeals court for the Northern district of California in San Francisco overturned the ruling.&lt;ref name=AppealDecision2011/&gt; In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready sugar beets.&lt;ref name=usda6/&gt;

'''Laurent-Désiré Kabila''' (French pronunciation: lo.ʁɑ̃ de.zi.ʁe ka.bi.la) (November 27, 1939 – January 16, 2001), or simply '''Laurent Kabila''' (&lt;small&gt;[[American English|US]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio|En-us-Laurent Kabila from Congo-Kinshasa pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|pronunciation}}), was a [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[revolutionary]] and politician who served as the third [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from May 17, 1997, when he overthrew [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], until his assassination on January 16, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/indepthmain.aspx?InDepthId=57&amp;ReportId=72398|title=IRIN – In Depth Reports|work=IRIN|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded eight days later by his 29-year-old son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;  John C. Fredriksen, ed. ''Biographical Dictionary of Modern World Leaders'' (2003) pp 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Kabila was born to the [[Luba people]] in Baudouinville, [[Katanga Province]], (now [[Moba, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Moba]], [[Tanganyika Province]]) in the [[Belgian Congo]]. His father was a Luba and his mother was a [[Lunda people|Lunda]]; his father's ethnicity was defining in the patriarchal kinship system. It is claimed that he studied abroad (political philosophy in [[Paris]], got a PhD in [[Tashkent]], in [[Belgrade]] and at last in [[Dar es Salaam]]), but no proof has been found or provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/afrique/l-obscur-m-kabila_493335.html |title=L'obscur M. Kabila |work=[[L'Express]] |date=June 25, 1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activities ==
=== Congo crisis ===
Shortly after the Congo achieved independence in 1960, [[State of Katanga|Katanga seceded]] under the leadership of [[Moïse Tshombe]]. Kabila organised the [[Baluba]] in an anti-secessionist rebellion in [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]]. In September 1962 a new province, [[Tanganyika Province|North Katanga]], was established. He became a member of the provincial assembly{{sfn|Colvin|1968|p=169}} and served as chief of cabinet for Minister of Information Ferdinand Tumba.&lt;ref name=Dunn54&gt;
Kevin C. Dunn, &quot;A Survival Guide to Kinshasa: Lessons of the Father, Passed Down to the Son&quot; in John F. Clark, ed., ''The African Stakes of the Congo War'', Palgrave MacMillan: New York, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4039-6723-7}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1963 he and other young members of the assembly were forced to resign, facing allegations of communist sympathies.{{sfn|Colvin|1968|p=169}}

Kabila established himself as a supporter of hard-line Lumumbist [[Prosper Mwamba Ilunga]]. When the Lumumbists formed the [[Conseil National de Libération]], he was sent{{by whom|date=November 2013}} to eastern Congo to help organize a revolution, in particular in the [[Kivu]] and North Katanga provinces. This revolution was part of the larger [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebellions]] happening in the provinces at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Congo : the epic history of a people|last=Van Reybrouck, David|others=Garrett, Sam|year=2014|isbn=9780007562916|location=London|pages=322|oclc=875627937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Kabila set up a cross-border rebel operation from [[Kigoma]], Tanzania, across [[Lake Tanganyika]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn54&quot;/&gt;

=== Che Guevara ===
[[Che Guevara]] assisted Kabila for a short time in 1965. Guevara had appeared in the Congo with approximately 100 men who planned to bring about a Cuban-style revolution. Guevara judged Kabila (then 26) as &quot;not the man of the hour&quot; he had alluded to, being too distracted. This, in Guevara's opinion, accounted for Kabila showing up days late at times to provide supplies, aid, or backup to Guevara's men. The lack of cooperation between Kabila and Guevara contributed to the suppression of the revolt that same year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/2264.asp |title=Mfi Hebdo |publisher=Rfi.fr |date=July 6, 2009 |access-date=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Guevara's view, of all of the people he met during his campaign in Congo, only Kabila had &quot;genuine qualities of a mass leader&quot;; but Guevara castigated Kabila for a lack of &quot;revolutionary seriousness&quot;&lt;!-- (cf page 244 Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara The African Dream - Publisher: Harvill Panther) --&gt;. After the failure of the rebellion, Kabila turned to smuggling gold and timber on Lake Tanganyika. He also ran a bar and brothel in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/481974|title=Laurent Kabila|work=The Economist|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxist mini-state (1967–1988) ===
In 1967, Kabila and his remnant of supporters moved their operation into the mountainous [[Fizi Territory|Fizi – Baraka]] area of [[South Kivu]] in the Congo, and founded the [[:fr:Parti de la r%C3%A9volution du peuple|People's Revolutionary Party]] (PRP). With the support of the People's Republic of China, the PRP created a secessionist [[Marxism|Marxist]] state in [[South Kivu]] province, west of [[Lake Tanganyika]].&lt;ref&gt;  John C. Fredriksen, ed. ''Biographical Dictionary of Modern World Leaders'' (2003) pp 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRP state came to an end in 1988 and Kabila disappeared and was widely believed to be dead. While in [[Kampala]], Kabila reportedly met [[Yoweri Museveni]], the future [[president of Uganda]]. Museveni and former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] later introduced Kabila to [[Paul Kagame]], who would become [[president of Rwanda]]. These personal contacts became vital in mid-1990s, when Uganda and Rwanda sought a Congolese face for their intervention in [[Zaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== First Congo War ==
Kabila returned in October 1996, leading ethnic [[Tutsi]]s from [[South Kivu]] against [[Hutu]] forces, marking the beginning of the [[First Congo War]]. With support from [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]], Kabila pushed his forces into a full-scale rebellion against Mobutu as the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire]] (ADFL).

By mid-1997, the ADFL had almost completely overrun the country and the remains of Mobutu's army.  Only the country's decrepit infrastructure slowed Kabila's forces down; in many areas, the only means of transit were irregularly used dirt paths.&lt;ref name=Dickovick&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J. Tyler |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-61048-881-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/africa20120000dick }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following failed peace talks held on board of the South African ship [[SAS Outeniqua|SAS ''Outeniqua'']], Mobutu fled into exile on 16 May.

The next day, from his base in [[Lubumbashi]], Kabila proclaimed himself [[List of Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]]. Kabila suspended the Constitution, and changed the name of the country from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the country's official name from 1964 to 1971. He made his grand entrance into Kinshasa on 20 May and was sworn in on 31 May, officially commencing his term as president.

== Presidency (1997–2001) ==
[[Image:Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.svg (1997-2003).svg|thumb|The [[Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] used by Kabila.]]

Kabila had been a committed Marxist, but his policies at this point were [[Social democracy|social democratic]]. He declared that elections would not be held for two years, since it would take him at least that long to restore order. While some in the West hailed Kabila as representing a &quot;new breed&quot; of African leadership, critics charged that Kabila's policies differed little from his predecessor's, being characterised by authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses.  As early as late 1997, Kabila was being denounced as &quot;another Mobutu&quot;. Kabila was also accused trying to set up a [[personality cult]]. Mobutu's former minister of information, Dominique Sakombi Inongo, was retained by Kabila; he branded Kabila as &quot;the Mzee,&quot; and created posters reading &quot;Here is the man we needed&quot; ({{lang-fr|Voici l'homme que nous avions besoin}}) appeared all over the country.
&lt;ref name=Edgerton&gt;{{Cite book |last=Edgerton |first=Robert |date=18 December 2002 |title=The Troubled Heart of Africa: A History of the Congo |url=https://archive.org/details/troubledheartofa00edge |url-access=registration |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=0-312-30486-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, Kabila's former allies in Uganda and Rwanda had turned against him and backed a new rebellion of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD), the [[Second Congo War]]. Kabila found new allies in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[Zimbabwe]], and managed to hold on in the south and west of the country and by July 1999, peace talks led to the withdrawal of most foreign forces.

==Assassination==
[[File:Joseph kabila.jpg|thumb|right|Laurent-Désiré Kabila's son and successor, [[Joseph Kabila]]]]
Kabila was shot and killed in his office on 16 January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title=Revealed: how Africa's dictator died at the hands of his boy soldiers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/11/theobserver |website=The Guardian |access-date=30 December 2018 |date=11 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DRC's authorities managed to keep power, despite Kabila's assassination. The exact circumstances are still disputed. Kabila reportedly died on the spot, according to DRC's then health minister [[Leonard Mashako Mamba]], who was in the next door office when Kabila was shot and arrived immediately after the assassination. The government claimed that Kabila was still alive, however, when he was flown to a hospital in [[Zimbabwe]] after he was shot so that DRC authorities could organize the tense succession.&lt;ref&gt; Fredriksen, ed. ''Biographical Dictionary of Modern World Leaders'' (2003) pp 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congolese government announced that he had died of his wounds on 18 January. One week later, his body was returned to Congo for a [[state funeral]] and his son, [[Joseph Kabila]], became president ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/27/world/glimpse-of-new-president-as-joseph-kabila-takes-oath-in-congo.html|title=Glimpse of New President as Joseph Kabila Takes Oath in Congo|last=Onishi|first=Norimitsu|date=2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, DRC officials were accomplishing the &quot;verbal testimony&quot; of the deceased President. Then Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo and Kabila's aide-de-camp Eddy Kapend reported that Kabila had told them that his son Joseph, then number two of the army, should take over, if he were to die in office.

The investigation into Kabila's assassination led to 135 people – including four children – being tried before a special [[military tribunal]]. The alleged ringleader, Colonel Eddy Kapend (one of Kabila's cousins), and 25 others were sentenced to death in January 2003, but not executed. Of the other defendants 64 were jailed, with sentences from six months to life, and 45 were exonerated. Some individuals were also accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow his son. Among them was Kabila's special advisor [[Emmanuel Dungia]], former ambassador to South Africa. Many people believe the trial was flawed and the convicted defendants innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/2011/10/20111027131838717148.html|title=Murder in Kinshasa|author=Special programme|website=Aljazeera.com|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20100125-focus-rdc-justice-assassinat-republique-democratique-du-congo-kabila |title=Zone d'ombre autour d'un assassinat |language=fr |last1=Zajtman |first1=Arnaud |last2=Rabaud |first2=Marlène |access-date=May 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705184514/http://www.france24.com/fr/20100125-focus-rdc-justice-assassinat-republique-democratique-du-congo-kabila |archive-date=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

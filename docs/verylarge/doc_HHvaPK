'''Leonard Bernstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|n|s|t|aɪ|n}} {{respell|BURN|styne}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karlin|first=Fred|title=Listening to Movies 8|year=1994|publisher=Schirmer|location=New York|page=264}} Bernstein's pronunciation of his own name as he introduces his ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; August 25, 1918&amp;nbsp;– October 14, 1990) was an American composer, conductor, pianist, music educator, author, and lifelong humanitarian. He was one of the most significant American cultural personalities of the 20th century. According to music critic [[Donal Henahan]], he was &quot;one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history&quot;.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

As a composer he wrote in many styles, including symphonic and orchestral music, ballet, film and theatre music, choral works, opera, chamber music and works for the piano. His best-known work is the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[West Side Story]]'', which continues to be regularly performed worldwide, and was made into an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[West Side Story (1961 film)|feature film]]. His works include three symphonies, ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'', ''[[Serenade after Plato's &quot;Symposium&quot;]]'', the original score for the film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', and theater works including ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'', and his ''[[Mass (Bernstein)|MASS]]''.

Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead an American orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1990-10-15|title=Leonard Bernstein Dies; Conductor, Composer : Music: Renaissance man of his art was 72.

Bernstein was the first conductor to share and explore music on television with a mass audience. Through dozens of national and international broadcasts, including the [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[Young People's Concerts|''Young People's Concerts'' with the New York Philharmonic]], he made even the most rigorous elements of classical music an adventure in which everyone could join. Through his educational efforts, including several books and the creation of two major international music festivals, he influenced several generations of young musicians.

A lifelong humanitarian, Bernstein worked in support of [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-03-24|title=March 24, 1965: &quot;The Night the 'Stars' Came Out in Alabama&quot;|url=https://bernstein.classical.org/features/march-24-1965-night-stars-came-alabama/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=Classical.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; protested the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How Bernstein Came to 'MASS'|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/bernstein-100/history/how-bernstein-came-to-mass.html|access-date=2020-07-15|website=www.brandeis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocated for nuclear disarmament; raised money for HIV/AIDS research and awareness; and engaged in multiple international initiatives for human rights and world peace.

Born '''Louis Bernstein''' in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], he was the son of [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] parents, Jennie (née Resnick) and Samuel Joseph Bernstein, both of whom immigrated to the United States from [[Rovno]] (now Ukraine).&lt;ref name=&quot;times10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dougary|first=Ginny|title=Leonard Bernstein: 'charismatic, pompous&amp;nbsp;– and a great father'|work=The Times|location=UK|date=March 13, 2010|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/leonard-bernstein-charismatic-pompous-and-a-great-father-7pn3lvf6kkg|accessdate=March 17, 2020}} {{subscription|date=March 2020}}; also [http://www.ginnydougary.co.uk/leonard-bernstein-%E2%80%98charismatic-pompous-and-a-great-father/ here] at ginnydougary.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes90&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Leonard Bernstein Dies; Conductor, Composer Music: Renaissance man of his art was 72.

He legally changed his name to Leonard when he was eighteen, shortly after his grandmother's death.{{sfn|Peyser|1987|pages=22–24}} To his friends and many others he was simply known as &quot;Lenny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edwina Pitman|date=12 August 2018|title='Lenny changed my life': why Bernstein still inspires|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/12/leonard-bernstein-composer-legacy-inspiration-documentary|access-date=10 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was the owner of The Samuel Bernstein Hair and Beauty Supply Company. It held the New England franchise for the Frederick's Permanent Wave Machine, whose immense popularity helped Sam get his family through [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Corinna. Harvard Bernstein Festival Program Book.https://music.fas.harvard.edu/Oja-ShelemayBernsteinJSAM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Leonard's early youth, his only exposure to music was the household radio and music on Friday nights at Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Roxbury, MA. When Leonard was ten years old, Samuel's sister Clara deposited her upright piano at her brother's house.

Bernstein began teaching himself piano and music theory and was soon clamoring for lessons. He had a variety of piano teachers in his youth, including Helen Coates, who later became his secretary.

In the summers, the Bernstein family would go to their vacation home in [[Sharon, Massachusetts]], where young Leonard conscripted all the neighborhood children to put on shows ranging from Bizet's ''Carmen'' to Gilbert and Sullivan's ''The Pirates of Penzance''. 

He would often play entire operas or [[Beethoven symphonies]] with his younger sister Shirley.

Leonard's youngest sibling Burton was born in 1932, thirteen years after his older brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=29 August 2017|title=Burton Bernstein Obituary|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=burton-bernstein&amp;pid=186506798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large span in age, the three siblings remained close their entire lives.

Sam was initially opposed to young Leonard's interest in music and attempted to discourage his son's interest by refusing to pay for his piano lessons. Leonard then took to giving lessons to young people in his neighborhood. One of his students, [[Sid Ramin]], became Bernstein's most frequent orchestrator and lifelong beloved friend.

Sam took his son to orchestral concerts in his teenage years and eventually supported his music education. In May 1932, Leonard attended his first orchestral concert with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arthur Fiedler]]''.'' Bernstein recalled, “To me, in those days, the Pops was heaven itself … I thought … it was the supreme achievement of the human race.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Penny|date=26 April 2018|title=Boston Pops to celebrate the magic of Leonard Bernstein|work=Jewish Journal|url=https://jewishjournal.org/2018/04/26/boston-pops-to-celebrate-the-magic-of-leonard-bernstein/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this concert that Bernstein first heard Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', which made a tremendous impression on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Simeone|first=Nigel|title=The Leonard Bernstein Letters|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0300186543}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another strong musical influence was [[George Gershwin]]. Bernstein was a counselor at a summer camp when news came over the radio of Gershwin's death. In the mess hall, a shaken Bernstein demanded a moment of silence, and then played Gershwin's second [[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|''Prelude'']] as a memorial.

On March 30, 1932, Bernstein played Brahms's [[Rhapsodies, Op. 79 (Brahms)|''Rhapsody in G Minor'']] at his first public piano performance in Susan Williams's studio recital at the [[New England Conservatory of Music|New England Conservatory]]. Two years later, he made his solo debut with orchestra in [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Grieg's ''Piano Concerto in A Minor'']] with the Boston Public School Orchestra. 

=== 1935–1940: College years ===
A product of public education, Bernstein attended the Garrison Grammar School and [[Boston Latin School]].{{sfn|Peyser|1987|p=34}} 

After graduation from [[Boston Latin School]] in 1935, Bernstein attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied music with, among others, [[Edward Burlingame Hill]] and [[Walter Piston]]. Although he majored in music with a final year thesis (1939) entitled &quot;The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music&quot; (reproduced in his book ''Findings''), one of Bernstein's intellectual influences at Harvard was the [[aesthetics]] Professor [[David Prall]], whose multidisciplinary outlook on the arts Bernstein shared for the rest of his life.

One of his friends at Harvard was philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], with whom he played [[piano four hands]]. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production Davidson mounted of [[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' in the original Greek. Bernstein reused some of this music in the ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]''.

After completing his studies at Harvard in 1939 (graduating with a [[B.A.]] ''[[cum laude]]''), he enrolled at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]]. At Curtis, Bernstein studied conducting with [[Fritz Reiner]] (who anecdotally is said to have given Bernstein the only &quot;A&quot; grade he ever awarded), piano with [[Isabelle Vengerova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peyser|1987|pp=38–39}} (Bernstein complained later that she taught him an incorrect piano technique).&lt;/ref&gt; orchestration with [[Randall Thompson]], counterpoint with [[Richard Stöhr]], and score reading with Renée Longy Miquelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Leonard Bernstein chronology|url=https://www.leonardbernstein.com/lifeswork/timeline/timeline01.asp|website=www.leonardbernstein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early musical influences ====
During his time at Harvard he was briefly an accompanist for the [[Harvard Glee Club]].{{sfn|Peyser|1987|pp=39–40}} Bernstein also mounted a student production of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', directing its action from the piano as the composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] had done at the premiere. Blitzstein, who heard about the production, subsequently became a friend and influence (both musically and politically) on Bernstein.

Bernstein also met the conductor [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] at the time. Although he never taught Bernstein, Mitropoulos's charisma and power as a musician were a major influence on Bernstein's eventual decision to take up conducting.

Bernstein met composer [[Aaron Copland]] on his birthday in 1938, first at a concert and then at a party afterwards. At the party Bernstein played Copland's [[Piano Variations (Copland)|Piano Variations]], a work Bernstein loved. Although he was not formally Copland's student, Bernstein would regularly seek advice from Copland in the following years about his own compositions and would often cite him as &quot;his only real composition teacher&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;teachers&quot;&gt;See for instance Bernstein's 1980 TV Documentary, ''Teachers and Teaching'' available on a Deutsche Grammophon DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Bernstein began his study at the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s summer institute, [[Tanglewood]], in the conducting class of the orchestra's conductor, [[Serge Koussevitzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tanglewood {{!}} Educator {{!}} About {{!}} Leonard Bernstein|url=https://leonardbernstein.com/about/educator/tanglewood|access-date=2020-07-01|website=leonardbernstein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other students in the class included [[Lukas Foss]], who also became a lifelong friend. Koussevitzky became a sort of father figure to him and influenced Bernstein's emotional way of interpreting music. Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's Tanglewood conducting assistant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Bernstein|url=http://www.leonardbernstein.com/about.php|accessdate=January 15, 2007|publisher=Leonard Bernstein official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated his [[Symphony No. 2 (Bernstein)|Symphony No. 2, ''The Age of Anxiety'']], to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonard Bernstein&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url=http://www.sonyclassical.com/artists/bernstein/bio.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20051013033618/http://www.sonyclassical.com/artists/bernstein/bio.html|archive-date=October 13, 2005|accessdate=January 15, 2007|publisher=Sony Classical|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
=== The 1940s ===
[[File:Leonard Bernstein and Benny Goodman in rehearsal.jpg|thumb|Lenny Bernstein and [[Benny Goodman]] in rehearsal, ca. 1940–1949]]
After he left Curtis, Bernstein moved to New York City. He shared an apartment with his friend [[Adolph Green]], and often accompanied Green, [[Betty Comden]], and [[Judy Holliday]] in a comedy troupe called The Revuers who performed in [[Greenwich Village]]. He taught piano to local children he thought had talent, and took jobs with a music publisher, transcribing music or producing arrangements under the pseudonym Lenny Amber (Bernstein means &quot;[[Amber]]&quot; in German).{{sfn|Burton|1994|page=108}}

==== New York Philharmonic conducting debut ====
On November 14, 1943, having recently been appointed assistant conductor to [[Artur Rodziński]] of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein made his major conducting debut at short notice—and without any rehearsal—after guest conductor [[Bruno Walter]] came down with the flu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/71509682-511b-4ba3-8df5-e6f37af19d3d Program and recording] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917065039/http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/71509682-511b-4ba3-8df5-e6f37af19d3d |date=September 17, 2016 }} (except Wagner's Prelude to ''Die Meistersinger''), New York Philharmonic Digital Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The program included works by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Miklós Rózsa]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' with cello soloist [[Joseph Schuster (cellist)|Joseph Schuster]]. Before the concert Bernstein briefly spoke to Walter, who discussed particular difficulties in the works he was to perform. The next day, ''[[The New York Times]]'' carried the story on its front page and remarked in an editorial, &quot;It's a good American success story. The warm, friendly triumph of it filled [[Carnegie Hall]] and spread far over the air waves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MAR 6250&quot;&gt;{{citation |author=Deems Taylor |title=Pathétique |publisher=Music-Appreciation Records |date=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Hamilton, &quot;Dorle Jarmel Soria&quot;, ''Opera News'' 67 (October 2002), p. 84. The &quot;event&quot; was due in part to the efforts of [[Dorle Soria]] who had been on the staff of the New York Philharmonic since the late 1920s.&lt;/ref&gt; He became instantly famous because the concert was nationally broadcast on [[CBS Radio]] and began appearing as a guest conductor with many orchestras in the United States and Canada.&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
From 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the Music Director of the New York City Symphony, which had been founded the previous year by the conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]]. The orchestra (with support from [[Fiorello La Guardia|Mayor Fiorello La Guardia]]) had modern programs and affordable tickets.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, Matt (August 25, 2016).

In 1945, Bernstein discussed the possibility of acting in a film with [[Greta Garbo]]—playing [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] opposite her starring role as the composer's patron [[Nadezhda von Meck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rockwell |first=John |author-link=John Rockwell |title=Maestro – ''The Leonard Bernstein Letters'' (review) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/books/review/the-leonard-bernstein-letters.html |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, he conducted opera professionally for the first time at Tanglewood with the American premiere of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Peter Grimes]]'', which was commissioned by Koussevitzky. That same year, [[Arturo Toscanini]] invited Bernstein to guest conduct two concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], one of which also featured Bernstein as soloist in [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s [[Piano Concerto in G (Ravel)|Piano Concerto in G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBD_ujAW520C&amp;pg=PA85|title=Arturo Toscanini: the NBC years|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57467-069-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early compositions ====
In addition to becoming known as a conductor, Bernstein also emerged as a composer in the same period. In January 1944, he conducted the premiere of his ''[[Symphony No. 1 (Bernstein)|Jeremiah Symphony]]'' in Pittsburgh with the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]]. His score to the ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]] commissioned by [[American Ballet Theatre]] in New York in April 1944, which was later developed into the musical ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' with lyrics by Comden and Green that opened on Broadway in December 1944.

==== European conducting firsts ====
[[File:Leonard Bernstein NYWTS 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bernstein conducting the New York City Symphony (1945)]]
In 1946, he made his overseas debut with the [[Czech Philharmonic]] in Prague. He also recorded Ravel's Piano Concerto in G as soloist and conductor with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]. On July 4, 1946, Bernstein conducted the European premiere of ''Fancy Free'' with the Ballet Theatre at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London. 

==== Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ====
In 1947, Bernstein conducted in [[Tel Aviv]] for the first time, beginning a lifelong association with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], then known as the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. The next year he conducted an open-air concert for Israeli troops at [[Beersheba]] in the middle of the desert during the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli war]]. In 1957, he conducted the inaugural concert of the [[Mann Auditorium]] in Tel Aviv. In 1967, he conducted a concert on [[Mount Scopus]] to commemorate the [[Reunification of Jerusalem]], featuring Mahler's Symphony No. 2 and Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with soloist [[Isaac Stern]]. During the 1970s, Bernstein recorded his symphonies and other works with the [[Israel Philharmonic]] on [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. The city of Tel Aviv added his name to the [[Habima Square|Orchestra Plaza]] in the center of the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==== First television appearance ====
On December 10, 1949, he made his first television appearance as conductor with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Carnegie Hall]]. The concert, which also included an address by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], celebrated the one-year anniversary of the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations General Assembly's]] ratification of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and included the premiere of [[Aaron Copland]]'s &quot;Preamble&quot; with [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]] narrating text from the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]]. The concert was televised by [[NBC|NBC Television Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The World Reimagined – Americans and Human Rights in the Twentieth Century |last=Bradley |first=Mark Philip |isbn=978-0521829755 |location=New York |oclc=946031535 |page=13 |date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Summer at Tanglewood ====
In April 1949, Bernstein performed as piano soloist in the world premiere of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Bernstein)|Symphony No. 2: The Age of Anxiety]] with Koussevitzy conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Later that year, Bernstein conducted the world premiere of the ''[[Turangalîla-Symphonie]]'' by [[Olivier Messiaen]], with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. Part of the rehearsal for the concert was recorded and released by the orchestra. When Koussevitzky died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting departments at Tanglewood.

===Early 1950s===
[[File:Leonard Bernstein - 1950s.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bernstein, c. 1950s]]

====''Peter Pan''====
In 1950, Bernstein composed incidental music for the Broadway play ''[[Peter Pan (1950 musical)|Peter Pan]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbaraanneshaircombblog.com/images/symphonyofthenewworld/benjaminsteinberg-leonardbernstein-peterpan.jpg ''Peter Pan'', music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein], ''[[Playbill]]'', April 24, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Jean Arthur]] as [[Peter Pan]], [[Boris Karloff]] in the dual roles of [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|George Darling]] and [[Captain Hook]], and [[Marcia Henderson]] as [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]].

==== Charles Ives ====
Throughout his career, Bernstein often talked about the music of [[Charles Ives]], who died in 1954. In 1951, Bernstein conducted the New York Philharmonic in the world premiere of Ives' [[Symphony No. 2 (Ives)|Symphony No. 2]], which was written around half a century earlier. The composer, old and frail, was unable (some reports say unwilling) to attend the concert, but his wife did. Ives reportedly listened to a broadcast of it on a radio in his kitchen some days later.

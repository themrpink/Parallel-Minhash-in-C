{{quote|We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a &quot;missing&quot; allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |title=WikiCrimeLine DNA profiling |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |access-date=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022013511/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |archive-date=2010-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===DNA testing in the United States===

===Development of artificial DNA===
In August 2009, scientists in [[Israel]] raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal ''Forensic Science International: Genetics'', the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18dna.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated, Scientists Show|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=August 18, 2009|access-date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, &quot;You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;/&gt; Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications, in particular, [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1186/s41935-018-0042-1|title = Crime investigation through DNA methylation analysis: Methods and applications in forensics| journal=Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=8|year = 2018|last1 = Rana|first1 = Ajay Kumar|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains [[methyl group]] modifications within a [[CpG dinucleotide]] context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this [[epigenetic]] modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot; /&gt;

It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.&lt;ref name=&quot;frumkin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(09)00099-4/abstract |title=Authentication of forensic DNA samples |journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=95–103 |access-date=2010-04-03|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2009.06.009 |pmid=20129467 |year=2010 |last1=Frumkin |first1=Dan |last2=Wasserstrom |first2=Adam |last3=Davidson |first3=Ariane |last4=Grafit |first4=Arnon |citeseerx=10.1.1.179.2718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases===
* In 1986, Richard Buckland was exonerated, despite having admitted to the rape and murder of a teenager near [[Leicester]], the city where DNA profiling was first developed. This was the first use of DNA fingerprinting in a criminal investigation, and the first to prove a suspect's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8245312.stm|work=BBC News|title=DNA pioneer's 'eureka' moment|date=September 9, 2009|access-date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified as the perpetrator of the same murder, in addition to another, using the same techniques that had cleared Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wambaugh, ''The Blooding'' (New York, New York: A Perigord Press Book, 1989), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1987, [[Florida]] rapist Tommie Lee Andrews was the first person in the United States to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for raping a woman during a burglary; he was convicted on November 6, 1987, and sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txtwriter.com/Backgrounders/Genetech/GEpage14.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021127041646/http://txtwriter.com/Backgrounders/Genetech/GEpage14.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-11-27 |title=Gene Technology |page =14 |publisher=Txtwriter.com |date=1987-11-06 |access-date=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/case/revolution/databases.html |title=frontline: the case for innocence: the dna revolution: state and federal dna database laws examined |publisher=Pbs.org |access-date=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1988, [[Timothy Wilson Spencer]] was the first man in [[Virginia]] to be sentenced to death through DNA testing, for several rape and murder charges. He was dubbed &quot;The South Side Strangler&quot; because he killed victims on the south side of Richmond, Virginia. He was later charged with rape and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He was executed on April 27, 1994. David Vasquez, initially convicted of one of Spencer's crimes, became the first man in [[United States|America]] exonerated based on DNA evidence.
* In 1989, [[Chicago]] man [[Gary Dotson]] was the first person whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
* In 1990, a violent murder of a young student in [[Brno]] was the first criminal case in [[Czechoslovakia]] solved by DNA evidence, with the murderer sentenced to 23 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dvojka.rozhlas.cz/jak-usvedcit-vraha-omilostneneho-prezidentem-6942979|title=Jak usvědčit vraha omilostněného prezidentem?|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|date=2020-01-29|language=cs|access-date=2020-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/lubas/lubas_a.html|title=Milan Lubas - a sex aggressor and murderer|publisher=Kriminalistika.eu|last=Jedlička|first=Miloslav|translator-last=Vršovský|translator-first=Pavel|access-date=2020-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1991, [[Allan Legere]] was the first [[Canadians|Canadian]] to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for four murders he had committed while an escaped prisoner in 1989. During his trial, his defense argued that the relatively shallow gene pool of the region could lead to false positives.
* In 1992, DNA evidence was used to prove that [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctor [[Josef Mengele]] was buried in [[Brazil]] under the name Wolfgang Gerhard.
* In 1992, DNA from a palo verde tree was used to convict Mark Alan Bogan of murder. DNA from seed pods of a tree at the crime scene was found to match that of seed pods found in Bogan's truck.

* In 1993, [[Kirk Bloodsworth]] was the first person to have been convicted of [[murder]] and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
* The 1993 rape and murder of [[Mia Zapata]], lead singer for the Seattle punk band [[The Gits]], was unsolved nine years after the murder. A database search in 2001 failed, but the killer's DNA was collected when he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.
* The science was made famous in the [[United States]] in 1994 when prosecutors heavily relied on DNA evidence allegedly linking [[O. J. Simpson]] to a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|double murder]]. The case also brought to light the laboratory difficulties and handling procedure mishaps that can cause such evidence to be significantly doubted.
* In 1994, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) detectives successfully tested hairs from a cat known as [[Snowball the Cat|Snowball]], and used the test to link a man to the murder of his wife, thus marking for the first time in forensic history the use of non-human animal DNA to identify a criminal (plant DNA was used in 1992, see above).
* In 1994, the claim that [[Anna Anderson]] was [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]] was tested after her death using samples of her tissue that had been stored at a Charlottesville, Virginia hospital following a medical procedure. The tissue was tested using DNA fingerprinting, and showed that she bore no relation to the [[Romanovs]].&lt;ref&gt;Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis by Peter Gill, Central Research and Support Establishment, Forensic Science Service, Aldermaston, Reading, Berkshire, RG7 4PN, UK, Pavel L.

* In 1994, [[Earl Washington, Jr.]], of Virginia had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment a week before his scheduled execution date based on DNA evidence. He received a full pardon in 2000 based on more advanced testing.&lt;ref name = DNA&gt;Murnaghan, Ian, (28 December 2012) [http://www.exploredna.co.uk/famous-trials-dna-testing.html Famous Trials and DNA Testing; Earl Washington Jr.] Explore DNA, Retrieved 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His case is often cited by opponents of the [[death penalty]].
* In 1995, the British [[Forensic Science Service]] carried out its first mass intelligence DNA screening in the investigation of the [[Murder of Naomi Smith|Naomi Smith]] murder case.
* In 1998, [[Richard J. Schmidt]] was convicted of attempted second-degree murder when it was shown that there was a link between the [[viral DNA]] of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) he had been accused of injecting in his girlfriend and viral DNA from one of his patients with AIDS. This was the first time viral DNA fingerprinting had been used as evidence in a criminal trial.
* In 1999, Raymond Easton, a disabled man from [[Swindon]], England, was arrested and detained for seven hours in connection with a burglary. He was released due to an inaccurate DNA match. His DNA had been retained on file after an unrelated domestic incident some time previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1933724,00.html |title = Suspect Nation |newspaper = The Guardian |date = 2006-10-08|location=London|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|access-date=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000 Frank Lee Smith was proved innocent by DNA profiling of the murder of an eight-year-old girl after spending 14 years on death row in Florida, USA. However he had died of cancer just before his innocence was proven.&lt;ref&gt;(June 2012) [http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3644 Frank Lee Smith] The University of Michigan Law School, National Registry of Exonerations, Retrieved 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In view of this the Florida state governor ordered that in future any death row inmate claiming innocence should have DNA testing.&lt;ref name = DNA/&gt;
* In May 2000 Gordon Graham murdered Paul Gault at his home in [[Lisburn]], Northern Ireland. Graham was convicted of the murder when his DNA was found on a sports bag left in the house as part of an elaborate ploy to suggest the murder occurred after a burglary had gone wrong. Graham was having an affair with the victim's wife at the time of the murder. It was the first time Low Copy Number DNA was used in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/freedom-in-bag-for-killer-graham-13906320.html |title=Freedom in bag for killer Graham? |first=Stephen |last=Gordon |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=2008-02-17 |access-date=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2002, the body of [[James Hanratty]], hanged in 1962 for the &quot;A6 murder&quot;, was exhumed and DNA samples from the body and members of his family were analysed.  The results convinced [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] judges that Hanratty's guilt, which had been strenuously disputed by campaigners, was proved &quot;beyond doubt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rozenberg&quot;&gt;Joshua Rozenberg,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1393842/DNA-proves-Hanratty-guilt-%27beyond-doubt%27.html &quot;DNA proves Hanratty guilt 'beyond doubt{{'&quot;}}], ''Daily Telegraph'', London, 11 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Foot and some other campaigners continued to believe in Hanratty's innocence and argued that the DNA evidence could have been contaminated, noting that the small DNA samples from items of clothing, kept in a police laboratory for over 40 years &quot;in conditions that do not satisfy modern evidential standards&quot;, had had to be subjected to very new amplification techniques in order to yield any genetic profile.&lt;ref&gt;John Steele, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1315138/Hanratty-lawyers-reject-DNA-guilt.html &quot;Hanratty lawyers reject DNA 'guilt{{'&quot;}}], ''Daily Telegraph'', London, 23 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no DNA other than Hanratty's was found on the evidence tested, contrary to what would have been expected had the evidence indeed been contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | journal=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1980731.stm | date=10 May 2002 | title=Hanratty: The damning DNA | access-date=2011-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, DNA testing was used to exonerate [[Douglas Echols]], a man who was wrongfully convicted in a 1986 rape case. Echols was the 114th person to be exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing.
* In August 2002, Annalisa Vincenzi was shot dead in [[Tuscany]]. Bartender Peter Hamkin, 23, was arrested, in [[Merseyside]] in March 2003 on an extradition warrant heard at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] in [[London]] to establish whether he should be taken to [[Italy]] to face a murder charge.

* In March 2003, Josiah Sutton was released from prison after serving four years of a twelve-year sentence for a sexual assault charge. Questionable DNA samples taken from Sutton were retested in the wake of the [[Houston Police Department]]'s crime lab scandal of mishandling DNA evidence.
* In June 2003, because of new DNA evidence, Dennis Halstead, John Kogut and John Restivo won a re-trial on their murder conviction, their convictions were struck down and they were released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3273 Dennis Halstead]. The National Registry of Exonerations, University of Michigan Law School, 18 April 2014. Retrieved 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The three men had already served eighteen years of their thirty-plus-year sentences.
* The trial of [[Robert Pickton]] (convicted in December 2003) is notable in that DNA evidence is being used primarily to identify the ''victims'', and in many cases to prove their existence.
* In 2004, DNA testing shed new light into the mysterious 1912 disappearance of [[Bobby Dunbar]], a four-year-old boy who vanished during a fishing trip. He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters' custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the kidnapping. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-05-1914-dna_x.htm DNA clears man of 1914 kidnapping conviction]&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'', (May 5, 2004), by Allen G. Breed, [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the [[University of Michigan]], after DNA found on Mixer's [[pantyhose]] was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/22/48hours/main1066064.shtml CBS News] story on the Jane Mixer murder case; March 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/earlyshow/main3065082.shtml CBS News] story on the Mixer case; July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyisinnocent.org/ An advocacy site] challenging Leiterman's conviction in the Mixer murder.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In March 2009, [[Sean Hodgson]]—convicted of 1979 killing of Teresa De Simone, 22, in her car in [[Southampton]]—was released after tests proved DNA from the scene was not his. It was later matched to DNA retrieved from the exhumed body of David Lace. Lace had previously confessed to the crime but was not believed by the detectives. He served time in prison for other crimes committed at the same time as the murder and then committed suicide in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Jenny|title=Police name David Lace as true killer of Teresa De Simone|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6838034.ece|website=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, familial DNA profiling led to Alice Collins Plebuch's unexpected discovery that her ancestral bloodline was not purely Irish, as she had previously been led to believe, but that her heritage also contained European Jewish, Middle Eastern and Eastern European. This led her into an extensive genealogy investigation which resulted in her uncovering the genetic family of her father who had been switched at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who Was She?

* In 2016 Anthea Ring, abandoned as baby, was able to use a DNA sample and DNA matching database to discover her deceased mother's identity and roots in County Mayo, Ireland. A recently developed forensic test was subsequently used to capture DNA from saliva left on old stamps and envelopes by her suspected father, uncovered through painstaking genealogy research. The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However, on the fourth, more than enough DNA was found.

* In 2019, dismembered remains found in a cave in Idaho in 1979 and 1991 were identified through genetic fingerprinting as belonging to [[Joseph Henry Loveless]]. Loveless was a habitual criminal who had disappeared after escaping from jail in 1916, where he had been charged with killing his wife Agnes with an axe. Clothes found with the remains matched the description of those Loveless was wearing when he made his escape.

==Education and early life==
Jeffreys was born into a middle-class family in [[Oxford]], where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956 when the family moved to [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He attributes his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; When he was eight, his father gave him a [[chemistry set]], which he enhanced over the next few years with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulphuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard).&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; His father also bought him a [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] brass [[microscope]],&lt;ref name = &quot;nature med 2005&quot;/&gt; which he used to examine biological specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a [[bumblebee]], but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a deceased cat on the road while doing his [[Newspaper delivery|paper round]] and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt;

Jeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then [[Luton Sixth Form College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UofL 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |title=The Gene Genius |date=September 2004 |publisher=University of Leicester |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109215809/http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to study at [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1971 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name=CV-AJ/&gt; Jeffreys completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree on the [[mitochondria]] of cultured mammalian cells, as a postgraduate student at the Genetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref name=jeffreysphd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Alec|last=Jeffreys |title=Studies on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1975 |url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph019879695|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.460797}}|oclc=500483911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==

After finishing his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow,&lt;ref name = &quot;UofL 2004&quot;/&gt; and then to the [[University of Leicester]] in 1977, wherein 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing [[genetic fingerprinting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;welcome 2004&quot;/&gt;

===Genetic fingerprinting===
Jeffreys says he had a &quot;[[eureka moment]]&quot; in his lab in Leicester after looking at the [[X-ray]] film image of a [[DNA]] experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;welcome 2004&quot;/&gt; Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has become important in [[forensic science]] to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife [[population genetics]] studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA Fingerprinting Zoology 2014&quot; /&gt; Before his methods were commercialized in 1987, his laboratory was the only center in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt; This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys' work, in this case, prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s 1989 best-selling book ''The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders'' and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 1 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series ''[[Forensic Files|Medical Detectives]]'' in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, ''[[Code of a Killer]]''. In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the body of [[Josef Mengele]], who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a [[femur]] bone of his exhumed skeleton,&lt;ref name = &quot;nature med 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = J. | title = Ten years of biotech gaffes|doi = 10.1038/nbt0306-270|journal = Nature Biotechnology|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 270–273|year = 2006|pmid =  16525384| s2cid = 560311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIDiscs AJ&quot;/&gt;

===DNA profiling===
[[DNA profiling]], based on typing individual highly variable [[minisatellite]]s in the [[human genome]], was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many [[minisatellite]]s simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and [[paternity testing]] worldwide.

The development of DNA amplification by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity, and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable [[microsatellite]]s, also known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the [[Joseph Mengele|Mengele]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD) in 1995.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen microsatellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland).&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA and Crime Investigation: Scotland and the UK National DNA Database&quot;/&gt; The national database in 2020 contained the DNA information of about 5.6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|date=September 2020|title=National DNA Database Strategy Board Biennial Report 2018 - 2020|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/913015/NDNAD_Strategy_Board_AR_2018-2020_print.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 November 2020|website=UK Home Office|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|page=10|isbn=978-1-5286-1916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database,&lt;ref name=&quot;The informer in your blood&quot;/&gt; and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Privacy fears over DNA database&quot;/&gt;

'''Batumi''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|ˈ|t|uː|m|i}}; {{lang-ka|ბათუმი}} {{IPA-ka|bɑtʰumi||}}; {{lang-tr|Batum}}) is the second largest city of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the capital of the [[Autonomous Republic of Adjara]], located on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] in Georgia's southwest. It is situated in a subtropical zone at the foot of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]]. Much of Batumi's economy revolves around tourism and [[gambling]] (it is nicknamed &quot;The Las Vegas of the Black Sea&quot;), but the city is also an important sea [[port]] and includes industries like [[shipbuilding]], [[food processing]] and [[light manufacturing]]. Since 2010, Batumi has been transformed by the construction of modern high-rise buildings, as well as the restoration of classical 19th-century edifices lining its historic Old Town.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/travel/12next.html?gwh=BE83092F7804AF60154D9C732B91C5C2&amp;gwt=pay|title = Glamour revives port of Batumi|last = Spritzer|first = Dinah|date = 9 September 2010|access-date = 24 December 2014|newspaper = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Batumi|Timeline of Batumi}}

===Early history===
Batumi is located on the site of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony in [[Colchis]] called &quot;''Bathus&quot;'' or &quot;''Bathys&quot;'' – derived from ({{lang-grc-gre|βαθύς λιμεν}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|bathus limen}}; or {{lang|grc|βαθύς λιμήν}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|bathys limēn}}; [[literal translation|lit.]] the 'deep harbor'). Under [[Hadrian]] ({{circa|117–138 AD}}), it was converted into a fortified [[Roman Empire|Roman]] port and later deserted for the fortress of [[Petra, Lazica|Petra]] founded in the time of [[Justinian I]] ({{ca.|527–565}}). Garrisoned by the Roman-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces, it was formally a possession of the kingdom of [[Lazica]] until being occupied briefly by the [[Caliphate|Arabs]], who did not hold it; In 780 Lazica fell to [[kingdom of Abkhazia]] via a dynastic union, the later led the unification of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century.

Shortly after Hardy's death, the executors of his estate burnt his letters and notebooks, but twelve notebooks survived, one of them containing notes and extracts of newspaper stories from the 1820s, and research into these has provided insight into how Hardy used them in his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC200803&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/thomas_hardy.shtml |title=Homeground: Dead man talking |date=20 August 2003 |work=BBC Online |accessdate=2006-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831225219/http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/thomas_hardy.shtml |archivedate=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of his death Mrs Hardy published ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1841–1891'', compiled largely from contemporary notes, letters, diaries, and biographical memoranda, as well as from oral information in conversations extending over many years.

Hardy's work was admired by many younger writers, including [[D. H. Lawrence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Study of Thomas Hardy and other essays |origyear=1914 |editor-first=Bruce |editor-last=Steele |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-25252-0 |chapter=Literary criticism and metaphysics}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cowper Powys]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Novels of Thomas Hardy&quot;, ''The Common Reader'', 2nd series.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' (1929), [[Robert Graves]] recalls meeting Hardy in Dorset in the early 1920s and how Hardy received him and his new wife warmly, and was encouraging about his work.

Hardy's first novel, ''[[The Poor Man and the Lady]]'', finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, [[George Meredith]], who felt that ''The Poor Man and the Lady'' would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullen2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B.

After he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, ''[[Desperate Remedies]]'' (1871) and ''[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]'' (1872), both of which were published anonymously; it was while working on the latter that he met Emma Gifford, who would become his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullen2013&quot;/&gt; In 1873 ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'', a novel drawing on Hardy's courtship of Emma, was published under his own name. A plot device popularised by [[Charles Dickens]], the term &quot;[[cliffhanger]]&quot; is considered to have originated with the serialised version of ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' (published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hardy|title=Delphi Complete Works of Thomas Hardy (Illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1EbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT570|date=17 November 2013|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=978-1-908909-17-6|pages=570–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|magazine=The New Yorker|date=10 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of Hardy's fiction reflect the influence of the commercially successful sensation fiction of the 1860s, particularly the legal complications in novels such as ''Desperate Remedies'' (1871), ''Far from the Madding Crowd'' (1874) and ''Two on a Tower'' (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Trish Ferguson, ''Thomas Hardy's Legal Fictions'', Edinburgh University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'', Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]. Wessex had been the name of an early [[Saxon]] kingdom, in approximately the same part of England. ''Far from the Madding Crowd'' was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career. Over the next 25 years, Hardy produced 10 more novels.

Subsequently, the Hardys moved from London to [[Yeovil]], and then to [[Sturminster Newton]], where he wrote ''[[The Return of the Native]]'' (1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2013/06/curiosities-of-sturminster-newton/|title=Curiosities of Sturminster Newton  -  Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine|website=www.dorsetlife.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Hardy published his only historical novel, ''[[The Trumpet-Major]]''. Hardy published ''[[Two on a Tower]]'' in 1882, a romance story set in the world of astronomy. Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to [[Max Gate]], a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother. There he wrote ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886), ''[[The Woodlanders]]'' (1887), and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a &quot;fallen woman&quot;, and initially it was refused publication. Its subtitle, ''A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented'', was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes.
[[File:Thomas Hardy Locations, Return of the Native - geograph.org.uk - 786542.jpg|thumb|A major location of ''[[The Return of the Native]]'' as part of Hardy's fictional [[Egdon Heath]].]]

''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', published in 1895, met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage. Its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused strain on Hardy's already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that ''Jude the Obscure'' would be read as autobiographical. Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and [[Walsham How]], the [[Bishop of Wakefield (diocese)|Bishop of Wakefield]], is reputed to have burnt his copy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC200803&quot;/&gt; In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: &quot;After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop – probably in his despair at not being able to burn me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jude the Obscure |last= Hardy |first= Thomas |year= 1998 |publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn= 0-14-043538-7 |page= 466 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txZevBW0iX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;#PPA466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Hardy had become a celebrity by the 1900s, but some argue that he gave up writing novels because of the criticism of both ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' and ''Jude the Obscure''.&lt;ref name=&quot;English Literature 2000&quot;&gt;&quot;Thomas Hardy&quot;, ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol.2 .

==Literary themes==
Considered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in [[Victorian England]], and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people's lives and caused unhappiness. Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet [[Philip Larkin]] as central in Hardy's works:

::&quot;What is the intensely maturing experience of which Hardy's modern man is most sensible?  In my view it is suffering, or sadness, and extended consideration of the centrality of suffering in Hardy's work should be the first duty of the true critic for which the work is still waiting [. . .] Any approach to his work, as to any writer's work, must seek first of all to determine what element is peculiarly his, which imaginative note he strikes most plangently, and to deny that in this case it is the sometimes gentle, sometimes ironic, sometimes bitter but always passive apprehension of suffering is, I think, wrong-headed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Philip 1983, &quot;Wanted: Good Hardy Critic&quot; in ''Required Writing'', London: [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Two on a Tower'', for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class. The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between women and men. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.

{{quote|In a novel structured around contrasts, the main opposition is between Swithin St Cleeve and Lady Viviette Constantine, who are presented as binary figures in a series of ways: aristocratic and lower class, youthful and mature, single and married, fair and dark, religious and agnostic...she [Lady Viviette Constantine] is also deeply conventional, absurdly wishing to conceal their marriage until Swithin has achieved social status through his scientific work, which gives rise to uncontrolled ironies and tragic-comic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Harvey, ''Thomas Hardy: The Complete Critical Guide to Thomas Hardy.'' New York: Routledge, 2003, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fate or chance is another important theme. Hardy's characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work. ''Far from the Madding Crowd'' is an example of a novel in which chance has a major role: &quot;Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/twentieth-century-criticism/far-from-madding-crowd-thomas-hardy |title=Far from the Madding Crowd, Thomas Hardy – Introduction (Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Linda Pavlovski. Vol. 153. Gale Group, Inc.,) |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate= 7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Hardy's main characters often seem to be held in fate's overwhelming grip.

==Poetry==
[[File:Thomas Hardy by Walter William Ouless.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Hardy by [[Walter William Ouless]], 1922]]
In 1898, Hardy published his first volume of poetry, ''[[Wessex Poems]]'', a collection of poems written over 30 years. While some suggest that Hardy gave up writing novels following the harsh criticism of ''Jude the Obscure'' in 1896, the poet [[C. H. Sisson]] calls this &quot;hypothesis&quot; &quot;superficial and absurd&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;English Literature 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Introduction&quot; to the Penguin edition of ''Jude the Obscure'' (1978). Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century Hardy published only poetry.

Thomas Hardy wrote in a great variety of poetic forms, including [[lyric poetry|lyrics]], [[ballad]]s, satire, [[dramatic monologue]]s, and dialogue, as well as a three-volume epic closet drama ''[[The Dynasts]]'' (1904–08),&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255167/Thomas-Hardy |title=Thomas Hardy (British writer) – Encyclopædia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though in some ways a very traditional poet, because he was influenced by folksong and ballads,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Thomas Hardy&quot;, ''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; he &quot;was never conventional,&quot; and &quot;persistently experiment[ed] with different, often invented, stanza forms and metres,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide'', p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; and made use of &quot;rough-hewn rhythms and colloquial diction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;poets1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/110#sthash.STdc5gsw.dpuf |title=Thomas Hardy &amp;#124; Academy of American Poets |publisher=Poets.org |date=11 January 1928 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to both the [[Boer War]]s and [[World War I]], including &quot;Drummer Hodge&quot;, &quot;In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'&quot;, and &quot;[[The Man He Killed]]&quot;; his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as [[Rupert Brooke]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Axelrod |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/thomas-hardy |title=Thomas Hardy |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;/&gt; A theme in the ''[[Wessex Poems]]'' is the long shadow that the [[Napoleonic Wars]] cast over the 19th century, as seen, for example, in &quot;The Sergeant's Song&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Kearney Maynard, ''Thomas Hardy's Tragic Poetry: The Lyrics and The Dynasts''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991, pp.8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Napoleonic War is the subject of ''The Dynasts''.

Some of Hardy's more famous poems are from &quot;Poems of 1912–13&quot;, part of ''Satires of Circumstance'' (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912. They had been estranged for 20 years, and these lyric poems express deeply felt &quot;regret and remorse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod&quot;/&gt; Poems like &quot;After a Journey&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, and others from this collection &quot;are by general consent regarded as the peak of his poetic achievement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt; In a recent biography on Hardy, [[Claire Tomalin]] argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, beginning with these elegies, which she describes as among &quot;the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire. &quot;Thomas Hardy.&quot; New York: Penguin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Hardy (1923 portrait).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A portrait of Thomas Hardy in 1923 by [[Reginald Eves]]]]
Many of Hardy's poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and &quot;the perversity of fate&quot;, but the best of them present these themes with &quot;a carefully controlled elegiac feeling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol. 2, p.1916.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irony]] is an important element in a number of Hardy's poems, including &quot;The Man he Killed&quot; and &quot;Are You Digging on My Grave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Kearney Maynard, ''Thomas Hardy's Tragic Poetry: The Lyrics and The Dynasts''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991, pp8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of Hardy's poems, such as &quot;[[The Blinded Bird]]&quot;, a melancholy polemic against the sport of {{lang|nl|[[Vinkensport|vinkenzetting]]}}, reflect his firm stance against animal cruelty, exhibited in his [[Vivisection|antivivisectionist]] views and his membership in The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/wakinggiantspres00schn_0

A number of notable English composers, including [[Gerald Finzi]],&lt;ref&gt;Song cycle ''[[Earth and Air and Rain]]'' (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geraldfinzi.com/biography/ |title=Biography &quot; Gerald Finzi Official Site |publisher=Geraldfinzi.com |date=27 September 1956 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Britten]],&lt;ref&gt;Song cycle ''[[Winter Words (song cycle)|Winter Words]]'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Sinclair Wells]], and [[Gustav Holst]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lieder.net/get_settings.html?ComposerId=1237 |title=Gustav Holst (Vocal Texts and Translations for Composer Gustav Holst) |publisher=LiederNet Archive |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set poems by Hardy to music. Holst also wrote the orchestral tone poem ''[[Egdon Heath (Holst)|Egdon Heath: A Homage to Thomas Hardy]]'' in 1927.

Although his poems were initially not as well received as his novels had been, Hardy is now recognised as one of the great poets of the 20th century, and his verse had a profound influence on later writers, including [[Robert Frost]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Dylan Thomas]], and [[Philip Larkin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;poets1&quot;/&gt; Larkin included 27 poems by Hardy compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]] in his edition of the ''Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/110 |title=Poetry.org |publisher=Poets.org |date=11 January 1928 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were fewer poems by [[W. B. Yeats]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Thomas Hardy&quot;, ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol.2, p.1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
[[File:Thomas Hardy aged 70, by William Strang.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Hardy aged 70, by [[William Strang]]]]
Hardy's family was [[Anglican]], but not especially devout. He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music. He did not attend the local [[Church of England]] school, instead being sent to Mr Last's school, three miles away. As a young adult, he befriended [[Henry R. Bastow]] (a [[Plymouth Brethren]] man), who also worked as a pupil architect, and who was preparing for [[adult baptism]] in the [[Baptist Church]]. Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Tomalin, Thomas Hardy, The Time Torn Man(Penguin, 2007), pp.46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Bastow went to Australia and maintained a long correspondence with Hardy, but eventually Hardy tired of these exchanges and the correspondence ceased. This concluded Hardy's links with the Baptists.

The irony and struggles of life, coupled with his naturally curious mind, led him to question the traditional Christian view of God: 
{{quote|The Christian God&amp;nbsp;– the external personality&amp;nbsp;– has been replaced by the intelligence of the First Cause...the replacement of the old concept of God as all-powerful by a new concept of universal consciousness. The 'tribal god, man-shaped, fiery-faced and tyrannous' is replaced by the 'unconscious will of the Universe' which progressively grows aware of itself and 'ultimately, it is to be hoped, sympathetic'.&lt;ref&gt;Wotton, G. (1985), ''Thomas Hardy: Towards A Materialist Criticism'', Lanham: [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], p.36&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Scholars have debated Hardy's religious leanings for years, often unable to reach a consensus. Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman, Dr. A.B. Grosart, about the question of reconciling the horrors of human and animal life with &quot;the absolute goodness and non-limitation of God&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Florence Emily Hardy, ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840–1891'', p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy replied,
{{quote|Mr. Hardy regrets that he is unable to offer any hypothesis which would reconcile the existence of such evils as [[Alexander Grosart|Dr. Grosart]] describes with the idea of omnipotent goodness. Perhaps Dr. Grosart might be helped to a provisional view of the universe by the recently published ''Life of Darwin'' and the works of [[Herbert Spencer]] and other agnostics.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt;}}

Hardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits.&lt;ref name=norton&gt;Ellman, Richard, &amp; O'
Clair, Robert (eds.) 1988. &quot;Thomas Hardy&quot; in ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', Norton, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels. 
Hardy's friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included [[Horatio Mosley Moule|Horace Moule]] (one of the eight sons of [[Henry Moule]]), and the poet [[William Barnes]], both ministers of religion. Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/0,9130,1489987-,00.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622162641/http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/0,9130,1489987-,00.html |date=22 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those of [[Gideon Mantell]]. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book ''The Wonders of Geology'' (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are &quot;compelling similarities&quot; between the &quot;cliffhanger&quot; section from ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' and Mantell's geological descriptions. It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' was based on Horace Moule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/index.php/19/article/viewFile/469/329 |title=Adelene Buckland: ''Thomas Hardy, Provincial Geology and the Material Imagination'' |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Hardy's heart.JPG|thumb|upright|Grave of Thomas Hardy's heart at [[Stinsford]] parish church]]

Throughout his life, Hardy sought a rationale for believing in an afterlife or a timeless existence, turning first to spiritualists, such as Henri Bergson, and then to Albert Einstein and J. M. E. McTaggart, considering their philosophy on time and space in relation to immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Trish Ferguson, '&quot;Time’s Renewal&quot;: Death and Immortality in Thomas Hardy’s 'Emma poems'', ''Literature and Modern Time: Technological Modernity, Glimpses of Eternity, Experiments with Time'', Palgrave, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Hardy corresponded with and visited [[Charles George Milnes Gaskell|Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell]] at [[Wenlock Abbey]] and many of Lady Catherine's books are inspired by Hardy, who was very fond of her.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, 2015 Wenlock Abbey 1857–1919: A Shropshire Country House and the Milnes Gaskell Family, Ellingham Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Study of Thomas Hardy'' (1936) indicates the importance of Hardy for him, even though this work is a platform for Lawrence's own developing philosophy rather than a more standard literary study. The influence of Hardy's treatment of character, and Lawrence's own response to the central [[metaphysic]] behind many of Hardy's novels, helped significantly in the development of ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915) and ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Terry R.

''Wood and Stone'' (1915), the first novel by [[John Cowper Powys]], who was a contemporary of Lawrence, was &quot;Dedicated with devoted admiration to the greatest poet and novelist of our age Thomas Hardy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Terry R.

The [[symphonic poem]]s ''[[Mai-Dun]]'' by [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (1921) and ''[[Egdon Heath (Holst)|Egdon Heath]]'' by [[Gustav Holst]] (1927) evoke the landscape of Hardy's novels.

Hardy has been a significant influence on Nigel Blackwell, frontman of the [[post-punk]] British rock band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]], who has often incorporated phrases (some obscure) by or about Hardy into his song lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jul/21/weekend7.weekend6 |title=Taking the biscuit |first=Kevin |last=Sampson |authorlink=Kevin Sampson (writer) |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 July 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example the song title &quot;[[Thy Damnation Slumbereth Not]]&quot;, which is a quotation from Thomas Hardy's novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'',{{cite book|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/etexts/hardy/tess-0012.shtml|last=Hardy|first=Thomas|title=Tess of the d'Urbervilles|at=Chapter 12|year=1891

Hardy also produced minor tales; one story, ''The Spectre of the Real'' (1894) was written in collaboration with [[Florence Henniker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Hardy And Florence Henniker: The Writing Of &quot;The Spectre of the Real|first=Richard |last=Purdy|journal=Colby Library Quarterly  |volume=1 |issue=8  |date= October 1944|pages=122–6|url=http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cq/vol1/iss8/4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional short-story collection, beyond the ones mentioned above, is ''[[A Changed Man and Other Tales]]'' (1913). His works have been collected as the 24-volume Wessex Edition (1912–13) and the 37-volume Mellstock Edition (1919–20). His largely self-written biography appears under his second wife's name in two volumes from 1928 to 1930, as ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840–91'' and ''The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892–1928'', now published in a critical one-volume edition as ''The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy'', edited by Michael Millgate (1984).

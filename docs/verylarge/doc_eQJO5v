=== Gauge bosons ===
[[File:Standard Model Feynman Diagram Vertices.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|The above interactions form the basis of the standard model. Feynman diagrams in the standard model are built from these vertices. Modifications involving Higgs boson interactions and neutrino oscillations are omitted. The charge of the W bosons is dictated by the fermions they interact with; the conjugate of each listed vertex (i.e. reversing the direction of arrows) is also allowed.]]

In the Standard Model, [[gauge boson]]s are defined as [[force carrier]]s that mediate the strong, weak, and electromagnetic [[fundamental interaction]]s.

Interactions in physics are the ways that particles influence other particles. At a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic level]], electromagnetism allows particles to interact with one another via [[electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, and gravitation allows particles with mass to attract one another in accordance with Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. The Standard Model explains such forces as resulting from matter particles [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|exchanging other particles]], generally referred to as ''force mediating particles''. When a force-mediating particle is exchanged, the effect at a macroscopic level is equivalent to a force influencing both of them, and the particle is therefore said to have ''mediated'' (i.e., been the agent of) that force. The [[Feynman diagram]] calculations, which are a graphical representation of the [[perturbation theory]] approximation, invoke &quot;force mediating particles&quot;, and when applied to analyze [[particle accelerator|high-energy scattering experiments]] are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a &quot;force-mediating particle&quot;) fails in other situations. These include low-energy [[quantum chromodynamics]], [[bound state]]s, and [[soliton]]s.

The gauge bosons of the Standard Model all have [[spin (physics)|spin]] (as do matter particles). The value of the spin is 1, making them [[boson]]s. As a result, they do not follow the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] that constrains [[fermion]]s: thus bosons (e.g. photons) do not have a theoretical limit on their [[volume number density|spatial density (number per volume)]]. The types of gauge bosons are described below.
* [[Photon]]s mediate the electromagnetic force between electrically charged particles. The photon is massless and is well-described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].
* The [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}}]] gauge bosons mediate the [[weak interaction]]s between particles of different [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]] (all [[quark]]s and leptons). They are massive, with the {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} being more massive than the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}}. The weak interactions involving the {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} act only on [[Chirality (physics)|''left-handed'' particles and ''right-handed'' antiparticles]]. The {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+-}} carries an electric charge of +1 and −1 and couples to the electromagnetic interaction. The electrically neutral {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} boson interacts with both left-handed particles and antiparticles. These three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped together, as collectively mediating the [[electroweak]] interaction.
* The eight [[gluon]]s mediate the [[strong interaction]]s between [[color charge]]d particles (the quarks). Gluons are massless. The eightfold multiplicity of gluons is labeled by a combination of color and anticolor charge (e.g. red–antigreen).{{NoteTag|Technically, there are nine such color–anticolor combinations. However, one of these is a color-symmetric combination that can be constructed out of a linear superposition, reducing the count to eight.}} Because gluons have an effective color charge, they can also interact among themselves. Gluons and their interactions are described by the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]].

The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.

=== Higgs boson ===
{{Main|Higgs boson}}

The Higgs particle is a massive [[Scalar field theory|scalar]] elementary particle theorized by [[Peter Higgs]] in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|proposed as the Higgs boson]], and is a key building block in the Standard Model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Englert1964&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter W.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no intrinsic [[spin (physics)|spin]], and for that reason is classified as a [[boson]] (like the gauge bosons, which have [[integer]] spin).

The Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why the other elementary particles, except the [[photon]] and [[gluon]], are massive. In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the [[W and Z bosons]] are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses, and the differences between [[electromagnetism]] (mediated by the photon) and the [[weak force]] (mediated by the W and Z bosons), are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks.  As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.

Because the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy [[particle accelerator]] can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] began in early 2010 and were performed at [[Fermilab]]'s [[Tevatron]] until its closure in late 2011. Mathematical consistency of the Standard Model requires that any mechanism capable of generating the masses of elementary particles becomes visible{{clarify|reason=Isn't &quot;apparent&quot; or &quot;manifest&quot; needed here instead of &quot;visible&quot;?|date=July 2013}} at energies above {{val|1.4|ul=TeV}};&lt;ref&gt;

Technically, [[quantum field theory]] provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory.  Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical [[field (physics)|field]] that pervades [[space-time]].  The construction of the Standard Model proceeds following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general [[renormalization|renormalizable]] Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that observes these symmetries.

The [[Global symmetry|global]] [[Poincaré group|Poincaré symmetry]] is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories.  It consists of the familiar [[translational symmetry]], [[rotational symmetry]] and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of [[special relativity]].  The [[Local symmetry|local]] SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) [[gauge symmetry]] is an [[Internal symmetries|internal symmetry]] that essentially defines the Standard Model.  Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions.  The fields fall into different [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table).  Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment.  The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking &quot;show&quot;) above (note: the Higgs mass is at {{val|125|u=GeV}}, the Higgs self-coupling strength {{mvar|λ}} ~ {{frac|1|8}}).

==== Quantum chromodynamics sector ====
{{Main|Quantum chromodynamics}}
The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills gauge theory]] with SU(3) symmetry, generated by {{mvar|T&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{QCD} = \sum_\psi \overline{\psi}_i \left( i\gamma^\mu(\partial_\mu\delta_{ij} - i g_s G_\mu^a T^a_{ij})\right) \psi_j - \frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\nu} G^{\mu\nu}_a,&lt;/math&gt;
where
: {{mvar|ψ{{su|b=i}}}} is the Dirac spinor of the quark field, where ''i'' = {r, g, b} represents color,
: {{mvar|γ{{isup|μ}}}} are the [[Dirac matrices]],
: {{mvar|G{{su|b=μ|p=a}}}} is the 8-component (&lt;math&gt;a = 1, 2, \dots, 8&lt;/math&gt;) SU(3) gauge field,
: {{mvar|T{{su|b=ij|p=a}}}} are the 3 × 3 [[Gell-Mann matrices]], generators of the SU(3) color group,
: {{mvar|G{{su|b=μν|p=a}}}} represents the [[gluon field strength tensor]],
: {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the strong coupling constant.

==== Electroweak sector ====
{{Main|Electroweak interaction}}
The electroweak sector is a [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills gauge theory]] with the symmetry group U(1) × SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{EW} = \sum_\psi \bar\psi \gamma^\mu \left(i\partial_\mu - g' \tfrac12 Y_\text{W} B_\mu - g \tfrac12 \vec\tau_\text{L} \vec W_\mu\right)\psi - \tfrac{1}{4} W_a^{\mu\nu} W_{\mu\nu}^a - \tfrac{1}{4} B^{\mu\nu} B_{\mu\nu},&lt;/math&gt;
where
: {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the U(1) gauge field,
: {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[weak hypercharge]] – the generator of the U(1) group,
: {{math|{{vec|''W''}}&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the 3-component SU(2) gauge field,
: {{math|{{vec|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} are the [[Pauli matrices]] – infinitesimal generators of the SU(2) group – with subscript L to indicate that they only act on ''left''-chiral fermions,
: {{mvar|g'}} and {{mvar|g}} are the U(1) and SU(2) coupling constants respectively,
: &lt;math&gt;W^{a\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;a = 1, 2, 3&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;B^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[field strength tensor]]s for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge fields.

Notice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form &lt;math&gt;m\overline\psi\psi&lt;/math&gt; do not respect U(1) × SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.

==== Higgs sector ====
{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}
In the Standard Model, the [[Higgs field]] is a complex [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] of the group [[SU(2)]]&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \left(\begin{array}{c}\varphi^+ \\ \varphi^0\end{array}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge ({{mvar|Q}}) of the components. The weak hypercharge ({{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}}) of both components is 1.

Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{H} = \varphi^\dagger \left(\partial^\mu - \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_\text{W} B^\mu + g \vec\tau \vec W^\mu \right)\right) \left(\partial_\mu + \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_\text{W} B_\mu + g \vec\tau \vec W_\mu \right)\right)\varphi - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(\varphi^\dagger \varphi - v^2\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which up to a divergence term, (i.e. after partial integration) can also be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{H} = \left|\left(\partial_\mu + \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_\text{W} B_\mu + g \vec\tau \vec W_\mu \right)\right)\varphi\right|^2 - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left(\varphi^\dagger \varphi - v^2\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Yukawa sector ====

The [[Yukawa interaction]] terms are

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{Yukawa} = \overline U_L G_u U_R \varphi^0 - \overline D_L G_u U_R \varphi^- + \overline U_L G_d D_R \varphi^+ + \overline D_L G_d D_R \varphi^0 + hc,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;u,d&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{math|3 × 3}} matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the {{mvar|ij}} term giving the coupling of the generations {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}}.

==Fundamental interactions==
{{Main|Fundamental interaction}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}
The Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of [[boson]]s between the objects affected, such as a [[photon]] for the electromagnetic force and a [[gluon]] for the strong interaction. Those particles are called [[force carrier]]s or messenger [[particles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/standard-model Official CERN website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests and predictions ==

The Standard Model (SM) predicted the existence of the [[W and Z bosons]], [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s and predicted many of their properties before these particles were observed. The predictions were experimentally confirmed with good precision.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Woithe |first1=Julia |last2=Wiener |first2=Gerfried |last3=Van der Veken |first3=Frederik |title=Let's have a coffee with the Standard Model of particle physics! |journal=Phys.

Self-consistency of the Standard Model (currently formulated as a non-[[abelian group|abelian]] gauge theory quantized through path-integrals) has not been mathematically proven.  While regularized versions useful for approximate computations (for example [[lattice gauge theory]]) exist, it is not known whether they converge (in the sense of S-matrix elements) in the limit that the regulator is removed.  A key question related to the consistency is the [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap]] problem.

Experiments indicate that [[neutrinos]] have [[mass]], which the classic Standard Model did not allow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate this finding, the classic Standard Model can be modified to include neutrino mass.

If one insists on using only Standard Model particles, this can be achieved by adding a non-renormalizable interaction of leptons with the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as new physics appears below or around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; [[electronvolt|GeV]], the neutrino masses can be of the right order of magnitude.

Theoretical and experimental research has attempted to extend the Standard Model into a [[Unified field theory]] or a [[Theory of everything]], a complete theory explaining all physical phenomena including constants. Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such research include:
* The model does not explain [[gravitation]], although physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a [[graviton]] would account for it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, [[general relativity]], in terms of [[quantum field theory]]. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the [[Planck scale]]. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.
* Some physicists consider it to be ''ad hoc'' and inelegant, requiring 19 numerical constants whose values are unrelated and arbitrary.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlumhoferHutter1997&quot;&gt;

It is believed that explaining neutrino mass will require an additional 7 or 8 constants, which are also arbitrary parameters.&lt;ref&gt;

* The Higgs mechanism gives rise to the [[hierarchy problem]] if some new physics (coupled to the Higgs) is present at high energy scales. In these cases, in order for the weak scale to be much smaller than the [[Planck scale]], severe fine tuning of the parameters is required; there are, however, other scenarios that include [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] in which such fine tuning can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;

* The model is inconsistent with the emerging [[Lambda-CDM model]] of cosmology. Contentions include the absence of an explanation in the Standard Model of particle physics for the observed amount of [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and its contributions to [[dark energy]], which are many orders of magnitude too large. It is also difficult to accommodate the observed predominance of matter over antimatter ([[matter]]/[[antimatter]] [[Baryon asymmetry|asymmetry]]). The [[isotropic|isotropy]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of the visible universe over large distances seems to require a mechanism like cosmic [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], which would also constitute an extension of the Standard Model.

Currently, no proposed [[Theory of Everything]] has been widely accepted or verified.

}}
'''Castling''' is a move in the game of [[chess]] involving a player's [[king (chess)|king]] and either of the player's original [[rook (chess)|rooks]]. It is the only move in chess in which a player moves two pieces in the same move, and it is the only move aside from the [[knight (chess)|knight]]'s move where a piece can be said to &quot;jump over&quot; another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pandolfini |first=Bruce |year=1992 |title=Pandolfini's Chess Complete: The Most Comprehensive Guide to the Game, from History to Strategy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDup8NHQ8AC&amp;pg=PA34 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn= 9780671701864 |access-date=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first {{chessgloss|rank}}, then moving the rook to the square that the king crossed.{{refn|Article 3.8.2 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=FIDE Laws of Chess taking effect from 1 January 2018|url=https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018|access-date=12 July 2020|website=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Castling may be done only if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in [[check (chess)|check]], and the king does not cross over or end on a square attacked by an enemy piece. Castling is one of the [[rules of chess]] and is technically a king move {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=71}}.

The [[chess notation|notation]] for castling, in both the [[Descriptive chess notation|descriptive]] and the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic]] systems, is 0-0 with the {{chessgloss|kingside}} rook and 0-0-0 with the {{chessgloss|queenside}} rook; in [[Portable Game Notation|PGN]], O-O and O-O-O are used instead. Castling on the kingside is sometimes called ''castling short'' (the rook moves a short distance, i.e. two squares) while castling on the queenside is called ''castling long'' (the rook moves a long distance, i.e. three squares) {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

Castling was added to European chess in the 14th or 15th century and did not develop into its present form until the 17th century. The Asian versions of chess do not have such a move.

Castling is permissible provided all of the following conditions hold:{{refn|Article 3.8.2 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
# The castling must be {{chessgloss|kingside}} or {{chessgloss|queenside}}.{{refn|This rule per Article 3.8.2 of the FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt; requires that king and rook are on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}. In the FIDE rules before 1972, this requirement was not formally stated. It was only added in the FIDE rules in 1972 with the wording &quot;same rank&quot;. Without this requirement, it is possible to promote a pawn on the ''e'' {{chessgloss|file}} to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was &quot;discovered&quot; by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabbé]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabbé, see also [[:de:Pam-Krabbé-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.}}
# Neither the king nor the chosen rook has previously moved.
# There are no pieces between the king and the chosen rook.
# The king is not currently in [[check (chess)|check]].
# The king does not pass through a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.
# The king does not end up in check. (True of any legal move.)

Conditions 4 through 6 can be summarized with the more [[mnemonic device|memorable]] phrase: ''One may not castle out of, through, or into check.''

In 2010, Li's autobiographical work, ''[[The Critical Moment – Li Peng Diaries]]'', was published by New Century Press. ''The Critical Moment'' covered Li's activities during the period of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]], and was published on the protests' twenty-first anniversary. ''The Critical Moment'' was characterized by reviewers as largely an attempt to minimize Li's culpability during the most egregious stages of the crackdown; some also say he attempted to shift blame to Deng.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asianews&quot; /&gt; He reappeared at the [[19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|19th Party Congress]] on 18 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2017-10-18/60018045.html |script-title=zh:李鹏亮相十九大 媒体：并非外界所传病危 |work=Duowei News |date=2017-10-18 |accessdate=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Li Peng was married to Zhu Lin ({{zh|labels=no|c=朱琳}}), a deputy manager in &quot;a large firm in the south of China&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMW2&quot; /&gt; Li and Zhu had 3 children:&lt;ref&gt;''Asiaweek.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Li's elder son, [[Li Xiaopeng (politician)|Li Xiaopeng]]; Li's daughter, [[Li Xiaolin]]; and, Li's younger son, Li Xiaoyong. Li Xiaoyong is married to Ye Xiaoyan, the daughter of Communist veteran [[Ye Ting]]'s second son, Ye Zhengming.

Li's family benefited from Li's high position during the 1980s and 1990s.  Two of Li's children, Li Xiaopeng and Li Xiaolin, inherited and ran two of China's electrical monopolies. State-run Chinese media have publicly questioned whether it is in China's long-term interest to preserve the &quot;new class of monopoly state capitalists&quot; that Li's family represents.&lt;ref&gt;Lam 1&lt;/ref&gt; Li Xiaopeng entered politics in [[Shanxi province]] and became its governor in 2012 and then in 2016, he became Minister of Transport. Li Xiaolin served as chief executive of [[China Power International Development]], before being transferred out in 2016 to a minor executive post at a different power company.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese democracy movement}}

The '''Tiananmen Square protests''' or the '''Tiananmen Square Incident''', commonly known as the '''June Fourth Incident''' ({{zh|s=六四事件|p=liùsì shìjiàn}}, literally the ''six-four incident'') in [[mainland China]], were student-led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] held in [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' ({{zh|s=八九民运|p=Bājiǔ mínyùn}}). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared [[martial law]] and sent the [[People's Liberation Army]] to occupy parts of central Beijing.

In what became known as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''' ({{zh|s=天安门大屠杀|p=Tiān'ānmén dà túshā}}), [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|troops]] armed with [[assault rifle]]s and accompanied by [[tank]]s fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.{{sfn|How Many Died|1990}}{{sfn|''Sino-American relations''|1991|p=445}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=154}}{{sfn|Kristof: Reassessing Casualties}}{{sfn|Richelson | Evans | 1999}}{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}

The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Communist general secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–89)|post-Mao China]], reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about one&amp;nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao |2001|p=171}}

As the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.{{sfn|Saich | 1990 | p=172}} By May, a student-led [[hunger strike]] galvanized support around the country for the demonstrators, and the protests spread to some 400 cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Ultimately, [[Deng Xiaoping]] and other [[Chinese Communist Party]] [[Eight Elders|elders]] believed the protests to be a political threat and resolved to use force.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}{{sfn|Declassified British cable}} On May 20, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] declared [[martial law]] and mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} The troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city's major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of June 4, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process.

The international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre.

Chinese conventionally date events by the name or number of the month and the day, followed by the type of event. Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown is &quot;June Fourth Incident&quot; ({{zh|c=六四事件 |p=liùsì shìjiàn}}). The nomenclature is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=六四运动 |p=liù-sì yùndòng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=八九民运 |p=bā-jiǔ mínyùn}}) are used to describe an event in its entirety.

The Chinese Communist Party has used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually using more neutral terminology.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events unfolded, it was labelled a &quot;[[Counter-revolutionary|counterrevolutionary]] riot&quot;, which was later changed to simply &quot;riot&quot;, followed by &quot;political storm&quot;. Finally the leadership settled on the more neutral phrase &quot;political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989&quot;, which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}

Outside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, the crackdown is commonly referred to in Chinese as &quot;June Fourth Massacre&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|t=六四屠殺 |p=liù-sì túshā}}) and &quot;June Fourth Crackdown&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|t=六四鎮壓 |p=liù-sì zhènyā}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too &quot;sensitive&quot; for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&amp;nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964 (i.e. yymd).&lt;ref name=&quot;HKFP8964&quot;&gt;''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in '8964' massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the terms &quot;Tiananmen Square Massacre&quot;, &quot;Tiananmen Square Protests&quot;, and &quot;Tiananmen Square Crackdown&quot; are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}

==Background==

=== ''Boluan Fanzheng'' and economic reforms ===
{{Main|Boluan Fanzheng|Chinese economic reform}}
{{History of the People's Republic of China}}

The [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]]. That movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself.

In September 1977, [[Deng Xiaoping]] proposed the idea of ''[[Boluan Fanzheng]]'' (&quot;bringing order out of chaos&quot;) to correct the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]], in December 1978, Deng emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. He launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]] ([[Reforms and Opening Up|Reforms and Opening-up]]). Within several years, the country's focus on ideological purity was replaced by a concerted attempt to achieve material prosperity.

To oversee his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980, and [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982.

===Challenges to Reforms and Opening-up===
Deng's reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually allow private production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had been de-collectivized and 80% of state-owned enterprises were permitted to retain their profits. Within a few years, production increased and poverty was substantially reduced.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

While the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems which the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] on the part of elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices fixed at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, price fluctuation allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats in charge of economic management had enormous incentives to engage in such [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public; and many, particularly intellectuals, began to believe that only democratic reform and the rule of law could cure the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|loc=Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}

Following the 1988 meeting at their summer retreat of [[Beidaihe]], the party leadership under Deng agreed to implement a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying, and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but there was a pronounced impact for much longer. Inflation soared: official indices reported that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased by 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600–01}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the &quot;[[iron rice bowl]]&quot;: i.e. social benefits such as job security, medical care, and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600–01}}

===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===
In 1978, reformist leaders envisioned that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state; and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in areas under their jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600–01}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the &quot;Democracy Salon&quot; ({{zh|s=民主沙龙|p=Mínzhǔ Shālóng}}) and the &quot;Lawn Salon&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|s=草坪沙龙|p=Cǎodì Shālóng}}), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}

At the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600–01}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor in success. There was widespread public disillusionment concerning the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define &quot;the correct path&quot; continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}

The comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (&quot;the right&quot;, led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (&quot;the left&quot;, led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}}

===1986 student demonstrations===
{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}

In mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour of universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and the [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wide undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of China's authoritarian political system and rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's ongoing problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated throughout the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}

In December 1986, inspired by Fang and other &quot;people-power&quot; movements around the world, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and the rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56–57}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing, and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.

General secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for showing a &quot;soft&quot; attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives, and was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. The party began the &quot;Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] campaign&quot;, taking aim at Hu, political liberalization, and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The campaign stopped student protests and restricted political activity, but Hu remained popular among intellectuals, students, and Communist Party progressives.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=138}}

In the first half of 1986, Deng repeatedly called for the revival of political reforms, as further economic reforms were hindered by the original political system with an increasing trend of [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|script-title=zh:邓小平为什么重提政治体制改革？|url=https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140224/cc24wuwei/|last1=Wu|first1=Wei|date=2014-03-18|website=New York Times|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030735/https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140224/cc24wuwei/|archive-date=October 21, 2019|access-date=2020-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|script-title=zh:鲍彤纪念六四，兼谈邓小平与中国的腐败|url=https://cn.nytimes.com/opinion/20150603/cc03bao/|last1=Bao|first1=Tong|date=2015-06-04|website=New York Times|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023030740/https://cn.nytimes.com/opinion/20150603/cc03bao/|archive-date=October 23, 2019|access-date=2020-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A five-man committee to study the feasibility of political reform was established in September 1986; the members included [[Zhao Ziyang]], [[Hu Qili]], [[Tian Jiyun]], [[Bo Yibo]] and [[Peng Chong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Yan|first1=Jiaqi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmRNTfW8UWkC&amp;q=Zhao+Ziyang,+Hu+Qili,+Tian+Jiyun,+Bo+Yibo+and+Peng+Chong&amp;pg=PA120|title=Toward a Democratic China: The Intellectual Autobiography of Yan Jiaqi|date=1992|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1501-1|language=en|access-date=September 30, 2020|archive-date=October 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001094815/https://books.google.com/books?id=SmRNTfW8UWkC&amp;q=Zhao+Ziyang%2C+Hu+Qili%2C+Tian+Jiyun%2C+Bo+Yibo+and+Peng+Chong&amp;pg=PA120|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=NING|first1=LOU|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bcl8jLxcXboC&amp;q=Zhao+Ziyang,+Hu+Qili,+Tian+Jiyun,+Bo+Yibo+and+Peng+Chong&amp;pg=PA143|title=Chinese Democracy and the Crisis of 1989: Chinese and American Reflections|date=1993-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1269-5|language=en|access-date=September 30, 2020|archive-date=October 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001094843/https://books.google.com/books?id=Bcl8jLxcXboC&amp;q=Zhao+Ziyang%2C+Hu+Qili%2C+Tian+Jiyun%2C+Bo+Yibo+and+Peng+Chong&amp;pg=PA143|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng's intention was to boost administrative efficiency, further separate responsibilities of the Party and the government, and eliminate bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|script-title=zh:赵紫阳与邓小平的两条政改路线|url=https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20141215/cc15wuwei41/|last1=Wu|first1=Wei|date=2014-12-15|website=New York Times|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030736/https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20141215/cc15wuwei41/|archive-date=October 21, 2019|access-date=2020-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|script-title=zh:邓小平谈不要照搬三权分立|url=https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140707/cc07wuwei19/|last1=Wu|first1=Wei|date=2014-07-07|website=New York Times|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216165803/https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20140707/cc07wuwei19/|archive-date=December 16, 2019|access-date=2020-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he spoke in terms of the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]], Deng delimited the reforms within the [[One-party state|one-party system]] and opposed the implementation of Western-style [[constitutionalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tiananmen 30 years on: A China that's averse to political reforms - for now|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/a-china-thats-averse-to-political-reforms-for-now|last=hermes|date=2019-06-04|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608041644/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/a-china-thats-averse-to-political-reforms-for-now|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on April 15, 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.{{sfn|Calhoun|1989}} Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.{{sfn|Pan | 2008 | p=274}} On university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for honoring Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were about broader political issues, such as corruption, democracy, and freedom of the press.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small, spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion.{{clarify|date=November 2020|reason=erected shrines before joining gathering in Tiananmen Square?}} Small, organized student gatherings also took place in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its wreath-laying ceremony was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&amp;nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds who gave public orations commemorating Hu and discussed social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.

Starting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (the Seven Demands) for the government:
# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.
# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.
# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.
# Allow privately-run newspapers and stop press censorship.
# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.
# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.
# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}

On the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. After police restrained the students from entering the compound, the students staged a [[sit-in]].

On April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. The incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Additionally, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1–2}}

Hu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and was attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, lasting only 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152–53}}{{sfn|Li|2010|loc=May 21 entry}}

Security cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]], and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as &quot;...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.&quot;{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as &quot;...in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.&quot;{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&amp;nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a classroom boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}

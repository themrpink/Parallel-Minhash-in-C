'''Communitarianism''' is a [[philosophy]] that emphasizes the connection between the [[individual]] and the [[community]]. Its overriding philosophy is based upon the belief that a person's social identity and personality are largely molded by community relationships, with a smaller degree of development being placed on individualism. Although the community might be a [[family]], communitarianism usually is understood, in the wider, philosophical sense, as a collection of interactions, among a community of people in a given place (geographical location), or among a community who share an interest or who share a history.&lt;ref&gt;Avineri, S.and de-Shalit, Avner. (1992) ''Communitarianism and Individualism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Communitarianism usually opposes extreme [[individualism]] and disagrees with extreme ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies that neglect the stability of the overall community.

== Terminology ==
The philosophy of communitarianism originated in the 20th century, but the term &quot;communitarian&quot; was coined in 1841, by [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], a leader of the British [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, who used it in referring to [[utopian socialists]] and other idealists who experimented with [[intentional community|communal styles of life]]. However, it was not until the 1980s that the term &quot;communitarianism&quot; gained currency through association with the work of a small group of political philosophers. Their application of the label &quot;communitarian&quot; was controversial, even among communitarians, because, in the West, the term evokes associations with the ideologies of [[socialism]] and [[collectivism]]; so, public leaders—and some of the academics who champion this school of thought—usually avoid the term &quot;communitarian&quot;, while still advocating and advancing the ideas of communitarianism.

The term is primarily used in two senses:
* '''Philosophical communitarianism''' considers [[classical liberalism]] to be [[ontologically]] and [[epistemologically]] incoherent, and opposes it on those grounds. Unlike classical liberalism, which construes communities as originating from the voluntary acts of pre-community [[individual]]s, it emphasizes the role of the community in defining and shaping individuals. Communitarians believe that the value of community is not sufficiently recognized in liberal theories of justice.
* '''Ideological communitarianism''' is characterized as a [[radical centrist]] [[ideology]] that is sometimes marked by leftism on economic issues and conservatism or centrism on social issues. This usage was coined recently. When the term is capitalized, it usually refers to the Responsive Communitarian movement of [[Amitai Etzioni]] and other philosophers.

Bratislava: VEDA, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1628-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; extend communitarianism to social projects tied to the values and significance of [[community]] or [[collectivism]] and to various types of [[communism]] and [[socialism]] (Christian, scientific, or utopian, including:
* Historical roots of collectivist projects from [[Plato]], through [[François-Noël Babeuf]], [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Robert Owen]] to [[Karl Marx]]
* Contemporary theoretical communitarianism ([[Michael J. Sandel]], [[Michael Walzer]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]), originating in the 1980s
** Pro-liberal, pro-multicultural (Walzer, Taylor)
** Anti-liberal, pro-national  (Sandel, MacIntyre)
* The vision of practical, self-sustaining communities as described by [[Thomas More]] (''Utopia''), [[Tommaso Campanella]] (''Civitas solis'') and practised by Christian Utopians ([[Jesuit Reduction]]) or utopian socialists like [[Charles Fourier]] ([[List of Fourierist Associations in the United States]]), [[Robert Owen]] ([[List of Owenite communities in the United States]]). This line includes various forms of [[cooperatives]], [[self-help]] instititutions, or communities ([[Hussite]] communities, [[The Diggers]], [[Habans]], [[Hutterites]], [[Amish]], Israeli [[kibbutz]], Slavic [[Občina|community]]; examples include the [[Twelve Tribes communities]], [[Tamera]] (Portugal), [[Marinaleda]] (Spain), the monastic state of [[Mount Athos]]&lt;ref&gt;PERNÝ, Lukáš. Lukáš Perný: Komunitarizmus ako alternatíva individualizmu. DAV DVA - kultúrno-politický magazín&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]).

== Origins ==
While the term communitarian was coined only in the mid-nineteenth century, ideas that are communitarian in nature appear much earlier. They are found in some classical socialist doctrine (e.g. writings about the early commune and about workers' solidarity), and further back in the [[New Testament]]. Communitarianism has been traced back to early [[monasticism]].

A number of early sociologists had strongly communitarian elements in their work, such as [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in his comparison of [[Gemeinschaft]] (oppressive but nurturing communities) and Gesellschaft (liberating but impersonal societies), and Emile Durkheim's concerns about the integrating role of social values and the relations between the individual and society. Both authors warned of the dangers of [[anomie]] (normlessness) and alienation in modern societies composed of atomized individuals who had gained their liberty but lost their social moorings.  Modern sociologists saw the rise of a mass society and the decline of communal bonds and respect for traditional values and authority in the United States as of the 1960s. Among those who raised these issues were Robert Nisbet (Twilight of Authority),&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert, Twilight of Authority. Indianapolis: LibertyFund, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert N. Bellah]] ''Habits of the Heart'',&lt;ref&gt;Bellah, Robert N., Habits of the Heart, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Ehrenhalt (The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenhalt Ehrenhalt, Alan, The Lost City: The Forgotten Virtues Of Community In America. New York:BasicBooks, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Bowling Alone (2000), Robert Putnam documented the decline of &quot;social capital&quot; and stressed the importance of &quot;bridging social capital,&quot; in which bonds of connectedness are formed across diverse social groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D., Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. New York:Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century communitarianism also began to be formulated as a philosophy by [[Dorothy Day]] and the [[Catholic Worker movement]]. In an early article the ''Catholic Worker'' clarified the dogma of the Mystical Body of Christ as the basis for the movement's communitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Walker [http://www.catholicworkeraustin.org/cw_movement.html &quot;The Catholic Worker Movement,&quot;] ''Mary House Catholic Worker of Austin''.  Retrieved 2019-12-13&lt;/ref&gt;  Along similar lines, communitarianism is also related to the [[personalist]] philosophy of [[Emmanuel Mounier]].

Responding to criticism that the term 'community' is too vague or cannot be defined, [[Amitai Etzioni]], one of the leaders of the American communitarian movement, pointed out that communities can be defined with reasonable precision as having two characteristics: first, a web of affect-laden relationships among a group of individuals, relationships that often crisscross and reinforce one another (as opposed to one-on-one or chain-like individual relationships); and second, a measure of commitment to a set of shared values, norms, and meanings, and a shared history and identity – in short, a particular culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Beckert, Jen. &quot;Communitarianism.&quot; International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology. London:Routledge, 2006. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, author David E. Pearson argued that &quot;[t]o earn the appellation 'community,' it seems to me, groups must be able to exert moral suasion and extract a measure of compliance from their members. That is, communities are necessarily, indeed, by definition, coercive as well as moral, threatening their members with the stick of sanctions if they stray, offering them the carrot of certainty and stability if they don't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

What is specifically meant by &quot;community&quot; in the context of communitarianism can vary greatly between authors and time periods. Historically, communities have been small and localized. However, as the reach of economic and technological forces extended, more-expansive communities became necessary in order to provide effective normative and political guidance to these forces, prompting the rise of national communities in Europe in the 17th century. Since the late 20th century there has been some growing recognition that the scope of even these communities is too limited, as many challenges that people now face, such as the threat of nuclear war and that of global environmental degradation and economic crises, cannot be handled on a national basis. This has led to the quest for more-encompassing communities, such as the [[European Union]]. Whether truly supra-national communities can be developed is far from clear.

More modern communities can take many different forms, but are often limited in scope and reach. For example, members of one residential community are often also members of other communities – such as work, ethnic, or religious ones. As a result, modern community members have multiple sources of attachments, and if one threatens to become overwhelming, individuals will often pull back and turn to another community for their attachments. Thus, communitarianism is the reaction of some intellectuals to the problems of Western society, an attempt to find flexible forms of balance between the individual and society, the autonomy of the individual and the interests of the community, between the common good and freedom, rights and duties.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Communitarian philosophy ==&lt;!-- Communitarian philosophy redirects here. --&gt;
In moral and political philosophy, communitarians are best known for their critiques of [[John Rawls]]' political liberalism, detailed at length in his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Communitarians criticize the image Rawls presents of humans as atomistic individuals, and stress that individuals who are well-integrated into communities are better able to reason and act in responsible ways than isolated individuals, but add that if social pressure to conform rises to high levels, it will undermine the individual self. Communitarians uphold the importance of the social realm, and communities in particular, though they differ in the extent to which their conceptions are attentive to liberty and individual rights. Even with these general similarities, communitarians, like members of many other schools of thought, differ considerably from one another. There are several distinct (and at times wildly divergent) schools of communitarian thought.

The following authors have communitarian tendencies in the philosophical sense, but have all taken pains to distance themselves from the political ideology known as communitarianism, which is discussed further below:
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]{{spaced ndash}}''[[After Virtue]]''
* [[Michael Sandel]]{{spaced ndash}}''[[Liberalism and the Limits of Justice]]''
* [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]{{spaced ndash}}''[[Sources of the Self]]''
* [[Michael Walzer]]{{spaced ndash}}''[[Spheres of Justice]]''

== Academic communitarianism ==&lt;!-- 'Academic communitarianism' redirects here. --&gt;
Whereas the classical liberalism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] can be viewed as a reaction to centuries of authoritarianism, oppressive government, overbearing communities, and rigid dogma, modern communitarianism can be considered a reaction to excessive individualism, understood as an undue emphasis on individual rights, leading people to become selfish or egocentric.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/communitarianism#ref299521|title=Communitarianism {{!}} political and social philosophy|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close relation between the individual and the community was discussed on a theoretical level by [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], among other academic communitarians, in their criticisms of philosophical liberalism, especially the work of the American liberal theorist [[John Rawls]] and that of the German Enlightenment philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. They argued that contemporary liberalism failed to account for the complex set of social relations that all individuals in the modern world are a part of. Liberalism is rooted in an untenable ontology that posits the existence of generic individuals and fails to account for social embeddedness. To the contrary, they argued, there are no generic individuals but rather only Germans or Russians, Berliners or Muscovites, or members of some other particularistic community. Because individual identity is partly constructed by culture and social relations, there is no coherent way of formulating individual rights or interests in abstraction from social contexts. Thus, according to these communitarians, there is no point in attempting to found a theory of justice on principles decided behind Rawls' [[veil of ignorance]], because individuals cannot exist in such an abstracted state, even in principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Academic communitarians also contend that the nature of the political community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively dangerous. Good societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures—they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.

In addition to Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, other thinkers sometimes associated with academic communitarianism include [[Michael Walzer]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Seyla Benhabib]], and [[Shlomo Avineri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Social capital ===
Beginning in the late 20th century, many authors began to observe a deterioration in the social networks of the United States. In the book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', [[Robert Putnam]] observed that nearly every form of civic organization has undergone drops in membership exemplified by the fact that, while more people are bowling than in the 1950s, there are fewer bowling leagues.

This results in a decline in &quot;[[social capital]]&quot;, described by Putnam as &quot;the collective value of all '[[social networks]]' and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other&quot;. According to Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Communitarians seek to bolster social capital and the institutions of [[civil society]]. The Responsive Communitarian Platform described it thus:&lt;ref name=&quot;platform&quot;&gt;The Communitarian Network, ''[http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html Responsive Communitarian Platform Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114032208/http://www.gwu.edu/~icps/RCP%20text.html |date=2010-01-14 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social goals require partnership between public and private groups. Though government should not seek to replace local communities, it may need to empower them by strategies of support, including revenue-sharing and technical assistance. There is a great need for study and experimentation with creative use of the structures of civil society, and public-private cooperation, especially where the delivery of health, educational and social services are concerned.

=== Positive rights ===
Important to some supporters of communitarian philosophy is the concept of [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], which are rights or guarantees to certain things. These may include state-subsidized education, state-subsidized housing, a safe and clean environment, universal health care, and even the right to a job with the concomitant obligation of the government or individuals to provide one. To this end, communitarians generally support social security programs, public works programs, and laws limiting such things as pollution.

A common objection is that by providing such rights, communitarians violate the [[negative and positive rights|negative rights]] of the citizens; rights to ''not'' have something done for you. For example, taxation to pay for such programs as described above dispossesses individuals of property. Proponents of positive rights, by attributing the protection of negative rights to the society rather than the government, respond that individuals would not have any rights in the absence of societies—a central tenet of communitarianism—and thus have a social responsibility to give something back to it. Some have viewed this as a negation of [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. However, what is or is not a &quot;natural right&quot; is a source of contention in modern politics, as well as historically; for example, whether or not universal health care, private property or protection from polluters can be considered a birthright.

The '''Kyzylkum Desert''' ({{lang-uz|Qizilqum, Қизилқум}}, قىزىلقۇم; {{lang-kk|Қызылқұм|Qyzylqum}}, قىزىلقۇم; {{lang-ru|Кызылкум}}) is the [[List of deserts by area|15th largest]] [[desert]] in the world. Its name means ''Red Sand'' in [[Turkic languages]]. It is located in [[Central Asia]] in the [[doab]] between the rivers [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]], a region historically known as [[Transoxania]] or [[Sogdiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Mapping Mongolia: Situating Mongolia in the World from Geologic Time to the Present, Paula L.W. Sabloff, P.62&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is divided between [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It covers about {{convert|298000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
The territory consists mainly of an extensive plain at an altitude up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], with a number of depressions and highlands (Sultanuizdag, Bukantau). Most of the area is covered with dunes ([[barchan]]s); in the northwest large areas are covered with [[takir]]s (clay coatings); there are also some oases. There are [[agriculture|agricultural]] settlements along the [[river]]s and in the [[oasis|oases]]. Temperatures can be very high during the summer months, from mid-May to mid-September. [[Kerki]], one extreme inland city located on the banks of the [[Amu Darya River]], recorded {{convert|52|C|F|abbr=on}} in July 1983. It is mainly located in Uzbekistan.

==Fauna==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Desert fauna include the [[Russian tortoise]] (''Testudo horsfieldii'') and a large lizard known as the Transcaspian or [[desert monitor]] (''Varanus griseus''), which can reach lengths of {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[saiga antelope]] (''Saiga tatarica'') also occasionally migrates through the northern part of the desert.

Kyzylkum Nature Reserve in [[Bukhara Province]] was established in 1971. The area of the reserve amounts to {{convert|101000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and it is located on flood-land ([[tugai]]) drained by the [[Amudarya]] close to the settlement [[Dargan Ata]]. Fauna include: [[Bactrian deer]] (''Cervus elaphus bactrianus''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), common pheasant (''Phasianus colchicus''), [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetus'').

Djeyran Reserve is located {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Bukhara]]. The total area of this reserve is {{convert|51450|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is a breeding centre for rare species such as [[goitered gazelle]] (''Gazella subgutturosa''), [[Przewalski's horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii''), [[Turkmenian kulan]] (''Equus hemionus kulan'') and [[MacQueen's bustard]] (''Chlamydotis macqueenii''). The reserve was founded in 1977 on the enclosed area in {{convert|5131|ha|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Paleontology==
[[File:Aral map.png|thumb|right|The Kyzylkum is between the Syr-Darya and Amu-Darya Rivers]]

The Kyzylkum Desert has exposed [[geologic formation|rock formations]] that have yielded a number of [[fossil]]s.  Of particular interest is the [[Bissekty Formation]] of Uzbekistan, from the early [[Late Cretaceous]], which has produced several species of early [[bird]]s: ''[[Incolornis]] martini'', ''[[Explorornis]] walkeri'', ''[[Kizylkumavis]] cretacea'', ''[[Kuszholia]] mengi'', ''[[Lenesornis]] kaskarovi'', ''[[Sazavis]] prisca'', ''[[Zhyraornis]] kaskarovi'' and ''Z. logunovi'' are recognized as valid species. [[Tyrannosauridae|Tyrannosaurid]], [[therizinosaur]]id, [[ornithomimosaur]], [[oviraptorosauria]]n, [[troodontidae|troodontid]], [[ankylosaur]], [[hadrosaur]], and [[ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]]s are also known from this rock unit.&lt;ref name=WETAL04&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weishampel |first1=David B. |author2=Paul M.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
The local population uses the large spaces of the Kyzylkum Desert as a pasture for livestock (mostly [[sheep]], [[Bactrian camel]]s and [[dromedary|dromedaries]]).

The desert is well known for its deposits of [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[copper]], [[aluminium]] and [[silver]], [[natural gas]] and oil. The development of the most famous [[Muruntau gold deposit|gold-field]] at [[Muruntau]] began in the early 1970s. The centres for the mining and smelting industry at the region are [[Navoi]], [[Zarafshan city]], [[Uchkuduk]]. The major industrial enterprises are: НГМК (Navoi Mining and Smelting Complex) and the Uzbek U.S.A. Joint Venture &quot;Zarafshan-Newmont&quot;. The centres of the gas-production industry are [[Gazli, Uzbekistan|Gazli]] and [[Mubarek]].

'''Atomic electron transition''' is a change of an [[electron]] from one [[energy level]] to another within an [[atom]]&lt;ref&gt;Schombert, James. [http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec08.html &quot;Quantum physics&quot;] University of Oregon Department of Physics&lt;/ref&gt; or [[artificial atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1009.2969|bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106k0502V|title = Observation of Quantum Jumps in a Superconducting Artificial Atom|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 106|issue = 11|pages = 110502|last1 = Vijay|first1 = R|last2 = Slichter|first2 = D. H|last3 = Siddiqi|first3 = I|year = 2011|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.110502|pmid = 21469850}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears discontinuous as the electron &quot;jumps&quot; from one [[energy level]] to another, typically in a few [[nanosecond]]s or less. It is also known as an '''electronic (de-)excitation''' or '''atomic transition''' or '''quantum jump'''.

Electron transitions cause the emission or absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of quantized units called [[photon]]s. Their statistics are [[Poisson distribution|Poissonian]], and the time between jumps is [[Exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mpq.mpg.de/Theorygroup/CIRAC/wiki/images/8/86/Samuel.pdf |last=Deléglise |first=S. |title=Observing the quantum jumps of light |access-date=September 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107043403/http://www.mpq.mpg.de/Theorygroup/CIRAC/wiki/images/8/86/Samuel.pdf |archive-date=November 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The damping time constant (which ranges from [[nanosecond]]s to a few seconds) relates to the natural, pressure, and field [[Spectral line#Line broadening and shift|broadening of spectral lines]]. The larger the energy separation of the states between which the electron jumps, the shorter the [[wavelength]] of the photon emitted.

The observability of quantum jumps was predicted by [[Hans Dehmelt]] in 1975, and they were first observed using [[Quadrupole ion trap|trapped ions]] of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] at [[NIST]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itano|first1=W. M.|last2=Bergquist|first2=J. C.|last3=Wineland|first3=D.

In 2019, it was demonstrated in an experiment with a superconducting [[artificial atom]] consisting of two strongly-hybridized [[Transmon|transmon qubits]] placed inside a readout resonator cavity at 15 mK, that the evolution of some jumps is continuous, coherent, [[determinism|deterministic]], and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Minev |first1=Z.

The '''Qattara Depression''' ({{lang-ar|منخفض القطارة}} ''Munḫafaḍ al-Qaṭṭārah'') is a [[depression (geology)|depression]] in northwestern [[Egypt]], specifically in the [[Matruh Governorate]]. The depression is part of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert of Egypt]]. 
The Qattara Depression lies below sea level, and its bottom is covered with [[salt pan (geology)|salt pans]], [[sand dunes]], and [[Inland salt marsh|salt marsh]]es. The depression extends between the latitudes of 28°35' and 30°25' north and the longitudes of 26°20' and 29°02' east.&lt;ref name=&quot;El Bassyony&quot;&gt;El Bassyony, Abdou. 1995. ''&quot;Introduction to the geology of the Qattara Depression,&quot;'' International Conference on the Studies and Achievements of Geosciences in Egypt, 69 (85-eoa)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qattara Depression was created by the interplay of salt weathering and wind erosion. Some 20 kilometres west of the depression lie the oases of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa in Egypt]] and [[Jaghbub, Libya|Jaghbub in Libya]] in smaller but similar depressions.

The Qattara Depression contains the second lowest point in Africa at an elevation of {{convert|133|m|ft}} below sea level, the lowest point being [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] in Djibouti. The depression covers about {{convert|19605|km2|sqmi}}, a size comparable with [[Lake Ontario]] or twice as large as [[Lebanon]]. Due to its size and proximity to the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], studies have been made for the potential to generate [[hydroelectricity]] here.

==Geography==
[[File:The Qattara Depression, Egypt, Matruh Governate.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Map of the Qattara Depression.&lt;br/&gt; Lower left bound: 28°36'30.74&quot;N 26°14'31.08&quot;E.&lt;br/&gt; Upper right bound: 30°31'1.74&quot;N 29° 8'51.83&quot;E.]]

Egyptians believe the Qattara Depression has the shape of a teardrop, with its point facing east and the broad deep area facing southwest. The northern side of the depression is characterised by steep escarpments up to 280 meters high, marking the edge of the adjacent El Diffa plateau. To the south the depression slopes gently up to the [[Egyptian Sand Sea|Great Sand Sea]].

Within the Depression are [[salt marsh]]es, under the northwestern and northern [[escarpment]] edges, and extensive [[dry lake]] beds that flood occasionally. The marshes occupy approximately {{convert|300|km2|sqmi}}, although wind-blown sands are encroaching in some areas. About a quarter of the region is occupied by dry lakes composed of hard crust and sticky mud, and occasionally filled with water.

The depression was initiated by either wind or fluvial erosion in the late [[Neogene]], but during the [[Quaternary Period]] the dominant mechanism was a combination of [[Weathering#Salt-crystal growth|salt weathering]] and [[Erosion#Wind|wind erosion]] working together. First, the salts break up the depression floor, then the wind blows away the resulting sands. This process is less effective in the eastern part of the depression, due to lower salinity groundwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geomorphology&quot;&gt;Aref M.A.M., El-Khoriby E., Hamdan M.A. 15 June 2002.

Groves of umbrella thorn acacia (''[[Vachellia tortilis]]''), growing in shallow sandy depressions, and ''[[Phragmites]]'' swamps represent the only permanent vegetation. The acacia groves vary widely in [[biodiversity]] and rely on runoff from rainfall and groundwater to survive. The [[Moghra Oasis]] in the northeastern part of the Depression has a four&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brackish lake and a ''Phragmites'' swamp.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, R. H. and J. S.

The southwestern corner of the depression is part of the [[Siwa Protected Area]] which protects the wild oasis in and around the [[Siwa Oasis]].

The Depression is an important habitat for the [[cheetah]], with the largest number of recent sightings being in areas in the northern, western and northwestern part of the Qattara Depression, including the highly isolated, wild oases of Ain EI Qattara and Ein EI Ghazzalat and numerous acacia groves both inside and outside the depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheetah&quot;&gt;Saleh, M.A., Helmy, I. and Giegengack. 2001. ''The Cheetah, &quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot; (Schreber, 1776) in Egypt (Felidae, Acinonychinae)''. &quot;Mammalia&quot; 65 (2): 177–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gazelle]]s (''Gazella dorcas'' and ''Gazella leptoceros'') also inhabit the Qattara Depression, being an important food source for the cheetah. The largest gazelle population exists in the southwestern part of the Qattara Depression within a vast area of [[wetlands]] and soft sand. The area of {{convert|900|km2|sqmi}}, includes the wild oases of Hatiyat Tabaghbagh and Hatiyat Umm Kitabain, and is a mosaic of [[lake]]s, [[salt marsh]]es, [[scrubland]], wild [[Arecaceae|palm]] groves and ''[[Desmostachya bipinnata]]'' [[grassland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheetah&quot; /&gt;

Other common fauna include the [[Cape hare]] (''Lepus capensis''), [[golden jackal|Egyptian jackal]] (''Canis aureus hupstar''), [[Rüppell's fox|sand fox]] (''Vulpes rueppelli'') and more rarely the [[fennec fox]] (''Vulpes zerda''). [[Barbary sheep]] (''Ammotragus lervia'') were once common here but now they are few in numbers.

Extinct species from the area include the [[scimitar oryx]] (''Oryx dammah''), [[addax]] (''Addax nasomaculatus'') and [[bubal hartebeest]] (''Alcelaphus buselaphus'').&lt;ref&gt;Manlius, M., Menardi-Noguera, A. and Andras Zboray, A. 2003.

(London) 259: 403–409.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the ''[[Droseridites]] baculatus'', an extinct plant known only from fossils of its pollen, was found at the [[Ghazalat-1 Well]].&lt;ref name=Ibrahim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibrahim | first1 = M.I.A. | year = 1996 | title = Aptian-Turonian palynology of the Ghazalat-1 Well (GTX-1), Qattara Depression, Egypt | journal = Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology | volume = 94 | issue = 1–2| pages = 137–168 | doi = 10.1016/0034-6667(95)00135-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

The climate of the Qattara Depression is highly [[wiktionary:arid|arid]] with annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] between 25 and 50&amp;nbsp;mm on the northern rim to less than 25&amp;nbsp;mm in the south of the depression. The average daily temperature varies between {{convert|36.2|to|6.2|C|F}} during summer and winter months. The prevailing wind forms a largely bimodal regime with most wind coming from north easterly and westerly directions. This causes the linear dune formations in the Western desert between the Qattara Depression and the Nile valley. Wind speeds peak in March at {{cvt|11.5|m/s|mph}} and minimal in December at {{cvt|3.2|m/s|mph}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geomorphology&quot;/&gt;
The average wind speed is about {{cvt|5|–|6|m/s|mph}}.&lt;ref name=windatlas&gt;Mortensen, N. G.; Said, U.S.; Badger, J. (2006). ''Wind Atlas for Egypt: Measurements, Micro- and Mesoscale Modeling''. New and Renewable Energy Authority, Cairo, Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; Several days each year in the months March to May [[khamsin|khamsin winds]] blow in from the south and bringing extremely high temperatures as well as sand and dust with them.

==Land use==
There is one permanent settlement in the Qattara Depression, the [[Qara Oasis]]. The oasis is located in the westernmost part of the depression and is inhabited by about 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;Kjeilen, Tore [http://looklex.com/egypt/qara.htm ''Looklex report on the Qara oasis''], date unknown&lt;/ref&gt; The Depression is also inhabited by the nomadic [[Bedouin]] people and their flocks, with the uninhabited Moghra oasis being important in times of [[water scarcity]] during the dry seasons.

The Qattara Depression contains many oil concessions, and several operational [[oil field]]s. The drilling companies include [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and the [[Apache Corporation]].

==History==

=== Measurement ===
The elevation of the depression was first measured in 1917 by an officer of the British Army leading a light car patrol into the region. The officer took readings of the height of the terrain with an [[barometer|aneroid barometer]] on behalf of [[John Ball (geologist)|John Ball]], who later would also publish on the region. He discovered that the spring Ain EI Qattara lay about {{convert|60|m|ft}} below sea level. Because the barometer got lost and the readings were so unexpected, this find had to be verified. During 1924–25, Ball again organised a survey party, this time with the sole purpose to [[triangulate]] the elevation on a westerly line from [[Wadi El Natrun]]. The survey was led by G.F. Walpole who had already distinguished himself by triangulating the terrain across {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Nile]] to [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] via [[Bahariya]]. He confirmed the earlier readings and proved the presence of a huge area below sea level, with places as deep as {{convert|-133|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;El Bassyony&quot; /&gt;

Knowledge about the geology of the Qattara Depression was greatly extended by [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], a British military commander and explorer, through numerous journeys in the 1920s and 1930s. Most notable was his 1927 journey during which he crossed the depression east to west and visited the oases of [[Qara Oasis|Qara]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. Many of these trips used motor vehicles (Ford Model-Ts) which used special techniques for driving in desert conditions. These techniques were an important asset of the [[Long Range Desert Group]] which Bagnold founded in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnold1&quot;&gt;Bagnold, R.A. 1931. &quot;Journeys in the Libyan Desert, 1929 and 1930&quot;. ''The Geographical Journal'' 78(1): 13-39; (6):524-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of the depression, Ball published the triangulation findings about the region in October 1927 in ''[[The Geographical Journal]]''. He also gave the region its name &quot;Qattara&quot; after the spring Ain EI Qattara where the first readings were taken. The name literally means &quot;dripping&quot; in Arabic. Six years later in 1933, Ball was the first to publish a proposal for flooding the region to generate hydroelectric power in his article &quot;The Qattara Depression of the Libyan Desert and the possibility of its utilisation for power-production&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;El Bassyony&quot; /&gt;

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], the depression's presence shaped the [[First Battle of El Alamein|1st]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|2nd Battles of El Alamein]]. It was considered impassable by [[tank]]s and most other [[military]] [[vehicle]]s because of features such as salt lakes, high cliffs and/or escarpments, and [[fech fech]] (very fine powdered sand). The cliffs in particular acted as an edge of the El Alamein battlefield, which meant the [[British Empire]]'s forces could not be [[flanking manoeuvre|outflanked]] to the south. Both Axis and Allied forces built their defences in a line from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the Qattara Depression. These defences became known as the [[Devil's gardens]], and they are for the most part still there, especially the extensive minefields.

No large army units entered the Depression, although German [[Afrika Korps]] patrols and the British [[Long Range Desert Group]] did operate in the area, since these small units had considerable experience in desert travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagnold1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. (2003). ''Rommel's panzers: Rommel and the Panzer forces of the Blitzkrieg, 1940–1942'' (pp. 78–79). St. Paul, MN: MBI.&lt;/ref&gt; The RAF's repair and salvage units (e.g. 58 RSU) used a route through the depression to salvage or recover [[aircraft]] that had landed or crashed in the Western desert away from the coastal plain.

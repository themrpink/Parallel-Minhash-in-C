=== Public transport ===
Porto Torres belong to the metropolitan network of north Sardinia (lit. &quot;Rete metropolitana del nord Sardegna&quot;). Due to this, the city is well-connected with all nearly towns via intercity autobus thanks to the [[ARST (company)|ARST]]. Local rides are managed by the local public transport agency (''A.t.p. Sassari'').

== Education ==

=== School ===
[[File:Istituto tecnico nautico Porto Torres.jpg|thumb|[[Secondary school|High school]] &quot;M.Paglietti&quot;]]
The town has many state [[Secondary school|high-schools]] and several state [[primary school]]s in its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Scuole dell'obbligo a Porto Torres|url=https://www.comune.porto-torres.ss.it/Servizi/Servizi-al-cittadino/Educazione-e-scuola/Scuole-dellobbligo-a-Porto-Torres|url-status=live|access-date=2020-04-06|website=Comune di Porto Torres|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Liceo Scientifico &quot;Europa Unita&quot;|url=https://www.iispaglietti.edu.it/index.php/l-istituto/la-scuola/i-licei/liceo-di-porto-torres|url-status=live|access-date=2020-04-06|website=www.iispaglietti.edu.it|language=it-it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the urban territory there is also a [[music school]] named in memory of the Italian songwriter [[Fabrizio De André|Fabrizio de Andrè]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comune.porto-torres.ss.it/Servizi/Servizi-al-cittadino/Scuola-Civica-di-Musica-Fabrizio-De-Andre|title=Scuola Civica di Musica|last=Torres|first=Comune di Porto|website=Comune di Porto Torres|language=it|access-date=2020-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proximity to the city of [[Sassari]] and thanks to the intercity lines managed by [[ARST (company)|ARST]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ARST - - Servizi extraurbani TPL|url=http://arst.sardegna.it/orari_e_autolinee/Servizi_extraurbani.html|url-status=live|access-date=2020-04-06|website=arst.sardegna.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the citizens is very easy to reach the near [[University of Sassari]].

'''Alghero''' ({{IPA-it|alˈɡɛːro}}), also known in the local [[Algherese dialect]] as '''L'Alguer''' ({{IPA-ca|ləlˈɣe}}; {{lang-sc|S'Alighèra}}; {{lang-sdc|L'Aliera}}), is a town of about 45,000 inhabitants in the [[Italy|Italian]] insular [[province of Sassari]] in northwestern [[Sardinia]], next to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Part of its population descends from [[Catalans|Catalan]] conquerors from the end of the Middle Ages, when Sardinia was part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Hence, the [[Catalan language]] is co-official (a unique situation in Italy) and known as the [[Alguerès]] dialect. The name Alghero comes from ''Aleguerium'', which is a mediaeval [[Latin]] word meaning &quot;stagnation of algae&quot; (''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carrentalinsardinia.com/algherocityguide.html|title=Alghero city guide, Sardinia - Visit and explore Alghero|website=www.carrentalinsardinia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alghero is the third university center in the island, coming after [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]]. It hosts the headquarters of the [[University of Sassari|Università degli Studi di Sassari]]’s Architecture and Design department. In 2012 it was the 10th most visited city by tourists in Italy. {{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

[[File:Nuraghe near Alghero.JPG|thumb|left|[[Nuraghe Palmavera]] near Alghero.]]

The area of today's Alghero has been settled since pre-historic times. The [[Ozieri|Ozieri culture]] was present here in the 4th millennium BC ([[Necropolis of Anghelu Ruju]]), while the [[Nuraghe]] civilization settled in the area around 1,500 BC.

The [[Phoenicians]] arrived by the 8th century BC and the [[metalworking]] town of Sant'Imbenia&amp;nbsp;– in the area of later Alghero&amp;nbsp;–, with a mixed Phoenician and [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic]] population, engaged in trade with the [[Etruscans]] on the Italian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Richard |date=2010 |title=Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization |location=United States |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=42–43 |isbn=978-0-14-312129-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its strategic position on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Alghero had been developed into a fortified port town by 1102, built by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[Doria (family)|Doria]] family. The Dorias ruled Alghero for centuries, apart from a brief period under the rule of [[Pisa]] between 1283 and 1284.  Alghero's population later grew because of the arrival of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] colonists. In the early 16th century Alghero received papal recognition as a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alghero-Bosa|bishopric]] and the status of King's City (''ciutat de l'Alguer'') and developed economically.

[[File:Piazza Sulis Alghero.jpg|thumb|Sulis Tower]]

Historically, the city was founded in the early twelfth century between 1102 and 1112, when the noble [[Doria (family)|Doria family]] of [[Genoa]] was allowed to build the first historical nucleus into an empty section of the coast of the [[parish]] of Nulauro in [[Judiciary|Judicature]] of Torres ([[Sassari]]). For two centuries it remained in the orbit of the [[Maritime republics|Maritime Republics]], first and foremost the Genoese, apart from 1283–1284 when the [[Pisa]]ns were able to control it for a year. It is plausible that at this time the town shared, given its commercial and multi-ethnic nature, a language similar to the nascent [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]].

[[File:Alghero - Chiesa di San Francesco (15).JPG|thumb|San Francesco Church]]
[[File:Alghero - Piazza Civica (01).JPG|thumb|Civic Square]]
 		
The village was conquered by force by the [[Crown of Aragon]], at the behest of [[Peter IV of Aragon|King Pere IV of Aragon]] (r. 1336–1387), who later actively promoted colonisation of the town and the surrounding area, sending numerous families from different counties and provinces of the then Crown of Aragon, including [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]. These were granted enticing privileges, and in fact, replaced the original population some of whom were sent to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Majorca as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prosodia.upf.edu/coalgueres/en/algueres.html|title=Corpus Oral de l'Alguerès|website=prosodia.upf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects these families spoke in Alghero, were all very similar and derived from the same linguistic family. Over time it settled on its current form of Catalan, despite the subsequent decline of the Crown of Aragon.

The Aragonese were followed by the Spanish [[Habsburg]]s, who ruled until 1702 and continued expanding the town.
 
In 1720 Alghero, along with the rest of Sardinia, was handed over to the [[Piedmont]]-based [[House of Savoy]], upon the arrival of which a policy of [[Italianization]] was commenced. In 1821, a famine led to a revolt by the population, which was bloodily suppressed. At the end of the same century, Alghero was de-militarised.

During the [[Fascism|Fascist]] era, part of the surrounding marshes were reclaimed and the suburbs of Fertilia and S.M. La Palma were founded. During [[World War II]] (1943), Alghero was bombed, and its historical centre suffered heavy damage. The presence of [[malaria]] in the countryside was finally overcome in the 1950s.

Since then, Alghero has become a popular tourist resort.

==Geography==
===Location===
Alghero is located in the northwestern coast of Sardinia, along the bay named after the city. In the north of the urban area, there is the Nurra plain; to the northwest, the karstic systems of Capo Caccia, Punta Giglio and Monte Doglia. The south is built mainly by mountains and the plateaus of [[Villanova Monteleone]] and [[Bosa]].

===Climate===
The climate at Alghero is mild due to the presence of the sea, which attenuates the temperatures especially during the summer. Summers are warm like in most parts of the Mediterranean. Winters are also tempered, with the thermometers showing negative Celsius temperatures just a few days per year.

[[File:Mapa dialectal del català.png|thumb|right|Map of the Catalan dialects.]]
 
A dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is [[Algherese dialect|spoken in Alghero]], introduced when Catalans settled in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sardegnacultura.it/j/v/258?s=20218&amp;v=2&amp;c=2706&amp;t=7|title=Sardegna Cultura - Lingua sarda - Il sardo - Altre lingue|website=www.sardegnacultura.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan was replaced as the official language of the Island by Spanish in the 17th century, then by Italian. The most recent linguistic research showed that 24.1% of the people have [[Algherese|Algherese Catalan]] as a mother tongue, which is habitually spoken by 18.5% and taught to the children by 8% of the population, whereas 88.2% have some understanding of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anthonymuroni.it/2017/05/11/agli-algheresi-piace-parlare-catalano-ora-vorrebbero-si-insegnasse-scuola/ |title=Agli algheresi piace parlare catalano, ora vorrebbero si insegnasse a scuola |last=Muroni |first=Anthony |date=11 May 2017 |website=www.anthonymuroni.it |trans-title=Algheresi like to speak Catalan, now they would like to be taught at school}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/alghero/cronaca/2017/05/13/news/gli-algheresi-vogliono-il-catalano-a-scuola-1.15332489 |title=Gli algheresi vogliono il catalano a scuola |date=2017-05-13 |work=La Nuova Sardegna |language=it |trans-title=Algherese want Catalan at school}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, Catalan has had official recognition and national and regional laws grant its right to be used in the city. Currently, there has been a revival of the arts in Algherese Catalan, with singers such as [[Franca Masu]] performing original compositions in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Songs in Algherese available on official website [http://www.francamasu.com francamasu.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305032148/http://www.francamasu.com/ |date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a rural exodus from the surrounding villages towards the city, much of the population speaks or has some proficiency in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], in addition to Italian and Catalan. Historically, the spread of Catalan was limited to the city and part of the coast, as the surrounding countryside has always been populated by Sardinian-speaking people.

Moreover, the ancient part of Alghero shows many characteristics of Catalan medieval architecture. The ‘algueresos’ (Alghero inhabitants) usually refer to their city as ‘Barceloneta’ – 'little [[Barcelona]]' – because of their ancestry and fraternity with the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] capital. Also the cuisine is a blending of [[Catalan cuisine]] and [[Sardinian cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.portodialghero.com/en/culture.html |title=Alghero History and Culture |website=www.portodialghero.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main sights==
[[File:Sardinia - 78 - aga - 2015.jpg|thumb|Alghero Lungomare]]

The many historical dominances that occurred in Alghero have created a rich variety of monuments, buildings and sights. Back from the Neolithic period from which many settlements remain, up to nowadays, in the last decades Alghero has become a touristic main point not only because of its coast and natural beauties but also because of a fairly well-preserved patrimony.

===Archeological sites===
Several archeological sites out of the urban area: the [[Necropolis of Anghelu Ruju|Anghelu Ruju necropolis]], the Santu Pedru hill, the Villa Romana of Santa Imbenia or even the Purissima. Many nuraghi in some other points as Palmavera are also well preserved and open to visitors.

===Ramparts===
The first ramparts system looks back to the 13th century and was imported from the [[Genoa|Genovese]] system. In 1354 the city was occupied by Catalans, who restored and expanded the defensive system, back then in bad condition. Some features from the old walls were respected, but [[Ferdinand the Catholic]], who wanted to grant more protection to the city, built the majority of them in the 16th Century. Along the walls, 7 towers and 3 forts are found.

===Religious architecture===
[[File:Alghero Dom Kuppel1.jpg|thumb|Sant Miquel's Dome]]

* [[Alghero Cathedral]] (''Cattedrale di Santa Maria Immacolata di Alghero'') is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alghero-Bosa]] (initially bishopric of Alghero). Construction started in 1570, and although it was opened in 1593, it was not until 1730 until it was finished and consecrated. The original church was in the Catalan-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, as can be seen in the five chapels of the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], which also include the base of the bell tower. The nave and the two aisles are of late Renaissance style. In the 20th century a Neo-Classical [[narthex]] was added to the façade, radically altering its appearance.
* The church of St. Francis (1360, rebuilt in the late 16th century). Original Catalan-Gothic parts can be seen over the high altar, the presbytery chapels and the San Sacramento Chapel. The bell tower is from the first half of the 16th century.
* The church of St. Michael.
* The ''Madonna del Santo Rosario''.

===Others===

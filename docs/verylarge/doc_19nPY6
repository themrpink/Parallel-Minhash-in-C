The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting [[red giant]] formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;Harpaz, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e;&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 173–78&lt;/ref&gt; while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave behind the inert core in the form of a [[white dwarf]]. The ejection of the outer layers forms a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 111–18&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant of a supernova is a dense [[neutron star]], or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge atlas&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor= Audouze, Jean|editor2= Israel, Guy|title=The Cambridge Atlas of Astronomy|edition=3rd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-521-43438-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 189–210&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the &quot;[[metallicity|metals]]&quot; produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, 1994, pp. 245–56&lt;/ref&gt;

At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the [[Sun]], a typical main-sequence [[dwarf star]] of [[stellar class]] G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a [[variable star]], but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the [[sunspot cycle]]. This is an 11-year oscillation in [[Wolf number|sunspot number]]. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;solar FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-solar.html|title=The Solar FAQ|last=Johansson|first=Sverker|author-link=Sverker Johansson|date=27 July 2003|publisher=Talk.Origins Archive|access-date=11 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907235636/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-solar.html|archive-date=7 September 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Environmental issues : essential primary sources.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v3=1&amp;DB=local&amp;CMD=010a+2006000857&amp;CNT=10+records+per+page|title=Environmental issues : essential primary sources|last1=Lerner|first1=K.

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated [[solar corona|corona]].

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the [[convection zone]] where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.&lt;ref name=&quot;solar FAQ&quot; /&gt;

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]]. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] ([[magnetosphere]]) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s that envelop the Earth. The [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines then descend into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Stern, D.P.|author2 = Peredo, M.|date = 28 September 2004|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html|title = The Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere|publisher = NASA|access-date =22 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060824003619/http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html| archive-date= 24 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetary science is the study of the assemblage of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The [[Solar System]] has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of the Sun's planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://marswatch.tn.cornell.edu/rsm.html|title=Remote Sensing for the Earth Sciences: Manual of Remote Sensing|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd|author=Bell III, J.

The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the [[asteroid belt]], and the outer planets. The inner [[terrestrial planet]]s consist of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Earth, and [[Mars]]. The outer [[gas giant]] planets are [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;planets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author = Grayzeck, E.|author2 = Williams, D.R.| date = 11 May 2006|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/|title = Lunar and Planetary Science|publisher = NASA|access-date =21 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820173205/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/| archive-date= 20 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Neptune lies the [[Kuiper belt]], and finally the [[Oort Cloud]], which may extend as far as a light-year.

The planets were formed 4.6 billion years ago in the [[protoplanetary disk]] that surrounded the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the [[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have [[giant impact hypothesis|formed the Moon]].&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montmerle|first=Thierry|author2=Augereau, Jean-Charles|author3= Chaussidon, Marc|title=Solar System Formation and Early Evolution: the First 100 Million Years|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=98|issue=1–4|pages=39–95|date=2006|doi=10.1007/s11038-006-9087-5| bibcode=2006EM&amp;P...98...39M|s2cid=120504344|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities segregate within, during [[planetary differentiation]]. This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust. The core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores generate their own [[magnetic field]], which can protect their atmospheres from solar wind stripping.&lt;ref&gt;Montmerle, 2006, pp. 87–90&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that created the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (''e.g.'' [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[Aluminium#Isotopes|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]]), or [[tidal acceleration|tidal heating]] caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as [[volcanism]] and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an [[atmosphere]] can also undergo surface [[erosion]] from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.&lt;ref name=&quot;new solar system&quot;&gt;{{cite book| editor=Beatty, J.K.| editor2=Petersen, C.C.| editor3=Chaikin, A.|title=The New Solar System|publisher=Cambridge press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOezyHMVAMcC&amp;pg=PA70|page=70edition = 4th|date=1999|isbn =978-0-521-64587-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. [[Archaeoastronomy]] is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] evidence. [[Astrobiology]] is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. [[Astrostatistics]] is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.

The study of [[chemical]]s found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called [[astrochemistry]]. These substances are usually found in [[molecular cloud]]s, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. [[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios. Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As &quot;[[forensic astronomy]]&quot;, finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history.

==Amateur astronomy==
[[File:Telescope trailer 22.jpg|upright|thumb|Amateur astronomers can build their own equipment, and hold star parties and gatherings, such as [[Stellafane]].]]
{{Main|Amateur astronomy}}

Astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last = Mims III|first = Forrest M.
|title=Amateur Science—Strong Tradition, Bright Future

|quote=Astronomy has traditionally been among the most fertile fields for serious amateurs [...]
|bibcode = 1999Sci...284...55M |s2cid = 162370774
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with [[Amateur telescope making|equipment that they build themselves]]. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsmeteors.org/|title = The American Meteor Society|access-date =24 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060822135040/http://www.amsmeteors.org/| archive-date= 22 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jerry|last=Lodriguss|url=http://www.astropix.com/|title = Catching the Light: Astrophotography|access-date =24 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060901185541/http://www.astropix.com/| archive-date= 1 September 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]], who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (''e.g.'' the [[One-Mile Telescope]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ghigo, F.|date = 7 February 2006|url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml|title = Karl Jansky and the Discovery of Cosmic Radio Waves|publisher = National Radio Astronomy Observatory|access-date =24 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831105945/http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_jansky.shtml| archive-date= 31 August 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~arcus/cara/|title = Cambridge Amateur Radio Astronomers|access-date =24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm| title= The International Occultation Timing Association| access-date= 24 August 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060821180723/http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm| archive-date= 21 August 2006| url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |title=Edgar Wilson Award |publisher=IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams |access-date=24 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024202325/http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/special/EdgarWilson.html |archive-date=24 October 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/|title = American Association of Variable Star Observers|publisher = AAVSO|access-date =3 February 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100202050715/http://www.aavso.org/| archive-date= 2 February 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.

      <text bytes="27295" xml:space="preserve">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], '''uniform convergence''' is a [[Modes of convergence|mode]] of [[Limit of a sequence|convergence]] of functions stronger than [[pointwise convergence]]. A [[sequence]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges uniformly''' to a limiting function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if, given any arbitrarily small positive number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, a number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that each of the functions &lt;math&gt;f_N, f_{N+1},f_{N+2},\ldots&lt;/math&gt; differ from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by no more than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; ''at every point'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''in'' &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.  Described in an informal way, if &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; uniformly, then the rate at which &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;uniform&quot; throughout its domain in the following sense: in order to determine how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; needs to be to guarantee that &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; falls within a certain distance &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we do not need to know the value of &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt; in question — there is a single value of &lt;math&gt;N=N(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; ''independent of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'', such that choosing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to be larger than &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; will suffice. 

The difference between uniform convergence and pointwise convergence was not fully appreciated early in the history of calculus, leading to instances of faulty reasoning.  The concept, which was first formalized by [[Karl Weierstrass]], is important because several properties of the functions &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrability]], and, with additional hypotheses, [[differentiability]], are transferred to the [[limit of a function|limit]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if the convergence is uniform, but not necessarily if the convergence is not uniform.

== History ==

In 1821 [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]  published a proof that a convergent sum of continuous functions is always continuous, to which [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1826 found purported counterexamples in the context of [[Fourier series]], arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect.  Completely standard notions of convergence did not exist at the time, and Cauchy handled convergence using infinitesimal methods.  When put into the modern language, what Cauchy proved is that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit. The failure of a merely pointwise-convergent limit of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function illustrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of convergence when handling sequences of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.hm.2004.11.010 | volume=32 | issue=4 | title=Exceptions and counterexamples: Understanding Abel's comment on Cauchy's Theorem | journal=Historia Mathematica | pages=453–480| year=2005 | last1=Sørensen | first1=Henrik Kragh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term uniform convergence was probably first used by [[Christoph Gudermann]], in an 1838 paper on [[elliptic functions]], where he employed the phrase &quot;convergence in a uniform way&quot; when the &quot;mode of convergence&quot; of a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x,\phi,\psi)}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the variables &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi.&lt;/math&gt; While he thought it a &quot;remarkable fact&quot; when a series converged in this way, he did not give a formal definition, nor use the property in any of his proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Later Gudermann's pupil [[Karl Weierstrass]], who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839–1840, coined the term ''gleichmäßig konvergent'' ({{lang-de|uniformly convergent}}) which he used in his 1841 paper ''Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen'', published in 1894. Independently, similar concepts were articulated by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lakatos |first=Imre |authorlink=Imre Lakatos |title=Proofs and Refutations|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/proofsrefutation0000laka/page/141 141] |isbn=978-0-521-21078-2|title-link=Proofs and Refutations }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Gabriel Stokes]].  [[G. H. Hardy]] compares the three definitions in his paper &quot;Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence&quot; and remarks: &quot;Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis.&quot;

Under the influence of Weierstrass and [[Bernhard Riemann]] this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by [[Hermann Hankel]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Ulisse Dini]], [[Cesare Arzelà]] and others.

== Definition ==

We first define uniform convergence for [[Real-valued function|real-valued functions]], although the concept is readily generalized to functions mapping to [[Metric space|metric spaces]] and, more generally, [[Uniform space|uniform spaces]] (see [[Uniform convergence#Generalizations|below]]). 

Suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of real-valued functions on it. We say the sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; is '''uniformly convergent''' on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; with limit &lt;math&gt;f: E \to \R&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The notation for uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not quite standardized and different authors have used a variety of symbols, including (in roughly decreasing order of popularity): 

:&lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f, \quad \underset{n\to\infty}{\mathrm{unif\ lim}}f_n = f, \quad f_n \overset{\mathrm{unif.}}{\longrightarrow} f.&lt;/math&gt; 

Frequently, no special symbol is used, and authors simply write 

:&lt;math&gt;f_n\to f \quad \mathrm{uniformly}&lt;/math&gt; 

to indicate that convergence is uniform. (In contrast, the expression &lt;math&gt;f_n\to f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; without an adverb is taken to mean [[pointwise convergence]] on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;: for all &lt;math&gt; x \in E &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)\to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

Since &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complete metric space]], the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]] can be used to give an equivalent alternative formulation for uniform convergence: &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n\in\N}&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (in the previous sense) if and only if for every &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;x\in E, m,n\geq N \implies |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

In yet another equivalent formulation, if we define 

:&lt;math&gt; d_n = \sup_{x\in E} |f_n(x) - f(x) |,&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt; f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; uniformly if and only if &lt;math&gt;d_n\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can characterize uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; as (simple) convergence of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[function space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^E&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''[[Uniform norm|uniform metric]]'' (also called the supremum metric), defined by 

:&lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=\sup_{x\in E} |f(x)-g(x)|.&lt;/math&gt;

Symbolically, 

:&lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f\iff \lim_{n\to\infty} d(f_n,f)= 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \N}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''locally uniformly convergent''' with limit &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;E &lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] and for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;B(x,r)\cap E.&lt;/math&gt; It is clear that uniform convergence implies local uniform convergence, which implies pointwise convergence.

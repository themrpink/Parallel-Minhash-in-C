Newman was an auto racing enthusiast, and first became interested in motorsports (&quot;the first thing that I ever found I had any grace in&quot;) while training at the [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen Racing School]] for the filming of ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'', a 1969 film. Because of his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host his first television special, ''[[Once Upon a Wheel]],'' on the history of auto racing. It was produced and directed by [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]], who co-owned a number of racing cars with Newman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwinters.net/onceuponawheel.htm|title=Once Upon A Wheel|publisher=Davidwinters.net|access-date=February 1, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005062236/http://www.davidwinters.net/onceuponawheel.htm|archive-date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwinters.net/archives.htm|title=David Winters Tribute Site|publisher=Davidwinters.net|date=April 1, 2003|access-date=February 1, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217010533/http://www.davidwinters.net/archives.htm|archive-date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman's first professional event as a racer was in 1972 at [[Thompson International Speedway]], quietly entered as &quot;P.

He was a frequent competitor in [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) events for the rest of the decade, eventually winning four national championships. He later drove in the [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in Dick Barbour's [[Porsche 935]] and finished in second place.&lt;ref name=&quot;1979 Le Mans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula2.net/1979.htm|title=XLVII Grand Prix d'Endurance les 24 Heures du Mans 1979|publisher=Le Mans &amp; F2 Register|date=May 2, 2008|access-date=September 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman reunited with Barbour in 2000 to compete in the [[2000 Petit Le Mans|Petit Le Mans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Petit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/alms2000.html#9 |title=American Le Mans Series 2000 |publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes |date=October 2, 2005 |access-date=September 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005044003/http://wsrp.ic.cz/alms2000.html |archive-date=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, he drove for the ''[[Bob Sharp (racing driver)|Bob Sharp]] Racing'' team, racing mainly [[Datsun]]s (later rebranded as [[Nissan Motors|Nissans]]) in the [[Trans-Am Series]]. He became closely associated with the brand during the 1980s, even appearing in commercials for them in Japan and having [[Nissan Skyline#Sixth generation (R30; 1981)|a special edition of the Nissan Skyline]] named after him. At the age of 70 years and eight days, Newman became the oldest driver to date to be part of a winning team in a major sanctioned race,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Vaughn|first=Mark|title=Paul Newman 1925–2008|magazine=[[AutoWeek]]|volume=58|issue=40|page=43|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning in his class at the 1995 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 Daytona&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1995.html#1 |title=International Motor Sports Association 1995 |publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=September 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408195356/http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1995.html |archive-date=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his last major races were the [[Baja 1000]] in 2004 and the 24 Hours of Daytona once again in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005 Daytona&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/grandam2005.html#1|title=Grand-American Road Racing Championship 2005|publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes|date=December 17, 2005|access-date=September 27, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012210032/http://wsrp.ic.cz/grandam2005.html#1|archive-date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1976 auto racing season, Newman became interested in forming a professional auto racing team and contacted [[Bill Freeman (racing driver)|Bill Freeman]] who introduced Newman to professional auto racing management, and their company specialized in [[Can-Am]], [[IndyCar Series|Indy Cars]], and other high-performance racing automobiles. The team was based in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and commuted to [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park]] for much of its testing sessions.

Their ''Newman Freeman Racing'' team was very competitive in the North American [[Can-Am]] series in their Budweiser sponsored Chevrolet-powered [[Spyder NF-10|Spyder NFs]]. Newman and Freeman began a long and successful partnership with the Newman Freeman Racing team in the Can-Am series which culminated in the Can-Am Team Championship trophy in 1979. Newman was associated with Freeman's established [[Porsche racing]] team which allowed both Newman and Freeman to compete in [[SCCA]] and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] racing events together, including the [[12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring 12-hour endurance sports car race]]. This car was sponsored by Beverly Porsche/Audi. Freeman was [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s Southern Pacific National Champion during the ''Newman Freeman Racing'' period. Later Newman co-founded [[Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing|''Newman/Haas Racing'']] with [[Carl Haas]], a [[Champ Car]] team, in 1983, going on to win eight drivers' championships under his ownership. The 1996 racing season was chronicled in the [[IMAX]] film ''[[Super Speedway]]'' (1997), which Newman narrated. He was a partner in the [[Atlantic Championship]] team ''[[Newman Wachs Racing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newmanwachsracing.com/index.php/2016/10/07/legendary-newman-name-returning-to-open-wheel-racing/|title=Legendary Newman Name Returning to Open-Wheel Racing – Newman Wachs Racing|website=newmanwachsracing.com|language=en-US|access-date=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman voiced ''[[Doc Hudson]]'' in ''[[Cars (2006)]]''.

Having said he would quit &quot;when I embarrass myself&quot;, Newman competed into his 80s, winning at [[Lime Rock Park|Lime Rock]] in what former co-driver [[Sam Posey]] called a &quot;brutish Corvette&quot; displaying his age as its number: 81.&lt;ref name=&quot;P.L. Newman&quot;/&gt; He took the pole in his last professional race, in 2007 at Watkins Glen International, and in a 2008 run at Lime Rock, arranged by friends, he reportedly still did 9/10ths of his best time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivingline.com/2012/04/paul-newman-from-lime-rock-connecticut|title=PL Newman from Lime Rock Connecticut|publisher=DRIVINGLine|date=April 17, 2012|access-date=September 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman was posthumously inducted into the [[SCCA Hall of Fame]] at the national convention in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]] on February 21, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scca.org/newsarticle.aspx?hub=6&amp;news=3533|title=Newman Leads List of New SCCA Hall of Fame Inductees|publisher=Sports Car Club of America|date=December 3, 2008|access-date=March 13, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610053825/http://www.scca.org/newsarticle.aspx?hub=6&amp;news=3533|archive-date=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman's racing life was chronicled in the documentary ''[[Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman]]'' (2015).

==Personal life==
Newman was married twice. His first marriage was to Jackie Witte&lt;ref name=&quot;tiscali&quot;/&gt; from 1949 to 1958. They had a son, [[Scott Newman (actor)|Scott]] (1950{{ndash}}1978), and two daughters, Susan (born 1953) and Stephanie Kendall (born 1954).&lt;ref name=&quot;tiscali&quot;/&gt; Scott, who appeared in films including ''[[Breakheart Pass (1975 film)|Breakheart Pass]]'', ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', and the 1977 film ''[[Fraternity Row (Film)|Fraternity Row]]'', died in November 1978 from a drug overdose.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Hunter S.

She also received an Emmy nomination as co-producer of his telefilm, ''The Shadow Box''.

Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, &quot;Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?&quot; He also said that he never met anyone who had as much to lose as he did.

Film critic Shawn Levy, in his biography ''Paul Newman: A Life'' (2009), alleged that Newman had an affair in the late 1960s with divorcée Nancy Bacon, a Hollywood journalist, which lasted one and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5262240/Paul-Newman-was-a-drunk-adulterer-according-to-new-book.html|title=Paul Newman was a drunk adulterer, according to new book|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Nikkhah|first=Roya|date=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/book-details-paul-newmans-charmed-and-charming-life/2469147/|title=Book details Paul Newman's charmed, and charming, 'Life'|work=USA Today|date=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the ''[[Irish Independent]]''- which stated also that Levy's claims &quot;caused outrage&quot; and were widely considered &quot;an attempt to sully the image of a revered cinematic legend and committed philanthropist&quot;- the affair was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman's wife Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim. Levy criticised the tabloid newspaper The ''[[New York Post]]'', which had a long-standing feud with Newman, for focusing on and emphasising this aspect of his biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-assassination-of-saint-paul-26534532.html|title=The assassination of 'Saint Paul'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Palmer|first=Caitriona|date=May 9, 2009|access-date=June 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
Newman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the [[Westport Country Playhouse]]'s 2008 production of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |title=Citing Health, Newman Steps Down as Director of Westport's ''Of Mice and Men'' |date=May 23, 2008 |access-date=June 15, 2008 |magazine=[[Playbill]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629080101/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118076.html |archive-date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Newman and his wife received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by&amp;nbsp;[[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National - Jefferson Awards|work=Jefferson Awards|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman won [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''The Long, Hot Summer'' and the Silver Bear at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] for ''Nobody's Fool''.&lt;ref name=IMDb1/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcmdb1/&gt;

In 1968, Newman was named ''Man of the Year'' by [[Harvard University]]'s performance group, the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]].&lt;ref name=tcmdb1/&gt;

The 2008 Edition of ''[[Sport Movies &amp; TV – Milano International FICTS Fest]]'' was dedicated to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportmoviestv.com/en/sport-movies-tv-past-editions/20647-2/|title=Edition 2008 - Ficts|work=Ficts|access-date=May 25, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] issued a '[[forever stamp]]' honoring Newman, which went on sale September 18, 2015. It features a 1980 photograph of Newman by photographer Steve Schapiro, accompanied by text that reads: 'Actor/Philanthropist'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2015/pr15_040.htm &quot;U.S. Postal Service to Issue Paul Newman Forever Stamp&quot;], usps.com, June 29, 2015. Retrieved October 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, an event called ''[[Newman Day]]'' has been celebrated at Kenyon College, [[Bates College]], [[Princeton University]], and other American colleges. On ''Newman Day'', students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours, based on a quote attributed to Newman about there being 24 beers in a case, and 24 hours in a day, and that this is surely not a mere coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'': [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2007/04/24/news/18231.shtml Carol Lu, &quot;If I had a nickel for every beer I drank today.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014926/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2007/04/24/news/18231.shtml |date=September 30, 2007 }} April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University disassociate the event from his name, due to the fact that he did not endorse the behavior, citing his creation in 1980 of the Scott Newman Centre, &quot;dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education&quot;. Princeton disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the university itself and is solely an unofficial event among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Binge drink ritual upsets actor|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3652179.stm|work=BBC News|date=April 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Cheng|title=Newman's Day – forget it, star urges drinkers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/23/1082616331695.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=April 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

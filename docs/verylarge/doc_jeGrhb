{{Main|Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |access-date=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archive-date = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the &quot;universal character of the crimes in question&quot; and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered &quot;grave offenses against the law of nations itself&quot;.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that &quot;provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned&quot;.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

===Malaysia===

In November 2011, the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] purportedly exercised universal jurisdiction to [[trial in absentia|try and convict ''in absentia'']] former US President [[George W. Bush]] and former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57324770/symbolic-war-crimes-tribunal-to-try-bush-blair/ |title=Symbolic 'war crimes' tribunal to try Bush, Blair |date=15 November 2011 |publisher=CBS News |access-date=16 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101115154/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501712_162-57324770/symbolic-war-crimes-tribunal-to-try-bush-blair |archive-date=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Bush+Blair+guilty+Malaysia+crimes+trial/5748925/story.html#ixzz1eaKHipRQ |title=Bush, Blair guilty in Malaysia 'war crimes trial'|work=Ottawa Citizen |date=22 November 2011 |access-date=24 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113051951/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Bush+Blair+guilty+Malaysia+crimes+trial/5748925/story.html#ixzz1eaKHipRQ|archive-date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the tribunal again under a purported exercise of universal jurisdiction took testimony from victims of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]] and [[Guantanamo]], and convicted ''in absentia'' former President Bush, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], former Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]], former Deputy Assistant Attorneys General [[John Choon Yoo|John Yoo]] and [[Jay Bybee]], former Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]], and former counselors [[David Addington]] and [[William Haynes II]] for conspiracy to commit war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/international/are-george-w-bush-and-dick-cheney-war-criminals-malaysian-court-says-yes |title=Are George W.

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: &quot;Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal&quot;], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |work=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Associated Press&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Nobel peace prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] brought a case against the [[Guatemala]]n military leadership in a Spanish Court. Six officials, among them [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] and [[Óscar Humberto Mejía]], were formally charged on 7 July 2006 to appear in the Spanish National Court after Spain's Constitutional Court ruled in September 2005, the Spanish Constitutional Court declaration that the &quot;principle of universal jurisdiction prevails over the existence of national interests&quot;, following the Menchu suit brought against the officials for atrocities committed in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/spain-judge-charges-ex-generals-in.php|title=Spain judge charges ex-generals in Guatemala genocide case|publisher=Jurist|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish Supreme Court: Guatemala Genocide Case | publisher=Nizkor Project | date=25 February 2003 | url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/guatemala/doc/stsgtm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] jailed [[Ricardo Miguel Cavallo]], a former [[Argentina|Argentine]] naval officer, who was extradited from Mexico to Spain pending his trial on charges of genocide and terrorism relating to the years of Argentina's military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A13FD3F5E0C738FDDAF0894DB404482|title=Spanish Judge Sends Argentine to Prison on Genocide Charge|first=Emma|last=Daly|work=The New York Times|date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3085482.stm|title=Profile: Judge Baltasar Garzon|publisher=BBC|date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2006, the [[Audiencia Nacional|Spanish High Court]] agreed to investigate a case in which seven former Chinese officials, including the former [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Jiang Zemin]] and former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] were alleged to have participated in a genocide in [[Tibet]]. This investigation follows a Spanish Constitutional Court (26 September 2005) ruling that Spanish courts could try genocide cases even if they did not involve Spanish nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain to investigate 'genocide' in Tibet|work=The Independent|date=11 January 2006|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10363286 |title=Spanish court to investigate Tibet massacre case|agency=Reuters|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=12 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; China denounced the investigation as an interference in its internal affairs and dismissed the allegations as &quot;sheer fabrication&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexa|last=Olesen|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article656410.ece|title=China rejects Spain's 'genocide' claim|work=The Independent|date=7 June 2006|location=London|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613125127/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article656410.ece|archive-date=13 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was shelved in 2010, because of a law passed in 2009 that restricted High Court investigations to those &quot;involving Spanish victims, suspects who are in Spain, or some other obvious link with Spain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=26740|title=Spanish court shelves Tibet human rights case against China|publisher=[[phayul.com]]|agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]|date=26 February 2010|access-date=6 September 2010|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints were lodged against former [[Israeli Defense Forces]] chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. (res.) [[Dan Halutz]] and six other senior Israeli political and military officials by pro-Palestinian organizations, who sought to prosecute them in Spain under the principle of universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Izenberg |first=Dan |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=173480 |title=Universal jurisdiction victory in Spain but battle goes on |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=19 April 2010 |access-date=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service |first=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/spanish-war-crimes-probe-against-israeli-officials-to-go-on-1.271096 |title=Spanish war crimes probe against Israeli officials to go on |work=Haaretz |date=20 January 2010 |access-date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2009, [[Fernando Andreu]], a judge of the Audiencia Nacional, opened preliminary investigations into claims that a [[targeted killing]] attack in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] in 2002 warranted the prosecution of Halutz, the former [[Defense Minister of Israel|Israeli defence minister]] [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]], the former defence chief-of-staff [[Moshe Ya'alon]], and four others, for [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].

After a denunciation from Amnesty International, Nepal's [[Colonel Kumar Lama]] was charged in UK with torture, but was then acquitted.

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico (&quot;forcible abduction&quot;) to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1896 Summer Olympics''' ({{lang-el|Θερινοί Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 1896|link=no|Therinoí Olympiakoí Agónes 1896}}), officially known as the '''Games of the I Olympiad''', was the first international [[Olympic Games]] held in [[modern history]]. Organised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), which had been created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], it was held in [[Athens]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], from 6 to 15 April 1896.

Fourteen nations and 241 athletes (all males) took part in the games. Participants were all European, or living in Europe, with the exception of the [[United States at the 1896 Summer Olympics|United States team]]. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has converted these to gold and silver, and awarded bronze medals to third placed athletes. Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals. The United States won the most gold medals, 11, host nation Greece won the most medals overall, 46. The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spyridon Louis]]. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four events. Over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek.

Athens had been unanimously chosen to stage the inaugural modern Games during a congress organised by Coubertin in Paris on 23 June 1894, during which the IOC was also created, because [[Greece]] was the birthplace of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The main venue was the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], where athletics and wrestling took place; other venues included the [[Neo Phaliron Velodrome]] for [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|cycling]], and the [[Zappeion]] for [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|fencing]]. The opening ceremony was held in the Panathenaic Stadium on 6 April, during which most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]], his father officially opened the Games. Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by poet [[Kostis Palamas]].

The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The [[Panathenaic Stadium]] overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y153&quot;&gt;Young (1996), 153&lt;/ref&gt; After the Games, Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures, including Greece's [[George I of Greece|King George]] and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] were already planned for Paris and, except for the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games of 1906]], the Olympics did not return to Greece until the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], 108 years later.

== Reviving the Games ==

During the 19th century, several small-scale sports festivals across Europe were named after the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The 1870 [[Zappas Olympics|Olympics]] at the Panathenaic stadium, which had been refurbished for the occasion, had an audience of 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]] and historian, adopted Dr [[William Penny Brookes]]' idea to establish a multi-national and [[multi-sport event]]—the ancient games only allowed male athletes of Greek origin to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Bijkerk (2004), 457&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toohey (2007), 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in ''La Revue Athletique'', which espoused the importance of [[Much Wenlock]] a rural market town in the English county of [[Shropshire]]. It was here that, in October 1850, the local physician William Penny Brookes had founded the [[Wenlock Olympian Games]], a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports, such as [[cricket]], [[association football|football]] and [[quoits]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, &quot;Pierre de Coubertin and the Wenlock Olympian Games&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organised under the name of [[Zappas Olympics|Olympics]] by businessman and philanthropist [[Evangelis Zappas]] in 1859, 1870 and 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2005), 66; Young (1996), 81&lt;/ref&gt; The 1896 Athens Games were funded by the legacies of [[Evangelis Zappas]] and his cousin [[Konstantinos Zappas]]&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p.117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa – Athens 1893, by F. Martens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'affaire Zappa – Paris 1894, by G. Streit&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[George Averoff]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;Young (1996), p.128&lt;/ref&gt; who had been specifically requested by the Greek government, through crown prince Constantine, to sponsor the second refurbishment of the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]. The Greek government did this despite the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble already being funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=With deep feeling towards Baron de Coubertin's courteous petition, I send him and the members of the Congress, with my sincere thanks, my best wishes for the revival of the Olympic Games.|source=[[George I of Greece|King George]] of Greece (21 June 1894)&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 18 June 1894, Coubertin organised a congress at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], Paris, to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries. Following his proposal's acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held concurrently with the 1900 [[World's Fair|Universal Exposition]] of Paris. Concerned that a six-year waiting period might lessen public interest, congress members opted instead to hold the inaugural Games in 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned their attention to the selection of a host city. It remains a mystery how Athens was finally chosen to host the inaugural Games. In the following years both Coubertin and [[Demetrius Vikelas]] would offer recollections of the selection process that contradicted the official minutes of the congress. Most accounts hold that several congressmen first proposed London as the location, but Coubertin dissented. After a brief discussion with Vikelas, who represented Greece, Coubertin suggested Athens. Vikelas made the Athens proposal official on 23 June, and since Greece had been the original home of the Olympics, the congress unanimously approved the decision. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 100–105&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

News that the Olympic Games would return to Greece was well received by the Greek public, media, and [[Royal Family of Greece|royal family]]. According to Coubertin, &quot;the Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] learned with great pleasure that the Games will be inaugurated in Athens.&quot; Coubertin went on to confirm that, &quot;the King and the Crown Prince will confer their patronage on the holding of these games.&quot; Constantine later conferred more than that; he eagerly assumed the presidency of the 1896 organising committee.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 108&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the country had financial troubles and was in political turmoil. The job of [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|prime minister]] alternated between [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] and [[Theodoros Deligiannis]] frequently during the last years of the 19th century. Because of this financial and political instability, both prime minister Trikoupis and [[Stephanos Dragoumis]], the president of the Zappas Olympic Committee, which had attempted to organise a series of national Olympiads, believed that Greece could not host the event.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 111–118&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1894, the organising committee under [[Stephanos Skouloudis]] presented a report that the cost of the Games would be three times higher than originally estimated by Coubertin. They concluded the Games could not be held, and offered their resignation. The total cost of the Games was 3,740,000 gold [[drachma]]s.&lt;ref name=Zarnowski&gt;Zarnowski (1992), 16–32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demetrius Vikelas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demetrius Vikelas]], the first president of the International Olympic Committee, was credited with the successful organisation of the 1896 Games]]

With the prospect of reviving the Olympic games very much in doubt, Coubertin and Vikelas commenced a campaign to keep the Olympic movement alive. Their efforts culminated on 7 January 1895 when Vikelas announced that crown prince Constantine would assume the presidency of the organising committee. His first responsibility was to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. He relied on the patriotism of the Greek people to motivate them to provide the required finances.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 118. According to Young (2004), 153, &quot;Vikelas and the other Greeks did most of the work. Coubertin did very little.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's enthusiasm sparked a wave of contributions from the Greek public. This grassroots effort raised 330,000 drachmas. A special set of postage stamps were commissioned; the sale of which raised 400,000 drachmas. Ticket sales added 200,000 drachmas. At the request of Constantine, businessman [[George Averoff]] agreed to pay for the restoration of the Panathenaic Stadium. Averoff would donate 920,000 drachmas&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot; /&gt; to this project.&lt;ref&gt;Darling (2004), 135&lt;/ref&gt; As a tribute to his generosity, a statue of Averoff was constructed and unveiled on 5 April 1896 outside the stadium. It stands there to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/04/101824945.pdf George Averoff Dead], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the athletes would take part in the Games because they happened to be in Athens at the time the Games were held, either on holiday or for work (e.g., some of the British competitors worked for the British [[diplomatic mission|embassy]]). A designated [[Olympic Village]] for the athletes did not appear until the [[1932 Summer Olympics]]. Consequently, the athletes had to provide their own lodging.

The first regulation voted on by the new IOC in 1894 was to allow only amateur athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;Some scholars allege that during the Sorbonne congress Coubertin was led by tactical considerations, and used the amateur requirement only as a bait in order to realize his actual aim—namely the reintroduction of the Olympic Games—more quickly (Lennartz–Wassong [2004]), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The various contests were thus held under amateur regulations with the exception of fencing matches.&lt;ref&gt;Professionalism vs amateurism was one of the dominant themes of the 19th century regarding athletics. In Greece the amateurism of athletes debate was taken a step further to encompass the question of the participation of the lower classes in the Games. In 1870, during the Zappian Olympic Games, Philippos Ioannou, a classical scholar and professor, criticised the games, and attacked the ideal of amateurism. His contention was that they were a parody, because people from the working class had taken part in the games. Ioannou suggested that only young people from the upper class should be accepted in the following Olympiad ([http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/304b.html Professionals and Amateurs], Foundation of the Hellenic World).&lt;/ref&gt; The rules and regulations were not uniform, so the Organising Committee had to choose among the codes of the various national athletic associations. The jury, the referees and the game director bore the same names as in antiquity (''Ephor'', ''Helanodic'' and ''Alitarc''). [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]] acted as final referee; according to Coubertin, &quot;his presence gave weight and authority to the decisions of the ephors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C46-47&quot;&gt;Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;cite=&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&amp;tif=00057.TIF&amp;pagenum=46 46–47]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were not entitled to compete at the 1896 Summer Olympics, because de Coubertin felt that their inclusion would be &quot;impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and incorrect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/women.htm|title=Women at the Olympic Games|work=topendsports.com|access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panathinaiko Stadium panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama of the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]

Seven venues were used for the 1896 Summer Olympics. [[Panathenaic Stadium]] was the main venue, hosting four of the nine sports contested. The city of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] served as host to the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] event and the [[road bicycle racing|individual road race]] events. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was held in the [[Bay of Zea]], [[fencing]] at the [[Zappeion]], [[sport shooting]] at [[Kallithea]], and [[tennis]] at the [[Athens Lawn Tennis Club]]. Tennis was a sport unfamiliar to Greeks at the time of the 1896 Games.&lt;ref name=tennis /&gt;

Four of the 1896 venues were reused as competition venues for the 2004 Games. The [[velodrome]] would be renovated into a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium in 1964 and was known as [[Karaiskakis Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stadia.gr/karaiskaki/karaiskakiold.html Stadia.gr profile of Karaiskakoid Stadium in 1895, 1964, and 2003.] - accessed 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This venue was renovated in 2003 for use as a [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|football]] venue for the 2004 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195306/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf |date=19 August 2008 }} Volume 2. p. 324.

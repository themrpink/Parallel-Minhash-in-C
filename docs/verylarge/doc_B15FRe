[[File:Chimpanzee seated at typewriter.jpg|thumb|[[Chimpanzee]] seated at a typewriter]]

The '''infinite monkey theorem''' states that a [[monkey]] hitting keys at [[randomness|random]] on a [[typewriter]] keyboard for an [[infinity|infinite]] amount of time will [[almost surely]] type any given text, such as the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the [[probability]] that monkeys filling the entire [[observable universe]] would type a single complete work, such as Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|orders of magnitude]] longer than the [[age of the universe]] is ''extremely'' low (but technically not zero).

In this context, &quot;almost surely&quot; is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the &quot;monkey&quot; is not an actual monkey, but a [[metaphor]] for an [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] device that produces an endless [[random sequence]] of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the &quot;monkey metaphor&quot; is that of French mathematician [[Émile Borel]] in 1913,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; but the first instance may have been even earlier.

Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the history of this idea from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De natura deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods), through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and [[Arthur Eddington]] used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]].

==Solution==

===Direct proof===
There is a straightforward proof of this theorem. As an introduction, recall that if two events are [[statistically independent]], then the probability of both happening equals the product of the probabilities of each one happening independently. For example, if the chance of rain in [[Moscow]] on a particular day in the future is 0.4 and the chance of an [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] on any particular day is 0.00003, then the chance of both happening on the same day is {{nowrap|1=0.4 × 0.00003 = 0.000012}}, assuming that they are indeed independent.

Suppose the typewriter has 50 keys, and the word to be typed is ''banana''. If the keys are pressed randomly and independently, it means that each key has an equal chance of being pressed. Then, the chance that the first letter typed is 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is 'a' is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the chance of the first six letters spelling ''banana'' is
:(1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) = (1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/15&amp;nbsp;625&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;,
less than one in 15&amp;nbsp;billion, but ''not'' zero.

From the above, the chance of ''not'' typing ''banana'' in a given block of 6 letters is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each block is typed independently, the chance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of not typing ''banana'' in any of the first ''n'' blocks of 6 letters is

:&lt;math&gt;X_n=\left(1-\frac{1}{50^6}\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' grows, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; gets smaller. For ''n'' = 1 million, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.9999, but for ''n'' = 10&amp;nbsp;billion ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.53 and for ''n'' = 100&amp;nbsp;billion it is roughly 0.0017. As ''n'' approaches infinity, the probability ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[limit of a function|approaches]] zero; that is, by making ''n'' large enough, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be made as small as is desired,&lt;ref name=&quot;Isaac1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaac |first=Richard E. |title=The Pleasures of Probability |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn = 0-387-94415-X |pages=48–50}} – Isaac generalizes this argument immediately to variable text and alphabet size; the common main conclusion is on page&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This shows that the probability of typing &quot;banana&quot; in one of the predefined non-overlapping blocks of six letters tends to 1. In addition the word may appear across two blocks, so the estimate given is conservative.}} and the chance of typing ''banana'' approaches 100%.

The same argument shows why at least one of infinitely many monkeys will produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original. In this case ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that none of the first ''n'' monkeys types ''banana'' correctly on their first try. When we consider 100&amp;nbsp;billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys ''n'' increases, the value of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; – the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text – approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for ''n'' going to infinity, is zero.  So the probability of the word ''banana'' appearing at some point in an infinite sequence of keystrokes is equal to one.

====Infinite strings====
This can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of [[string (computer science)|strings]], which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:
* Given an infinite string where each character is chosen [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]], any given finite string almost surely occurs as a [[substring]] at some position.
* Given an infinite sequence of infinite strings, where each character of each string is chosen uniformly at random, any given finite string almost surely occurs as a prefix of one of these strings.

Both follow easily from the second [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]. For the second theorem, let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[event (probability theory)|event]] that the ''k''th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability ''p'' of occurring, the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent, and the below sum diverges,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(E_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
the probability that infinitely many of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text, and make ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; the event where the ''k''th block equals the desired string.{{efn|The first theorem is proven by a similar if more indirect route in Gut (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gut |first=Allan |title=Probability: A Graduate Course |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-22833-0 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Probabilities===
However, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time the results are reversed. If there were as many monkeys as there are atoms in the observable universe typing extremely fast for trillions of times the life of the universe, the probability of the monkeys replicating even a ''single page'' of Shakespeare is unfathomably small.

Ignoring punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of ''[[Hamlet]].'' It has a chance of one in 676 (26&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;26) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks [[exponential growth|exponentially]], at 20&amp;nbsp;letters it already has only a chance of one in 26&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376{{efn|Nearly 20 octillion}} (almost 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of the entire text of ''Hamlet'', the probabilities are so vanishingly small as to be inconceivable. The text of Hamlet contains approximately 130,000&amp;nbsp;letters.{{efn|Using the Hamlet text {{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/1ws2611.txt |title=from gutenberg.org}}, there are 132680&amp;nbsp;alphabetical letters and 199749 characters overall}} Thus there is a probability of one in 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;,{{efn|For any required string of 130,000&amp;nbsp;letters from the set 'a'-'z', the average number of letters that needs to be typed until the string appears is (rounded) 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;, except in the case that all letters of the required string are equal, in which case the value is about 4% more, 3.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;. In that case failure to have the correct string starting from a particular position reduces with about 4% the probability of a correct string starting from the next position (i.e., for overlapping positions the events of having the correct string are not independent; in this case there is a positive correlation between the two successes, so the chance of success after a failure is smaller than the chance of success in general). The figure 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; is derived from ''n'' {{=}}&amp;nbsp;26&lt;sup&gt;130000&lt;/sup&gt; by taking the logarithm of both sides: log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') {{=}} 1300000×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(26) {{=}}&amp;nbsp;183946.5352, therefore ''n'' {{=}}&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;0.5352&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}}&amp;nbsp;3.429&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt;.}} or including punctuation, 4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;.{{efn|26&amp;nbsp;letters ×2 for capitalisation, 12 for punctuation characters {{=}} 64, 199749×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64) {{=}}&amp;nbsp;4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt; (this is generous as it assumes capital letters are separate keys, as opposed to a key combination, which makes the problem vastly harder).}}

Even if every proton in the observable universe were a monkey with a typewriter, typing from the [[Big Bang]] until the [[end of the universe]] (when protons [[Proton decay|might no longer exist]]), they would still need a far greater amount of time – more than three hundred and sixty thousand ''orders of magnitude'' longer – to have even a 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; chance of success. To put it another way, for a one in a trillion chance of success, there would need to be 10&lt;sup&gt;360,641&lt;/sup&gt; observable universes made of protonic monkeys.{{efn|There are ~10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;protons in the observable universe. Assume the monkeys write for 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years is when [[Future of an expanding universe#Stellar remnants escape galaxies or fall into black holes|all stellar remnants will have either been ejected from their galaxies or fallen into black holes]], 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years is when all but 0.1% of [[Future of an expanding universe#All nucleons decay|protons have decayed]]). Assuming the monkeys type non-stop at a ridiculous 400&amp;nbsp;[[words per minute]] (the world record is 216&amp;nbsp;[[words per minute|WPM]] for a single minute), that's about 2,000&amp;nbsp;characters per minute (Shakespeare's average word length is a bit under 5&amp;nbsp;letters). There are about half a million minutes in a year, this means each monkey types half a billion characters per year. This gives a total of 10{{sup|80}}×10{{sup|38}}×10{{sup|9}} {{=}} 10{{sup|127}} letters typed – which is still zero in comparison to 10{{sup|360,783}}.

In fact there is less than a one in a trillion chance of success that such a universe made of monkeys could type any particular document a mere 79&amp;nbsp;characters long.{{efn|As explained at {{cite web |url=http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |title=More monkeys |access-date=2013-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016011846/http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |archive-date=2009-10-16 |df=dmy-all}} the problem can be approximated further: 10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64) {{=}}&amp;nbsp;78.9 characters.}}

===Almost surely===
{{Main|Almost surely}}

The probability that an infinite randomly generated string of text will contain a particular finite substring is&amp;nbsp;1. However, this does not mean the substring's absence is &quot;impossible&quot;, despite the absence having a prior probability of 0. For example, the immortal monkey ''could'' randomly type G as its first letter, G as its second, and G as every single letter thereafter, producing an infinite string of Gs; at no point must the monkey be &quot;compelled&quot; to type anything else. (To assume otherwise implies the [[gambler's fallacy]].) However long a randomly generated finite string is, there is a small but nonzero chance that it will turn out to consist of the same character repeated throughout; this chance approaches zero as the string's length approaches infinity. There is nothing special about such a monotonous sequence except that it is easy to describe; the same fact applies to any nameable specific sequence, such as &quot;RGRGRG&quot; repeated forever, or &quot;a-b-aa-bb-aaa-bbb-...&quot;, or &quot;Three, Six, Nine, Twelve…&quot;.

If the hypothetical monkey has a typewriter with 90 equally likely keys that include numerals and punctuation, then the first typed keys might be &quot;3.14&quot; (the first three [[digits of pi]]) with a probability of (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1/65,610,000. Equally probable is any other string of four characters allowed by the typewriter, such as &quot;GGGG&quot;, &quot;mATh&quot;, or &quot;q%8e&quot;. The probability that 100 randomly typed keys will consist of the first 99 digits of pi (including the separator key), or any other ''particular'' sequence of that length, is much lower: (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;. If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digits of pi is 0, which is just as ''possible'' (mathematically probable) as typing nothing but Gs (also probability 0).

The same applies to the event of typing a particular version of ''Hamlet'' followed by endless copies of itself; or ''Hamlet'' immediately followed by all the digits of pi; these specific strings are [[infinite set|equally infinite]] in length, they are not prohibited by the terms of the thought problem, and they each have a prior probability of 0. In fact, ''any'' particular infinite sequence the immortal monkey types will have ''had'' a prior probability of 0, even though the monkey must type something.

This is an extension of the principle that a finite string of random text has a lower and lower probability of ''being'' a particular string the longer it is (though all specific strings are equally unlikely). This probability approaches 0 as the string approaches infinity. Thus, the probability of the monkey typing an endlessly long string, such as all of the digits of pi in order, on a 90-key keyboard is (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; which equals (1/∞) which is essentially 0. At the same time, the probability that the sequence ''contains'' a particular subsequence (such as the word MONKEY, or the 12th through 999th digits of pi, or a version of the King James Bible) increases as the total string increases. This probability approaches 1 as the total string approaches infinity, and thus the original theorem is correct.

===Correspondence between strings and numbers===
In a simplification of the thought experiment, the monkey could have a typewriter with just two keys: 1 and 0. The infinitely long string thusly produced would correspond to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] digits of a particular [[real number]] between 0 and 1. A countably infinite set of possible strings end in infinite repetitions, which means the corresponding real number is [[rational number|rational]]. Examples include the strings corresponding to one-third (010101...), five-sixths (11010101...) and five-eighths (1010000...).  Only a subset of such real number strings (albeit a countably infinite subset) contains the entirety of ''Hamlet'' (assuming that the text is subjected to a numerical encoding, such as [[ASCII]]).

Meanwhile, there is an ''[[uncountably]]'' infinite set of strings which do not end in such repetition; these correspond to the [[irrational numbers]]. These can be sorted into two uncountably infinite subsets: those which contain ''Hamlet'' and those which do not. However, the &quot;largest&quot; subset of all the real numbers are those which not only contain ''Hamlet'', but which contain every other possible string of any length, and with equal distribution of such strings. These irrational numbers are called [[normal number|normal]]. Because almost all numbers are normal, almost all possible strings contain all possible finite substrings. Hence, the probability of the monkey typing a normal number is 1. The same principles apply regardless of the number of keys from which the monkey can choose; a 90-key keyboard can be seen as a generator of numbers written in base 90.

===Statistical mechanics===
In one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its &quot;dactylographic&quot; [i.e., typewriting] monkeys ({{lang-fr|singes dactylographes}}; the French word ''singe'' covers both the monkeys and the apes), appeared in [[Émile Borel]]'s 1913 article &quot;''Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité''&quot; (''[[Statistical mechanics]] and irreversibility''),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Émile Borel | title=Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité | journal=J.

Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly.

The physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] drew on Borel's image further in ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928), writing:

{{quote|If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence.

These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;KK&quot; /&gt;  It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.

In a 1939 essay entitled &quot;The Total Library&quot;, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the infinite-monkey concept back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics.'' Explaining the views of [[Leucippus]], who held that the world arose through the random combination of atoms, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same &quot;atoms&quot;, ''i.e.'', alphabetic characters.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς'' (''On Generation and Corruption''), 315b14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three centuries later, [[Cicero]]'s ''De natura deorum'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') argued against the atomist worldview:

{{quote|He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the ''Annals'' of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tullius Cicero, ''De natura deorum'', 2.37. Translation from ''Cicero's Tusculan Disputations; Also, Treatises On The Nature Of The Gods, And On The Commonwealth'', C. D. Yonge, principal translator, New York, Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, Franklin Square. (1877). [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988 Downloadable text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges follows the history of this argument through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]],&lt;ref&gt;The English translation of &quot;The Total Library&quot; lists the title of Swift's essay as &quot;Trivial Essay on the Faculties of the Soul.&quot;  The appropriate reference is, instead: Swift, Jonathan, Temple Scott et al. &quot;A Tritical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind.&quot; The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, Volume 1. London: G. Bell, 1897, pp. 291-296. [https://archive.org/details/proseworksjonat01berngoog &lt;!-- quote=The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift. --&gt; Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was &quot;that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.&quot; (To which Borges adds, &quot;Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.&quot;) Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:

{{quote|Everything would be in its blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, [[Aeschylus]]' ''The Egyptians'', the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true nature of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of [[Pierre Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's last theorem|theorem]], the unwritten chapters of ''[[Edwin Drood]]'', those same chapters translated into the language spoken by the [[Garamantes]], the paradoxes Berkeley invented concerning Time but didn't publish, Urizen's books of iron, the premature epiphanies of [[Stephen Dedalus]], which would be meaningless before a cycle of a thousand years, the Gnostic [[Gospel of Basilides]], the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves – shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies – ever reward them with a tolerable page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author-link=Jorge Luis Borges |last=Borges |first=Jorge Luis |title=La biblioteca total |trans-title=The Total Library |magazine=Sur |issue=59 |date=August 1939}} republished in {{cite book |translator-link=Eliot Weinberger |translator-first=Eliot |translator-last=Weinberger |title=Selected Non-Fictions |publisher=Penguin |year=1999 |isbn=0-670-84947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges' total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story &quot;[[The Library of Babel]]&quot;, which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.

==Actual monkeys==
In 2002,&lt;ref name=vivariaNotesShakespeare/&gt; lecturers and students from the [[University of Plymouth]] MediaLab Arts course used a £2,000&amp;nbsp;grant from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six [[Celebes crested macaque]]s in [[Paignton Zoo]] in [[Devon]], [[England]] for a month, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=No words to describe monkeys' play |date=2003-05-09 |website=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3013959.stm |access-date=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the monkeys produce nothing but five total pages largely consisting of the letter 'S',&lt;ref name=vivariaNotesShakespeare/&gt; the lead male began striking the keyboard with a stone, and other monkeys followed by soiling it. Mike Phillips, director of the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technology (i-DAT), said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned &quot;an awful lot&quot; from it. He concluded that monkeys &quot;are not random generators. They're more complex than that. ... They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated2003&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58790,00.html |title=Monkeys don't write Shakespeare |agency=Associated Press |magazine=Wired News |date=2003-05-09 |access-date=2007-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201230858/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0%2C1284%2C58790%2C00.html |archive-date=2004-02-01 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and criticisms==

===Evolution===
[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley - Project Gutenberg eText 16935.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Huxley]] is sometimes misattributed with proposing a variant of the theory in his debates with [[Samuel Wilberforce]].]]
In his 1931 book ''The Mysterious Universe'', Eddington's rival [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] attributed the monkey parable to a &quot;Huxley&quot;, presumably meaning [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. This attribution is incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Padmanabhan2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thanu |last=Padmanabhan |title=The dark side of astronomy |journal=Nature |volume=435 |pages=20–21 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/435020a |issue=7038|bibcode=2005Natur.435...20P |doi-access=free }} {{cite book |author=Platt, Suzy |title=Respectfully quoted: a dictionary of quotations |year=1993 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=0-88029-768-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/respectfullyquot00suzy/page/388 388–389] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/respectfullyquot00suzy/page/388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|now-legendary debate]] over [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, held at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Oxford on 30 June 1860. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter itself had yet to emerge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rescher2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Rescher |title=Studies in the Philosophy of Science |year=2006 |publisher=ontos verlag |isbn=3-938793-20-1 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. As an example of [[Christian apologetics]] Doug Powell argued that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of ''Hamlet'', it has failed to produce ''Hamlet'' because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in [[DNA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Powell2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Doug |title=Holman Quicksource Guide to Christian Apologetics |year=2006 |publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman | isbn = 0-8054-9460-X |pages=60, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common argument is represented by Reverend [[John F. MacArthur]], who claimed that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacArthur2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=MacArthur |title=Think Biblically!: Recovering a Christian Worldview |year=2003 |publisher=Crossway Books |isbn=1-58134-412-0 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] employs the typing monkey concept in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to demonstrate the ability of [[natural selection]] to produce biological [[complexity]] out of random [[mutation]]s. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his [[weasel program]] produce the Hamlet phrase ''METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL'', starting from a randomly typed parent, by &quot;breeding&quot; subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent, with random mutations. The chance of the target phrase appearing in a single step is extremely small, yet Dawkins showed that it could be produced rapidly (in about 40 generations) using cumulative selection of phrases.  The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information.  As Dawkins acknowledges, however, the weasel program is an imperfect analogy for evolution, as &quot;offspring&quot; phrases were selected &quot;according to the criterion of resemblance to a ''distant ideal'' target.&quot;  In contrast, Dawkins affirms, evolution has no long-term plans and does not progress toward some distant goal (such as humans).  The weasel program is instead meant to illustrate the difference between [[non-random]] cumulative selection, and [[random]] single-step selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=1996 |title=The Blind Watchmaker |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=0-393-31570-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blindwatchmaker0000dawk/page/46 46–50] |url=https://archive.org/details/blindwatchmaker0000dawk/page/46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the typing monkey analogy, this means that ''Romeo and Juliet'' could be produced relatively quickly if placed under the constraints of a nonrandom, Darwinian-type selection because the [[fitness function]] will tend to preserve in place any letters that happen to match the target text, improving each successive generation of typing monkeys.

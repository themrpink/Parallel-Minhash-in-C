=====Incomplete information or elements of chance=====
In contrast to classical chess which is a game of [[complete information]], these either have elements of chance or players do not have [[perfect information]] as to the state of the board.

* '''ChessHeads''': Played with cards that change the game rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessmate.com/ChessHeads.html ChessHeads] chessmate.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12932 ChessHeads] BoardGameGeek&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Dark chess]]''': The player sees only squares of the board that are attacked by their pieces.
* '''[[Dice chess]]''': The pieces a player is able to move are determined by rolling a pair of dice.
* '''Fantasy Chess''': Chess with wargaming added. Players fight for squares (which can be co-occupied) using dice. Can be expanded to four players; piece capability can improve each game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shadowhex.com/|title=home page for Fantasy Chess|website=shadowhex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Knightmare Chess]]''': Played with cards that change the game rules.
* '''[[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]''': Neither player knows where the opponent's pieces are but can deduce them with information from a referee.
* '''No Stress Chess''': Marketed for teaching beginners, the piece(s) a player is able to move are determined by drawing from a deck of cards, with each card providing the rules for how the piece may move. Castling and ''[[en passant]]'' are disallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19918/no-stress-chess|title=No Stress Chess|website=BoardGameGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Penultima (game)|Penultima]]''': An inductive variant where the players must deduce hidden rules invented by &quot;Spectators&quot;.
* '''Schrödinger's chess''': Players' minor pieces are concealed so the opponent does not know what they are until revealed. When covered, pieces move in a restricted way (as queens that can only move two squares).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elvis.rowan.edu/~kilroy/other/?chess|title=Darren's Other Stuff|website=elvis.rowan.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Synchronous Chess''': Players try to outguess each other, moving simultaneously after privately recording intended moves and anticipated results. Incompatible moves, for instance to the same square with no anticipated capture, are replayed. Alternatively, two pieces moving to the same square are both captured, unless one is the king, in which case it captures the other. Play ends with capture of king.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=100}}
* '''WeGo Chess''': Like synchronous chess, but with added rules that avoid replay. Players move simultaneously after privately recording intended moves. A piece can't be moved two turns in a row. Two pieces moving on the same line, but in opposite direction, are both captured if they end up on the same square or cross each other. It follows that two knights would avoid simultaneous capture. Play ends with capture of king.
* '''Viennese Chess''': A barrier or screen between the two halves of the chessboard, two players then place their pieces on their half of the board. The barrier is then lifted and the game is then played as in orthodox chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/diffsetup.dir/viennese.html|title=Viennese Chess|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Alice Chess]]''': Played with two boards: a piece moved on one board passes &quot;through the looking glass&quot; onto the other board. By [[V. R. Parton]] (1953).
* '''[[Apocalypse (chess variant)|Apocalypse]]''': On a 5×5 board, each side has two knights and five pawns, win by eliminating all enemy pawns. Prepared moves are executed simultaneously. By C. S. Elliott (1976).
* '''[[Chad (chess variant)|Chad]]''': Kings are limited to 3×3 &quot;castles&quot; on a 12×12 board dominated by eight rooks per side which can promote to queens. By Christian Freeling (1979).
* '''[[Chessence]]''': Nine pieces per player move according to their relative positions to each other on a 6×9 board with missing squares and kings immobile in the corners. By Jim Winslow (1989).
* '''Colour Chess''': Played on a multicoloured board of six colours, with the order of turns taken as in '''Marseillais chess''' but with rules indicating which colour each piece may move to. The game is won by capturing the opponent's king (rather than checkmate) and kings may remain in check. Similar variants include '''Sequence Colour Chess''', and '''Swarm Colour Chess'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h03T_fwcHk|title=COLOUR CHESS - How to Play|date=September 1, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dogearedgames.com/colourchess/|title=Colour Chess + Lure}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By Tom Norfolk (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217977/colour-chess-lure|title=Colour Chess + Lure|website=BoardGameGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Congo (chess variant)|Congo]]''': Kings (lions) are limited to 3×3 &quot;castles&quot; on a 7×7 board. By Demian Freeling (1982).    
* '''[[Diplomat chess]]''': Played on a circular board with 43 cells, including the centre circle which is considered [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] ''and'' diagonal to every adjacent cell. Includes a 'diplomat' piece which instead of capturing can suborn enemy pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.org/43.dir/diplomat/diplomat-chess.html|title=Diplomat Chess}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Dragonfly (chess variant)|Dragonfly]]''': Played on a 7×7 or hex board, no queens, captured non-pawn pieces never die (ala Chessgi) and can be dropped on any open square. By Christian Freeling.
* '''[[Jeson Mor]]''': Nine knights per side on a 9×9 board. The first to occupy square e5, and then leave it, wins the game. From Mongolia. 
* '''[[Parallel Worlds Chess]]''': A 3D variant using three boards, each player commands two armies, capturing either enemy king wins. The middle board is a sort of &quot;twilight zone&quot; obeying its own rules. By R. Wayne Schmittberger (1980s).
* '''[[Rollerball (chess variant)|Rollerball]]''': Inspired by the sci-fi film of the same name, pieces move clockwise around a Roller Derby-like track. By Jean-Louis Cazaux (1998).
* '''[[Sovereign Chess]]''': This variant is played on a 16×16 board. In addition to the standard black and white pieces, the board is also encircled by 80 other coloured pieces (10 colours of 8 pieces each). Coloured squares near the center of the board correspond to the coloured pieces around the board, and when a player's piece occupies a coloured square, that player gains control of the matching coloured pieces. If a piece on a coloured square is moved or captured, control of the matching pieces is lost (transferred to the other player in case of capture). Players may also switch the color of their initial army through &quot;regime change&quot;. By Mark Bates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/sovereign-chess |last=Bates |first=Mark |title=Sovereign Chess |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]] |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thrones Chess''': Uses a board that combines a circular component and a square component, which allows long-range pieces to attack from three sides. The board is divided into two castles and a battlefield. A piece cannot cross more than two castle walls in the same move, and a king in check may not leave a castle except to capture the piece giving check. Knights have additional non-capturing moves. By Richard Van de Venter (1999).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.throneschess.com/|title=Thrones Chess, a Chess Variant played on CirSquare Board perfect combination of Circular and Square Boards|last=Van Deventer|first=Richard|date=2009|website=Thrones Chess Games|url-status=live|archive-date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Thrones Chess initial setup.png|alt=|thumb|Thrones Chess, initial setup with the classic chess pieces. Free squares may be filled by additional classic or fairy chess pieces.]]
* {{anchor|Troy}}'''Troy''': A variant inspired by the [[Trojan War]] played on a 91-cell hexagonal board. Pieces are named after characters from the myth.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=206|ps=}}
* '''Zonal chess''': Board has triangular wings or &quot;zones&quot; on either side of the main 8×8 board. Queens, bishops, and rooks that start from one of the squares in either zone may change direction and keep going on the same move. A queen, for example, could zig around an obstruction and attack a piece in the opposite zone. The power to change direction only applies when a piece's move starts from a zonal area. It is possible (using the queen and rook) to cross the board from one zone to another, but any piece entering a zone cannot make use of the extended move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/shape.dir/zonal/zonal.html &quot;Zonal Chess&quot;] by Larry Smith, ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unorthodox rules using nontraditional pieces===

====Nontraditional (fairy) pieces on a standard 8×8 board====
Most of the pieces in these variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess; however, these variants include one or more [[fairy pieces]] which move differently from chess pieces.

 |'''Anti-king chess'''. The [[Fairy chess piece#Anti-King|anti-king]] is shown as an inverted king.
}}
* '''Anti-King chess''': Features an anti-king. This piece is in check when not attacked. If a player's anti-king is in check and unable to move to a square attacked by the opponent, the player loses (checkmate). The anti-king cannot capture enemy pieces, but can capture friendly pieces. A king may not attack the opponent's anti-king. The anti-king may not check its own king. Other rules the same as in standard chess, including check and checkmate to the regular king. By Peter Aronson (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffobjective.dir/anti-king-chess.html Anti-King chess] by Peter Aronson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two setups were suggested by the inventor initially, but only the second one (Anti-King II), which is very close to standard chess gained popularity.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Baroque chess]]''' (or '''Ultima'''): Pieces on the first row move like queens, and pieces on the second row move like rooks. They are named after their unusual capturing methods. For example, leaper, immobilizer and coordinator.
* '''[[Berolina chess]]''': Which uses the Berolina pawn instead of the normal pawn, all other things being equal.
* '''[[Chess with different armies]]''': Two sides use different sets of fairy pieces. There are several armies of approximately equal strength to choose from including the standard FIDE chess army.
* '''[[Falcon-Hunter Chess]]''': A falcon moves forward as a bishop; backward as a rook. The hunter moves forward as a rook; backward as a bishop. Players introduce the fairies as the game progresses. By Karl Schulz (1943).
* '''[[Grasshopper chess]]''': The pawns can promote to grasshopper, or grasshoppers are on the board in the initial position.
* '''[[Pocket Mutation Chess]]''': Player can put a piece temporarily into the pocket, optionally mutating it into another (including fairy) piece.
*'''Super X Chess''': Players can combine their own pieces by capturing them. King or queen can't combine. A combined piece has the ability to move as both pieces that got combined. Same kind of pieces can combine into new pieces. Pieces can't uncombine or combine again.  By Miika Pihkala (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linuxgameconsortium.com/linux-gaming-news/super-x-chess-releases-tomorrow-steam-linux-70820/|title=Super X Chess releases tomorrow on Steam|date=2018-10-23|website=Linux Game Consortium|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Spartan chess''': Black (the Spartans) has an army headed by two kings, which otherwise consists exclusively of unorthodox pieces, and battles the standard FIDE army (the Persians) of white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartanchessonline.com/] by Steven Streetman.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Torpedo chess''': Which uses the torpedo pawn, which can move two squares forwards anywhere on the board, instead of the normal pawn, all other things being equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nenad Tomašev, Ulrich Paquet, Demis Hassabis, Vladimir Kramnik|title=Assessing Game Balance with AlphaZero: Exploring Alternative Rule Sets in Chess|year=2020|arxiv=2009.04374|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Anchor|Way of the Knight}}'''Way of the Knight''': Invented by [[Ralph Betza]], incorporating two elements from [[tabletop role-playing game]]s. Begins with the standard starting position and pieces, however through capturing and advancing up the board pieces can earn &quot;[[Experience point|experience]]&quot;, and a sufficiently experienced piece is upgraded to a more powerful one. Upgrades include various fairy pieces, and involve player choices of &quot;[[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/wotn.html|title=Way of the Knight|website=chessvariants.com|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/crossover.dir/wotnsample.html|title=A Sample game of Way of the Knight|last=Trenholme|first=Sam|website=chessvariants.com|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Empress, amazon, or princess pieces=====
There are a number of variants which use the [[Empress (chess)|empress]] (rook + knight) and [[Princess (chess)|princess]] (bishop + knight) compound pieces. The empress is also called marshall or chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/rook-knight.html The Piececlopedia: The Rook-Knight Compound] by Fergus Duniho and David Howe.&lt;/ref&gt; The princess is also called cardinal, archbishop, janus, paladin, or minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/bishop-knight.html The Piececlopedia: Bishop-Knight Compound] by Fergus Duniho and David Howe.&lt;/ref&gt; Another compound piece is the [[Amazon (chess)|amazon]] (queen + knight). To adapt to the new pieces, the board is usually extended to 10×8 or 10×10 with additional pawns added.&lt;ref name=&quot;material power in variant chess games&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess960-chess-variants/comparison-of-material-power-in-variant-chess-games|title=Comparison of Material Power in Variant-Chess Games - Chess Forums|website=Chess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Almost Chess]]''': Uses an 8×8 board, with the conventional starting position, but queens are replaced by chancellors (empresses). By Ralph Betza (1977). A related variant is '''[[Sort of Almost Chess]]''' (Ralph Betza, 1994), where one player has a queen and the other has a chancellor.
[[File:Grand Chess init config.PNG|thumb|238x238px|'''[[Grand Chess]]''' by Christian Freeling|alt=|center]]
* '''[[Capablanca Chess]]''': A variant by the former world chess champion, [[José Raúl Capablanca]]. Played on a 10×8 board with chancellor (empress) and archbishop (princess).
* '''[[Capablanca Random Chess]]''': Generalises all possible variants of [[Capablanca Chess]] with random starting positions following a method similar to that used in [[Chess960]]. By Reinhard Scharnagl (2004). 
* '''[[Embassy Chess]]''': Uses a 10×8 board with Marshall (Empress) and Cardinal (Princess). The starting position is borrowed from [[Grand Chess]]. By Kevin Hill (2005).
* '''Gothic chess''': A commercial variant played on a 10×8 board with Chancellor (Empress) and Archbishop (Princess).
* '''[[Grand Chess]]''': Uses a 10×10 board with marshall (empress) and cardinal (princess). Invented by [[Christian Freeling]] (1984).
* '''[[Janus Chess]]''': Uses a 10×8 board with two januses (princesses). By Werner Schöndorf (1978).
*'''Gemini Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musketeerchess.net/games/gemini/rules/rules.php|title=Gemini Chess Variant|date=2016|website=Musketeer Chess and Chess Variants|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses a 10x8 board with two Archbishops (Notation : Ar). From an idea of Dr Zied Haddad in 2016. The difference from Janus Chess is the initial setup where the archbishops are sandwiching the queen and king remaining in the center of the board. Initial setup is: RNBArQKArBNR. [[File:Gemini-setup.png|alt=|center|thumb|Gemini Chess initial position. The archbishops surround the queen and king from each side.]]
* '''[[Maharajah and the Sepoys]]''': Black has a complete army, and White only one piece: the maharajah (amazon).
* '''[[Modern Chess (chess variant)|Modern Chess]]''': Played on a 9×9 board, with an extra pawn and a prime minister (princess). By Gabriel Vicente Maura (1968).
* '''[[Seirawan Chess]]''': A commercial variant. Uses a standard 8×8 board with elephant (empress) and hawk (princess).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seirawanchess.com/|title=Seirawan chess &amp;#124; Yasser Seirawan|website=seirawanchess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Grandmaster (chess)|GM]] [[Yasser Seirawan]] and [[Bruce Harper]] (2007).
*'''Musketeer Chess''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musketeerchess.net/|title=Musketeer Chess, a modern Chess Variant|website=Musketeer Chess &amp; Chess Variants}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commercial variant, inspired from [[Seirawan Chess]]. This variant introduces 10 fairy pieces: archbishop, chancellor, hawk (different rules from Seirawan Chess), elephant (different rules from Seirawan Chess), leopard, cannon (different from Xiangqi), unicorn, fortress, spider, and amazon (also called dragon in this game). Players have a choice of 2 pieces among the 10 possible and method used to introduce them during the game.

=====Other unorthodox pieces=====
The pieces in these variants are borrowed from both chess and another game. The game goal and rules are either the same or very similar to those in chess. However, these variants include one or more [[fairy pieces]] which move differently from chess pieces.
* '''Chessers''': Played on a regular chessboard but with [[Draughts|checkers]] integrated with standard chess pieces. By Christopher Schwartz and Sander Beckers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://schwartztronica.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/checkmate-by-checkers/|title=Checkmate by Checkers|date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Playing cards on a chessboard''': A card game allowing open play on a board with rectangular sectors, just as in chess or [[Draughts|checkers]], but with the application of playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cardgameopen.64g.ru/en.htm,|title=Playing card games on a chess board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Prince &amp; Princess''': The chess variant that uses the criterion of succession, where the king or queen are replaced in favor of the prince or the princess, created by [[Antonio Maravi Oyague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profemaravi.blogspot.com/2015/07/chess-10x10-succession-prince-princess.html], &quot;Succession Chess&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Proteus''': A chess variant using dice to represent normal chess pieces, created by [[Steve Jackson Games]].{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=304}}

====Unorthodox pieces using unorthodox boards====
* '''Bomberman chess''': Inspired by the ''[[Bomberman]]'' video game series. Played on a 10×8 board with special bomb and defuser pieces. The bomb can be exploded on its turn in vertical and horizontal directions (similar to the movement of a rook), destroying any pieces in the blast range. The defuser can capture a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest/bomberman.html|title=Bomberman Chess|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chesquerque]]''': Played on four [[Alquerque]] boards combined. Includes an extra pawn and [[Princess (chess)|archbishop]] per side. By George Dekle Sr. 	
* '''Chess on an Infinite plane''': One type of [[infinite chess]]. Seventy-six pieces are played on an unbounded chessboard. The game uses orthodox chess pieces, plus [[Mann (chess)#History|guards]], [[Fairy chess piece#H|hawks]], and [[Empress (chess)|chancellors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/chess-on-an-infinite-plane Chess on an Infinite Plane] game rules&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of borders makes pieces effectively less powerful (as the king and other pieces cannot be trapped in corners), so the added material helps compensate for this.&lt;ref name=&quot;material power in variant chess games&quot;/&gt; Despite the infinite playing area, mathematical investigations have shown that in a general endgame, one player can force a win in a finite number of moves.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brumleve, Joel David Hamkins, Philipp Schlicht, The Mate-in-n Problem of Infinite Chess Is Decidable, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 7318, 2012, pp. 78-88, Springer [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30870-3_9], available at {{ArXiv|1201.5597}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a sub-variant which uses the [[Fairy chess piece#H|huygens]], possibly making the game mathematically undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/trappist-1  Chess on an Infinite Plane with Huygens Option] game rules&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chess on a Really Big Board]]''': Played on a 16×16 board, with twelve piece types (six being the orthodox chess pieces). Has many subvariants, including a larger 24×24 version and a three-dimensional 16×16×16 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/16x16.html|title=Chess on a Really Big Board}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Metamachy''': On a 12×12 board with 30 pieces each, 12 piece types (6 being the orthodox chess pieces) and 12 possible starting arrangements. New pieces are the cannon and the elephant (like in Shako), the prince (a non-royal king, can be promoted), the camel (long range leaper), the lion (any 1 or 2 squares) and the eagle (inspired by Tamerlane chess). By Jean-Louis Cazaux (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/metamachy Metamachy]''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Omega chess]]''': On a 10×10 board with four extra squares, one per corner. Includes the champion and wizard fairy pieces. Both are leapers, with different ways of leaping.
* '''Shako''': Played on a 10×10 board. New pieces are the cannon from [[xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) and an elephant moving as a fers+alfil of old [[shatranj]] (ancestors of queen and bishop), so diagonally one or two squares with jumps allowed. By Jean Louis-Cazaux (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/shako.html Shako] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parallel Worlds Chess init config.png|right|upright 1.3|thumb|[[Parallel Worlds Chess]], a 3D variant]]
{{Main|Three-dimensional chess}}
A number of variants have been developed where the playing area is in three [[dimension]]s or more. In most cases an extra spatial dimension is represented by multiple boards being laid next to each other. Some extra-dimensional variants attempt to reflect the 3D nature of modern warfare (e.g. ''[[Raumschach]]'', designed to reflect [[Aerial warfare|aerial]] and [[submarine warfare]]), while others incorporate fantasy or science fiction ideas such as [[Multiverse|parallel worlds]] and [[time travel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel Press Kit|url=https://www.5dchesswithmultiversetimetravel.com/presskit.html|access-date=2020-07-27|website=5dchesswithmultiversetimetravel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prichard (2007) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter is the 2020 computer game ''[[5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel|5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel]]''.

Similar to [[Patience (game)|solitaire]], there are a few chess variants for a single player. Unlike [[chess puzzle]]s, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these are similar to [[Mathematical chess problem#Permutation problems|permutation chess problems]], for example the game '''Queen's Quadrille''', which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/quadrille.html|title=Queen's Quadrille|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4×4 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen along a predetermined pattern; for example from one corner to the other, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game '''Hippodrome''', which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/hippodrome.html|title=Hippodrome|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.

In 1998 Robinson also invented a game which Hans Bodlaender named '''Chess Contradance''', as the setup is like a contradance with the two lines facing each other.  The pieces are set up as in regular chess, but without pawns. The first and eighth ranks are safe havens, i.e., no piece can be captured on these ranks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the pieces such that all pieces move to the opposite back row without ever putting any piece in danger of being captured. Black and White alternate moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/squaredance.html|title=Chess Contradance|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants for more than two people {{anchor|Multiplayer variants}}===
[[File:Bughouse game.jpg|right|thumb|275px|'''[[Bughouse chess]]''', the game in progress]]
* '''[[Bosworth (game)|Bosworth]]''': A four-player variant played on 6×6 board. It uses a special card system with the pieces for spawning.
* '''[[Bughouse chess]]''' (or '''Exchange chess''', '''Siamese chess''', '''Swap chess''', '''Tandem chess''', '''Transfer Chess'''): Two teams of two players face each other on two boards. Allies use opposite colours and give captured pieces to their partner. The two-player version of the game, played with only one board, is [[Crazyhouse]].
* '''[[Business chess]]''': Played with two teams using normal chess playing rules but allowing up to five variations of the game. The team may discuss and play alternative moves freely.
* '''[[Djambi]]''': Can be played by four players on a 9×9 board and four sets of special pieces. Pieces can capture or move those of an adversary. Captured pieces are not removed from the board, but turned upside down. There are variants for three or five players (''Pentachiavel''). (1975)
* '''[[Enochian chess]]''': A four-player variant with magical symbolism, associated with the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].
* '''[[Forchess]]''': A four-player variant using the standard board and two sets of standard pieces.
* '''[[Fortress chess]]''': A four-player variant played in Russia in 18th and 19th centuries.
* '''[[Four-player chess]]''' (or  '''Four-handed''', '''Four-man''', '''Four-way chess'''): Can be played by four people and uses a special board and four sets of differently coloured pieces.
* '''[[Quatrochess]]''': A four-player variant, in addition to the standard chess army, each side controls a chancellor, archbishop, mann, wazir, fers, two camels, and two giraffes. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Three-Man Chess]]''': Three chessboard halves fused into one, first to checkmate wins. By George Dekle Sr.
* '''[[Three-player chess]]''': A family of variants specially designed for three players.
* '''[[Tri-Chess]]''': For three players; 150 triangular cells; [[Empress (chess)|chancellor]] (empress) and [[Princess (chess)|cardinal]] (princess) replacing queen. By George Dekle Sr.

===Games inspired by chess===
These variants are very different from chess and may be classified as [[Abstract strategy game|abstract strategy]] [[board game]]s instead of chess variants.
* '''[[Arimaa]]''': A game designed in 2002 to be easy for people to understand but difficult for computers to play well. The [[Arimaa#Arimaa Challenge|Arimaa Challenge]] was a cash prize offered for developing a program able to defeat the top human Arimaa players; this was claimed in 2015.
*[[Hive (game)|'''Hive''']]: a bug-themed [[abstract strategy]] game designed by John Yianni and published in 2001 by Gen42 Games. The object of ''Hive'' is to capture the opponent's queen bee by completely surrounding it, while avoiding the capture of one's own queen.
* '''[[Martian chess]]''': Played with [[Icehouse pieces]].
* '''[[Navia Dratp]]''': A cross between [[shogi]] and [[miniature wargaming]].
* '''[[The Duke (board game)|The Duke]]''': An abstract strategy game where the board, pieces, and gameplay mechanics have some strong parallels with chess.
* '''[[Trxilt]]''': A game that combines some elements of Chess with some elements of Dots and Boxes.
[[File:Turnover Chess Variant.png|thumb|Turnover Chess Variant Board]]
* '''[[Turnover Chess]]''': An abstract strategy game, based on [[Reversi]]'s turning pieces ability and moves based on [[Chess]] moves, with only three different kind of pieces, an external and internal ring and a main button, with pieces double-sided in white and black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/invention/turnover|title=Turnover|website=chessvariants.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/302586/turnover-chess|title=Turnover Chess|website=boardgamegeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindsports.nl/index.php/dagaz/822-turnover-ai|title=Turnover AI|website=mindsports.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://luciofilho.github.io|title=Turnover: Super C variant|website=https://luciofilho.github.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess-related historical and regional games==
Some of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=H. J. R. |author-link=H. J. R. Murray | title=A History of Chess
|publisher=Benjamin Press (originally published by Oxford University Press)| year=1913 | isbn=978-0-936317-01-4|title-link=A History of Chess }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.

{{short description|Bishop of higher rank in many Christian denominations}}
[[File:Miguel de Poblete y Casasola.jpg|thumb|[[Miguel de Poblete Casasola]], [[Archbishop of Manila]] (1649-1667)]]
In [[Christianity]], an '''archbishop''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|tʃ|ˈ|b|ɪ|ʃ|ə|p}}, via [[Latin]] ''archiepiscopus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αρχιεπίσκοπος}}, from {{lang|grc|αρχι}}-, 'chief', and {{lang|grc|επί}} 'over'+{{lang|grc|σκοπος}} 'seer')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rxiepi/skopos|ἀρχιεπίσκοπος}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/skopos1|ἐπίσκοπος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|archiepiscopus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=archbishop|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=archbishop&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bishop]] of higher rank or office. In some cases, such as the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]], the title is borne by the leader of the denomination. Like [[pope]]s, [[patriarch]]s, [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]], [[cardinal bishop]]s, [[diocesan bishop]]s, and [[suffragan bishop]]s, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional [[Holy Orders|orders]] of bishops, [[priest#In Christianity|priests]] (also called [[presbyter]]s), and [[deacon]]s. An archbishop may be granted the title or [[ordination|ordained]] as chief pastor of a [[metropolitan see]] or  another [[episcopal see]] to which the title of archbishop is attached.

==Early history==
The earliest appearance of neither the title nor the role can be traced. The title of &quot;metropolitan&quot; was apparently well known by the 4th century, when there are references in the canons of the [[First Council of Nicæa]] of 325 and [[Synods of Antioch|Council of Antioch of 341]], though the term seems to be used generally for all higher ranks of bishop, including patriarchs.  The term &quot;archbishop&quot; does not appear in the modern sense until the 6th century, although the role, above ordinary bishops but below patriarchs, seems to be established for metropolitans by the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Archbishop|first=Sebastian Gebhard |last=Messmer|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western Christianity==
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}

===Metropolitan archbishops===
{{Main|Metropolitan bishop}}
{{See also|Diocesan bishop}}
Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which one see's bishop has certain powers and duties of oversight over the others. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the [[Catholic Church]], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law] indicates what these powers and duties are for a [[Latin Church]] metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (''[[sui iuris]]'') [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] are indicated in [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_PJ.HTM canon 157] of the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].  All Catholic metropolitans are archbishops, but not all archbishops are metropolitans, though most are.

===Non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees===
As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2012&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1142}} In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as [[Luxembourg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2012&quot; /&gt;{{rp|423}} or [[Monaco]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2012&quot; /&gt;{{rp|474}} too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.

Some of these archdioceses are [[suffragan diocese|suffragans]] of a metropolitan archdiocese; examples are the [[Archdiocese of Avignon]], which is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Marseille]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/davig.html|title=Avignon (Latin (or Roman) Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|access-date=2019-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archdiocese of Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]. Others are immediately subject to the Holy See and not to any metropolitan archdiocese. These are usually &quot;aggregated&quot; to an ecclesiastical province. An example is the [[Archdiocese of Hobart]] in [[Australia]], {{em| associated}} with the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Melbourne|ecclesiastical province of Melbourne]], but not {{em|part}} of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2012&quot; /&gt;{{rp|296}} The ordinary of such an archdiocese is an archbishop.

In the [[Anglican Communion]], non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees are much less common. The [[Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem]], established in 1841, was raised to the status of a non-metropolitan archiepiscopal see in 1957, but reduced to the status of an ordinary bishopric again in 1976. In 2014 it was again elevated to the status of non-metropolitan archbishopric, with its ordinary bearing the title &quot;Archbishop in Jerusalem&quot;, despite having no ex officio right to be the metropolitan of the province.&lt;ref name=jmeca&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.jmeca.org.uk/christianity-middle-east/anglican-episcopal-church/jerusalem/brief-history-diocese-jerusalem |title = A Brief History of the Diocese of Jerusalem |last= |first= |author= |date= |year= |editor-last= |editor-first= |publisher = The Jerusalem and the Middle East Church Association |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status=live |access-date = 26 June 2020 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acjer&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese.aspx?church=middle-east&amp;dio=jerusalem |title = Archbishop in Jerusalem |last= |first= |author= |date= 17 June 2020|year= |editor-last= |editor-first= |publisher = Anglican Communion |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status=live |access-date = 26 June 2020 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coadjutor archbishops===
{{Main|Coadjutor bishop}}
Until 1970, a coadjutor archbishop, one who has special faculties and the right to succeed to the leadership of a see on the death or resignation of the incumbent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1E.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned also to a [[titular see]], which he held until the moment of succession. Since then, the title of Coadjutor Archbishop of the see is considered sufficient and more appropriate.

===Archbishops ''ad personam''===
The rank of archbishop is conferred on some bishops who are not ordinaries of an archdiocese. They hold the rank not because of the see that they head but because it has been granted to them personally (''ad personam''). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a see that, though its present-day importance may be greater than the person's former see, is not archiepiscopal. The bishop transferred is then known as the Archbishop-Bishop of his new see. An example is [[Gianfranco Gardin]], appointed Archbishop-Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Treviso|Treviso]] on 21 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ofmconv.pcn.net/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=294:naming-of-the-archbishop-bishop-of-treviso-italy&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=87|title=Friars Minor Conventual - Naming of the Archbishop-Bishop of Treviso, Italy|website=www2.ofmconv.pcn.net|access-date=2019-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title borne by the successor of such an archbishop-bishop is merely that of Bishop of the see, unless he also is granted the personal title of Archbishop.

===Titular archiepiscopal sees===
The distinction between metropolitan sees and non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees exists for [[titular see]]s as well as for residential ones. The ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' marks titular sees of the former class with the abbreviation ''Metr.'' and the others with ''Arciv.''&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2012&quot; /&gt;{{rp|819}}

Many of the titular sees to which [[nuncio]]s and heads of departments of the Roman Curia who are not cardinals are assigned are not of archiepiscopal rank. In that case the person who is appointed to such a position is given the personal title of archbishop (''ad personam''). They are usually referred to as Archbishop of the see, not as its Archbishop-Bishop.

===Archbishops emeriti===
If an archbishop resigns his see without being transferred to another, as in the case of retirement or assignment to head a department of the [[Roman Curia]], the word ''[[emeritus]]'' is added to his former title, and he is called Archbishop Emeritus of his former see. Until 1970, such archbishops were transferred to a titular see.

There can be several Archbishops Emeriti of the same see: The 2008 ''Annuario Pontificio'' listed three living Archbishops Emeriti of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei|Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2008, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no Archbishop Emeritus of a titular see: An archbishop who holds a titular see keeps it until death or until transferred to another see.

In the [[Anglican Communion]], retired archbishops formally revert to being addressed as &quot;bishop&quot; and styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/contact-us/addressingtheclergy.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117080143/https://www.churchofengland.org/contact-us/addressingtheclergy.aspx|archive-date=2011-11-17|website=Church of England website|title=Addressing the Clergy|quote=See note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they may be appointed &quot;archbishop emeritus&quot; by their province on retirement, in which case they retain the title &quot;archbishop&quot; and the style &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;, as a right.&lt;ref&gt;See the example of [http://anglicancentre.churchinsight.com/Groups/199808/Anglican_Centre_in/Contacts_Our_story/Director_and_Staff/The_Director_Archbishop/The_Director_Archbishop.aspx Archbishop David Moxon], for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is a prominent example, as Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town.

While there is no difference between the official dress of archbishops, as such, and that of other bishops, Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishops are distinguished by the use in liturgical ceremonies of the [[pallium]], but only within the province over which they have oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com|access-date=2019-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; in most cases. In [[English-speaking]] countries (except the United States), a Catholic archbishop is addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, while a Catholic bishop is addressed as &quot;Your Lordship&quot;. Before December 12, 1930, the title &quot;Most Reverend&quot; was only for archbishops, while bishops were styled as &quot;Right Reverend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Canon Law Digest,'' Bouscaren, Vol. 1, Page 20.

In Roman Catholic [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldry]], an archbishop has an ecclesiastical hat called a [[galero]] with ten tassels on each side of his [[coat of arms]], while a bishop has only six. The archiepiscopal cross behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.

In processions and other occasions where strict protocol is observed, archbishops are ranked higher than [[diocesan bishop]]s in the [[Order of precedence in the Catholic Church|order of precedence]].

In the [[Anglican Communion]], archbishops are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;, while bishops are styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot; and addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;Your Lordship&quot;. (In some countries, this usage is followed also by the Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and &quot;The Most Reverend&quot; and &quot;Your Excellency&quot; are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions.&lt;ref&gt;This Anglican [http://library.episcopalchurch.org/gallery/episcopal-news-service-archives?page=2#content news agency page] has photographs of two-barred crosses being carried by Archbishop George Carey and by Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.&lt;ref&gt;The primatial cross is illustrated at the [http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2315 London SE1] community website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Christianity==
[[File:Archbishop Christodoulos Greece.jpg|upright|thumb|Archbishop [[Christodoulos of Athens]] and All Greece (1998–2008)]]
Archbishops exist in all traditional denominations of the [[Eastern Christianity]], including [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and others.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{main|Bishop in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], the office and title of archbishop can be traced from the 4th and 5th century. Historically, the title was used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|p=}} In some Eastern Orthodox Churches, archbishops are ranked above [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] in [[Order of precedence|precedence]], while in others that order is reversed. Primates of [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] Eastern Orthodox Churches below [[patriarch]]al rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in [[Order of precedence|precedence]]. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox Churches ([[Russian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox]]) and also for [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], where metropolitans rank above archbishops.

In terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of archbishops in the Eastern Orthodox Church: real archbishops, and honorary archbishops. Real archbishops are primates of autocephalous or autonomous (regional) churches, and they have actual jurisdiction over other bishops, while honorary archbishops are in fact just [[diocesan bishops]] with honorary titles of archbishops and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese. The honorary title is usually conferred to bishops of historically important [[Episcopal see|sees]]. For example, in the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], both types are represented: head of the autonomous [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric]] is styled ''Archbishop of Ohrid'' and invested with regional jurisdiction over all diocesan bishops in [[North Macedonia]], while diocesan bishop of the [[Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral]], with seat in [[Cetinje]], is given only the honorary title ''Archbishop of Cetinje'', but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in [[Montenegro]].

== Functions ==
Rabbis serve the Jewish community. Hence their functions vary as the needs of the Jewish community vary over time and from place to place.

; Study and teaching: Rabbis have always been the main links in the chain of transmission (''masorah'') whereby knowledge of the Torah has been passed down through the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, Avot, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning from their teachers, adding new insights of their own (''hidushim''), and teaching the public have always been the primary functions of the rabbinate. Studying the Torah is a rabbi's lifelong undertaking that does not end with receiving ordination. A rabbi is expected to set aside time daily for study. A rabbi that does not constantly replenish his or her store of Torah learning will lack the knowledge, inspiration and mastery of Jewish law and traditions required to perform all other rabbinic functions.
:Once acquired, Torah knowledge must be passed on, because it is the heritage of all Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy 33]]:4.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching by rabbis occurs in many venues—the schoolroom of course, elementary (''heder''), intermediate (''yeshivah'') and advanced (''kollel''), but also, especially in antiquity, in the vineyard, the marketplace and the disciple circle.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Goodblatt, ''Rabbinic Instruction In Sasanian Babylonia,'' Brill, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[synagogue]]s, the rabbi will give a short daily class to those who attend morning or evening services. The sermon is another form of public education, often integrating Biblical passages with a contemporary ethical message,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Saperstein, ''Jewish Preaching,'' Yale, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and no Jewish meal or celebration is complete without the rabbi's &quot;''d'var Torah''&quot;—a short explanation of Biblical verses related to the event.
:Apart from face to face instruction, rabbis who are inclined to authorship have composed an extensive [[rabbinic literature]], dealing with all aspects of the Jewish tradition—Bible commentaries, codes of law, responsa, mystical and ethical tracts, and collections of sermons are examples of common genres of rabbinic literature.
; Judging: Prior to emancipation, rulers delegated discipline and dispute settlement within the Jewish community (''kahal'') to the Jewish community itself. If a dispute, domestic or commercial, a tort or a petty crime, involved only Jewish residents, then it could be settled in the town's Jewish court according to Jewish law. The town rabbi, with his extensive knowledge of Torah law (''halakhah''), was expected to preside as Head of the Court (''av beth din''),&lt;ref&gt;S. Schwarzfuchs, ''Concise History of the Rabbinate,'' 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;51-53.&lt;/ref&gt; although lay assessors might join him in judgment. The judgments were enforced with fines and various degrees of communal excommunication when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5933-excommunication |title= Excommunication - JewishEncyclopedia.com |website= www.jewishencyclopedia.com |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170220180034/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5933-excommunication |archivedate= February 20, 2017 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:After emancipation, Jews, as citizens of their countries, turned to civil courts for dispute resolution. Today rabbinical courts remain active under the auspices of each Jewish denomination for religious matters, such as conversion and divorce, and even, on a voluntary basis, for civil matters when the parties voluntarily elect to have the rabbinical judges serve as their arbitrators.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rabbinical Courts: Modern Day Solomons,&quot; 6 Colum J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 49 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel there are rabbinical courts for matters of personal status.
; Legislating: During the centuries of Jewish self-government, some problems were considered regional or universal and could not be solved by a single rabbi acting alone. At these times rabbinical synods were convened for concerted action, calling together the prominent rabbis of the region to debate solutions and enact binding regulations (''[[takkanot]]'') for their communities. The regulations involved matters as diverse as dowries and matrimonial law, relations with gentiles, utilizing civil courts, education of orphans, anti-counterfeiting measures, and the hiring of schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14204-takkanah |title= TaḲḲanah - JewishEncyclopedia.com |website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108185942/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14204-takkanahb|archivedate=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these ordinances is ascribed to [[Rabbeinu Gershom]], and was probably enacted in a rabbinic synod he convened c. 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6615-gershom-ben-judah |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093912/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6615-gershom-ben-judah |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance, still in effect today, prohibits polygamy among Jews in the West.
:In the modern era rabbis have enacted ''takkanot'' in the State of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Dorff and Roset, ''A Living Tree,'' SUNY, 1988, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; and the major Jewish movements, such as Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist, enact ''takkanot'' for their members. Today most congregational rabbis are members of a national rabbinic organization related to their movement{{NoteTag|These include the Central Council of American Rabbis for Reform rabbis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://ccarnet.org/about-us/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108095325/https://ccarnet.org/about-us/ |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rabbinical Council of America for Orthodox rabbis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024095458/http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011129090316/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/ |archivedate=November 29, 2001 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and also an association of local rabbis in their city. When these bodies debate local and national questions, they function in a manner that is similar to the rabbinic synods of the past.
; Religious supervision: The Jewish community requires a number of religious institutions for daily life, and it falls to rabbis, with their knowledge of Jewish law, to supervise them to ensure they operate in accordance with Jewish law. Examples would be Jewish slaughter (''shekhita''), Jewish dietary laws in shops and institutions (''kashrut''), the ritual bath (''mikveh''), the elementary school (''heder''), the Sabbath boundaries (''eruvin''), and the burial society (''hevra kadisha''). Traditionally this function fell to the town's rabbi. In the modern era, rabbis who specialize in this type of supervision will find full-time employment as a [[Mashgiach]] (supervisor of ritual law), and some of these functions are now performed by national organizations, such as the Orthodox Union which offers kosher certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://oukosher.org/ |title=OU Kosher: Certification and Supervision by the Orthodox Union |website=OU Kosher Certification |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185202/https://oukosher.org/ |archivedate=December 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Pastoral counseling: In addition to answering questions about Jewish law and rituals, a congregational rabbi may often be consulted for advice on personal matters. Much of a modern rabbi's time is devoted to pastoral work, including visiting the sick and officiating at life cycle occasions.&lt;ref name=ej&gt;Rabbi, Rabbinate, article in the Encyclopaedia Judaica, 2nd ed., vol. 17, pp. 11–19, Keter Publishing, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-modern era, rabbis had no special training in counseling, relying instead on their personal qualities of empathy and caring. These factors continue to inform rabbinic advising in the modern era. However modern rabbinical seminaries have instituted courses in psychology and pastoral counseling as part of the required rabbinic curriculum and they offer internships in counseling and social services for their rabbinical students.&lt;ref name=ej/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf RCA Semicha Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Hasidic Jews, turning to the ''[[rebbe]]'' for advice on personal matters is common.
; Leading prayer services: Traditionally rabbis did not lead prayer services in the modern sense. There is no requirement that a rabbi be present for public prayer. The Jewish liturgy is fixed and printed in prayer books (''siddurim''), the vocal portions are chanted by a cantor (''hazan'') and the Torah portion is read by a trained reader (''ba'al koreh''). If the rabbi was present, he would be seated in front near the Ark and as a matter of respect, the pace at which the rabbi recited his prayers might set the pace of the service. If halakhic questions arose about the prayer service, the rabbi would answer them.
:In modern synagogues, the rabbi takes a more active role in leading prayer services. In some synagogues, it is permitted for the rabbi to select passages from the prayer book for public reading, to omit some passages for brevity and to add special prayers to the service. The rabbi may lead the congregation in responsive reading, announce page numbers and comment on the liturgy from time to time. At Sabbath and holiday services, the congregational rabbi will deliver a sermon either right before or right after the Torah is read.
; Celebrating life's events: Jewish law does not require the presence of a rabbi at a marriage, bar or bat mitzvah, circumcision, funeral, house of mourning, or unveiling of a monument at a cemetery. At the same time, Jewish law has prescribed requirements for each of these events and rituals. It therefore became customary for rabbis to be present and to lead the community in celebration and in mourning. In the modern era, it is virtually obligatory to have the rabbi's participation at these events, and ministering to the congregation in these settings has become a major aspect of the modern rabbinate.
:Jewish divorce, which requires a rabbinical court (''beth din''), will always have rabbis in attendance.
; Charitable works: The synagogue has been a place where charity is collected every weekday after services and then distributed to the needy before Sabbaths and holidays. It was not the rabbi who collected these sums; that task was assigned to the sexton, wardens of charity and charitable associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4248-charity-and-charitable-institutions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113105711/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4248-charity-and-charitable-institutions |archivedate=January 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was the rabbi's task to teach that charity (''tzedakah'') is a core Jewish value. The rabbi did this by preaching, teaching and by example—hosting poor out of town yeshiva students at the home table and offering Jewish travelers a kosher meal. [[Maimonides]] formulated a ladder consisting of eight degrees of charity, starting with reluctant giving and ending with teaching someone a trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Levels_of_Giving.html |title=Eight Levels of Charitable Giving |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170112135746/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Levels_of_Giving.html |archivedate=January 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Israel Salanter]] (1809-1883) was once asked, &quot;How do you provide for your spiritual needs?&quot; He answered, &quot;By providing for someone else's physical needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rabbisacks.org/credo-someone-elses-material-needs-are-my-spiritual-responsibility/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113131747/http://www.rabbisacks.org/credo-someone-elses-material-needs-are-my-spiritual-responsibility/ |archivedate=January 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Today Jewish federations and foundations collect and distribute most charity within the Jewish community. However the rabbi retains the task of teaching the value of charity and often participates personally in appeals for the synagogue and for national and international causes.
; Role-modeling: The rabbi serves as a role model for the congregation by his or her conduct and deportment. Congregation members are keen observers of their rabbi's personality traits, family life, professional conduct, leisure activities and in general the way he or she treats others. Rabbis are aware of this and in the best case deliberately model their conduct so that it represents Jewish values to the community and to outsiders.
:This aspect of the rabbinate, setting an example for the public, has a direct application in Jewish law. The way the greatest rabbis and Torah scholars conducted themselves can become a precedent in Jewish law, known as ''ma'aseh.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12945.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160605031854/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12945.html |archivedate=June 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, based on reports of what rabbis did in the Talmud, [[Maimonides]] ruled that one engaged in public affairs should not break off his duties to recite certain prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Kri'at Shema 2:5.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Outreach, also known as ''kiruv'' (bringing close): Some rabbis program and guide activities designed to reach Jews who are unaffiliated with Judaism or lapsed in their observances. These include &quot;Beginners' Services&quot; where the Jewish liturgy is shortened and explained, and Shabbatons, where unaffiliated Jews are hosted by an observant family during Sabbath to experience the day in a religious setting and to learn about its rituals and customs. [[Chabad outreach]] sends many rabbis and their wives to be posted in Chabad Houses worldwide for the express purpose of reaching unaffiliated Jews.
; Conversions: Most rabbis will from time to time encounter someone who is not Jewish seeking information about Judaism or wishing to explore [[conversion to Judaism]]. This may happen when one member of a couple wishing to marry is seeking conversion or on other occasions when intermarriage is not involved. Based on the rabbi's training and assessment of the person's motivations and goals, the rabbi's approach may range from discouragement of the potential convert to mentoring and directing to a conversion class, in accordance with the policy on conversion of the rabbi's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/conversion-to-judaism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170126044405/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/conversion-to-judaism/ |archivedate=January 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One or three rabbis will serve on the ''beth din'' that performs a conversion. There are no rabbis serving as &quot;Jewish missionaries&quot; per se; there is no parallel in Judaism to the proselytizing of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |title = BBC - Religions - Judaism: Converting to Judaism |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201120016/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |archivedate=December 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Match-making: In periods when match-making was common, rabbis participated.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey I. Roth, ''Inheriting the Crown in Jewish Law,'' Univ. of So. Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 29, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis were well-acquainted with their community members and in particular with the young unmarried men attending their yeshivas. Parents did not hesitate to consult the rabbi for suitable matches. Today in Orthodox circles where socializing among the sexes is not common, this practice continues, and in all branches of Judaism, a rabbi who can help in this arena will not hesitate to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-16/local/me-4431_1_religious-persuasion |title = Rabbi Plays Cupid in Bid to Keep Faith Among Jews : Matchmaking: His concern that many are marrying non-Jews prompts him to establish dating service so that singles may find others of same religious persuasion |first=Kim |last=Halverson |date=February 16, 1992 |via=LA Times |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170116191008/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-16/local/me-4431_1_religious-persuasion |archivedate=January 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Synagogue administration: The modern synagogue is a non-profit religious corporation run by a Board of Directors elected by the members. However, on a day-to-day basis, board members are not present. In most synagogues, it is the rabbi's task to administer the synagogue, supervise personnel, manage the physical plant, review (if not write) the newsletter, and interact with the brotherhood, the sisterhood and the youth organizations. Very large synagogues may employ a separate administrator or assistant rabbi to perform some or all of these functions.
; Chaplaincy: [[File:USAF Jewish Chaplain Insignia.jpg|Air Force current Jewish Chaplain insignia, with Hebrew letters|thumb|upright|Jewish [[United States Air Force Chaplain Corps|chaplain]] insignia, U.S. Air Force]] Rabbis go into the field wherever members of the Jewish community may be found. This is most noticeable in the military services and on university campuses where some rabbis serve as Jewish chaplains on a full-time basis. All branches of the U. S. military have Jewish chaplains in their ranks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jcca.org/what-we-do/jwb/become-a-chaplain/ |title = Become a Chaplain: Serving Jews Who Serve - JCC Association |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093726/http://jcca.org/what-we-do/jwb/become-a-chaplain/ |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rabbis serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. The Hillel Foundation provides rabbis and Jewish services on 550 campuses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hillel.org/ |title=Hillel International - The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life at Colleges and Universities |website=hillel.org |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055441/http://www.hillel.org/ |archivedate=December 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chabad operates Jewish centers with a rabbi near 150 college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chabad.edu/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/387553/jewish/About.htm |title = About - Chabad on Campus International |website=www.chabad.edu |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093924/http://www.chabad.edu/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/387553/jewish/About.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local rabbis perform other chaplaincy functions on a part-time basis in hospitals, senior homes and prisons. Worthy of mention are the rabbis who accompanied Jews to concentration camps during the Nazi era; in dire circumstances they continued to provide rabbinic services, such as ritual observance, advice and counseling, to the victims of Nazi persecution, whenever it was possible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;See Irving Rosenbaum, ''The Holocaust and Halakah,'' Ktav, 1976, pp.&amp;nbsp;9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Public affairs: As leaders of the Jewish community, many rabbis devote a portion of their time to activities in the public arena, especially where Jewish interests are at stake. They dialogue with public officials and community groups, interact with school boards, advocate for and against legislation, engage in public debates, write newspaper columns, appear in the media and march in parades and demonstrations with others to show support for causes. The extent and tenor of these activities is dictated by the rabbi's own conscience and social and political leanings as informed by Jewish values.
; Defending the faith: Rabbis are often called upon to defend the Jewish faith. During the Middle Ages, the Church arranged a series of public [[disputation]]s between rabbis and priests that were intended to &quot;disprove&quot; the Jewish faith and condemn its religious texts, including the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5226-disputations |title = DISPUTATIONS - JewishEncyclopedia.com |website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150306212554/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5226-disputations |archivedate=March 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbis acquitted themselves well in debate with their superior understanding of Jewish texts and mass conversions to Christianity did not take place. However following these disputations local rulers at the Church's behest consigned cartloads of precious Hebrew manuscripts to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/TalmudBurning.html |title=Burning of the Talmud |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215024907/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/TalmudBurning.html |archivedate=December 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today rabbis are involved in countering the activities of missionaries aimed at converting Jews to other religions, explaining for example that one cannot be of the Jewish faith while believing in either the Christian God or the Christian messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aish.com/atr/Jews-for-J.html |title = Jews-for-J: Messiah &amp; Redemption Response on Ask the Rabbi |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170108094329/http://www.aish.com/atr/Jews-for-J.html |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Interfaith activities: Some rabbis engage in interfaith dialogues with clergy of other faiths. They may host student groups from the religious schools of other faiths and participate in interfaith services. They will view these activities as a means of deepening understanding and reducing misconceptions in a diverse society. Other rabbis, especially those affiliated with Orthodox Judaism, will generally not participate in interfaith dialogues about theology. They will however engage in discussions with the clergy of other faiths about matters of mutual social concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=scholar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021054/http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=scholar |archivedate=January 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Non-practicing rabbis: There is a segment of the rabbinate that does not engage in rabbinic functions on a daily basis, except perhaps to study. Because rabbinic ordination ([[Semikhah]]) has the features of a post-graduate academic degree, some study to receive ordination but then follow a different career in secular business, education or the professions. These rabbis may be asked from time to time to perform a rabbinic function on an ad hoc and voluntary basis, e.g. to perform a marriage ceremony or answer a religious question. At other times, they act as regular members of the Jewish community. No negative attitudes attach to rabbis who do not practice the profession. They are likely admired in their communities for their decision to spend years engaged in advanced Torah study for its own sake.

=== Compensation ===
In antiquity those who performed rabbinic functions, such as judging a case or teaching Torah to students, did not receive compensation for their services.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey I. Roth, ''Inheriting the Crown in Jewish Law: The Struggle for Rabbinic Compensation, Tenure and Inheritance Rights,'' Univ. of So. Carolina Press, 2006, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a rabbi was not a full-time profession and those who served had other occupations to support themselves and their families, such as woodchopper, sandal-maker, carpenter, water-carrier, farmer and tanner.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, {{cite web |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12494-rabbi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131102116/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12494-rabbi |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A respected scholar, Rabbi [[Zadok]] (1st cent. CE), had said &quot;never to use the Torah as a spade for digging,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Avot'' 4:5.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was understood to mean never to use one's Torah knowledge for an inappropriate purpose, such as earning a fee. Still, as honored members of the community, Torah sages were allowed a series of privileges and exemptions that alleviated their financial burdens somewhat. These included such things as tax exemption from communal levies,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bava Batra 7b-8a&quot;&gt;''Bava Batra'' 7b-8a&lt;/ref&gt; marketplace priority (first in, first out regarding their trade),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bava Batra 7b-8a&quot; /&gt; receiving personal services from their students (''shimush talmedei hakhamim''),&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 96a.&lt;/ref&gt; silent business partnerships with wealthy merchants,&lt;ref&gt;''Berakhot'' 34b,&lt;/ref&gt; and a substitute fee to replace their lost earnings when they had to leave work to perform a rabbinic function (''sekhar battalah'').&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Geonim]] (c. 650-1050 CE), opinions on compensation shifted. It was deemed inappropriate for the leaders of the Jewish community to appear in the marketplace as laborers or vendors of merchandise, and leading a Jewish community was becoming a full-time occupation. Under these conditions, the Geonim collected taxes and donations at home and abroad to fund their schools (''yeshivot'') and paid salaries to teachers, officials and judges of the Jewish community, whom they appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] (1135-1204), who supported himself as a physician, reasserted the traditional view of offering rabbinic service to the Jewish community without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah Torah, Talmud Torah'' 3:10; ''Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot'' 4:7.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the ideal. But circumstances had changed. Jewish communities required full-time rabbis, and the rabbis themselves preferred to spend their days studying and teaching Torah rather than working at a secular trade.

By the fifteenth century it was the norm for Jewish communities to compensate their rabbis, although the rabbi's contract might well refer to a &quot;suspension fee&quot; (''sekhar battalah'') rather than a salary, as if he were relinquishing a salary from secular employment.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of salaries varied, depending on the size of the community served, with rabbis in large cities being well-compensated while rabbis in small towns might receive a small stipend.&lt;ref&gt;Simha Assaf, ''LeKorot HaRabbanut,'' ''B'Ohalei Yaakov'' (Mosad HaRav Kook, 5703), pp.&amp;nbsp;46-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis were able to supplement their rabbinic incomes by engaging in associated functions and accepting fees for them, like serving as the community's scribe, notary and archivist, teaching in the elementary school or yeshivah, publishing books, arbitrating civil litigations, or even serving as a matchmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the formation of rabbinical seminaries starting in the nineteenth century, the rabbinate experienced a degree of professionalization that is still underway. At the present time, an ordained graduate of a rabbinical seminary that is affiliated with one of the modern branches of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, or modern Orthodox, will find employment—whether as a congregational rabbi, teacher, chaplain, Hillel director, camp director, social worker or administrator—through the placement office of his or her seminary. Like any modern professional, he or she will negotiate the terms of employment with potential employers and sign a contract specifying duties, duration of service, salary, benefits, pension and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbi's salary and benefits today tend to be similar to those of other modern professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, with similar levels of post-graduate education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2003/09/17/life-religion/features/different-denominations-same-pay|title=Different denominations, same pay|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102082824/http://www.jta.org/2003/09/17/life-religion/features/different-denominations-same-pay|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to engage in the rabbinate part-time, e.g. at a synagogue with a small membership; the rabbi's salary will be proportionate to the services rendered and he or she will likely have additional employment outside the synagogue.

===Authority===
Acceptance of rabbinic credentials involves both issues of practicality and principle. As a practical matter, communities and individuals typically tend to follow the authority of the rabbi they have chosen as their leader (called by some the ''mara d'atra'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=MARA DE-ATRA: A Brief Sketch |first=Aaron |last=Kirschenbaum |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=35–40 |jstor=23260883}}&lt;/ref&gt; on issues of Jewish law. They may recognize that other rabbis have the same authority elsewhere, but for decisions and opinions important to them they will work through their own rabbi.

The rabbi derives authority from achievements within a meritocratic system. Rabbis' authority is neither nominal nor spiritual — it is based on credentials. Typically the rabbi receives an institutional stamp of approval. It is this authority that allows them to engage in the halakhic process and make legal prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;John Corrigan, Frederick Denny, Martin S. Jaffee, and Carlos Eire. Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions. New York, NY: Routledge, 2012, 124-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The same pattern is true within broader communities, ranging from Hasidic communities to rabbinical or congregational organizations: there will be a formal or ''de facto'' structure of rabbinic authority that is responsible for the members of the community. However, Hasidic communities do not have a mere rabbi: they have a [[Rebbe]], who plays a similar role but is thought to have a special connection to God. The Rebbes' authority, then, is based on a spiritual connection to God and so they are venerated in a different way from rabbis.

===Honor===
According to the Talmud, it is a commandment (''[[mitzvah]]'') to honor a rabbi and a Torah scholar, along with the elderly, as it is written in Leviticus 19:32, &quot;Rise up before the elderly, and honor the aged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Kidushin daf 30–40, Bava Metziah 33a, Rambam's Mishneh Torah tractate Hilkhot Talmud Torah 5:7&lt;/ref&gt; One should stand in their presence and address them with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 5:7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kohen|Kohanim]] (priests) are required to honor rabbis and Torah scholars like the general public. However, if one is more learned than the rabbi or the scholar there is no need to stand. The spouse of a Torah scholar must also be shown deference.&lt;ref name=&quot;yutorah1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/746702/Rabbi_Hanan_Balk/The_Obligation_to_Respect_the_Wife_of_a_Torah_Scholar_or_a_Talmidat_Chacham |title = YUTorah Online – The Obligation to Respect the Wife of a Torah Scholar or a Talmidat Chacham (Rabbi Hanan Balk) |publisher=Yutorah.org |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607153904/http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/746702/Rabbi_Hanan_Balk/The_Obligation_to_Respect_the_Wife_of_a_Torah_Scholar_or_a_Talmidat_Chacham |archivedate=June 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a commandment for teachers and rabbis to honor their students.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 5:12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis and Torah scholars, in order to ensure discipline within the Jewish community, have the authority to place individuals who insult them under a ban of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 6:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination==
{{Main|Semikhah}}
{{See also|List of rabbinical schools}}
A rabbinical student is awarded ''semikhah'' (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of a learning program in a yeshiva or modern rabbinical seminary or under the guidance of an individual rabbi. The exact course of study varies by denomination, but most are in the range of 3–6 years. The programs all include study of Talmud, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]] to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the branch of Judaism. In addition to rabbinical literature, modern seminaries offer courses in pastoral subjects such as counseling, education, comparative religion and delivering sermons. Most rabbinical students will complete their studies in their mid-20s. There is no hierarchy and no central authority in Judaism that either supervises rabbinic education or records ordinations; each branch of Judaism regulates the ordination of the rabbis affiliated with it.

The most common formula used on a certificate of ''semikhah'' is ''Yore yore'' (&quot;He may teach, he may teach&quot;, sometimes rendered as a question and answer, &quot;May he teach? He may teach.&quot;). Most Rabbis hold this qualification; they are sometimes called a ''moreh hora'ah'' (&quot;a teacher of rulings&quot;). A more advanced form of ''semikhah'' is ''yadin yadin'' (&quot;He may judge, he may judge&quot; or &quot;May he judge? He may judge.&quot;). This enables the recipient to serve as a judge on a rabbinical court and adjudicate cases of monetary law, among other responsibilities. The recipient of this ordination can be formally addressed as a ''dayan'' (&quot;judge&quot;) and also retain the title of rabbi. Only a small percentage of rabbis earn the ''yadin yadin'' ordination. Although not strictly necessary, many Orthodox rabbis hold that a ''[[beth din]]'' (court of Jewish law) should be made up of ''dayanim'' with this ordination.

===Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism===
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Judaism of the second half of the twentieth century.]]

An Orthodox ''semikhah'' requires the successful completion of a program encompassing Jewish law and responsa in keeping with longstanding tradition. Orthodox rabbinical students work to gain knowledge in [[Talmud]], [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]] (early and late medieval commentators) and [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. They study sections of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (codified Jewish law) and its main commentaries that pertain to daily-life questions (such as the laws of keeping [[kosher]], [[Shabbat]], and the laws of [[Niddah|family purity]]). 
See: {{section link|Yeshiva#Talmud study}} and {{section link|Yeshiva#Jewish law}}; {{section link|Semikhah#Concept}}; {{section link|Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)}}.

Orthodox rabbis typically study at [[yeshiva]]s, which are dedicated religious schools. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] rabbinical students, such as those at [[Yeshiva University]], study some elements of modern theology or philosophy, as well as the classical rabbinic works on such subjects (see {{section link|Yeshiva#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy}}).

The entrance requirements for an Orthodox yeshiva include a strong background within Jewish law, liturgy, Talmudic study, and attendant languages (e.g., [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and in some cases [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]). Specifically, students are expected to have acquired [[Gemara#Argumentation and debate|deep analytic skills]], and breadth, in Talmud before commencing their rabbinic studies. At the same time, since rabbinical studies typically flow from other yeshiva studies, those who seek semichah are typically not required to have completed a university education. Exceptions exist, such as [[Yeshiva University]], which requires all rabbinical students to complete an undergraduate degree before entering the program, and a Masters or equivalent before ordination.

Historically, women could not become Orthodox rabbis. Starting in 2009, some Modern Orthodox institutions began ordaining women with the title of &quot;[[Maharat]]&quot;, and later with titles including &quot;Rabbah&quot; and &quot;Rabbi&quot;. This is currently a contested issue for many Orthodox institutions, leading some to seek alternate clerical titles and roles for women (see [[Women rabbis]], and [[Yoetzet Halacha]]).&lt;ref name=nadell2019/&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen2012/&gt;

While some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (including [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) [[yeshiva]]s (also known as &quot;Talmudical/Rabbinical schools or academies&quot;) do grant official ordination to many students wishing to become rabbis, most of the students within the yeshivas engage in [[Torah study|learning Torah]] or [[Talmud]] without the goal of becoming rabbis or holding any official positions. The curriculum for obtaining ordination as rabbis for Haredi scholars is the same as described above for all Orthodox students wishing to obtain the official title of &quot;Rabbi&quot; and to be recognized as such.

Within the Hasidic world, the positions of spiritual leadership are dynastically transmitted within established families, usually from fathers to sons, while a small number of students obtain official ordination to become [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]]im (&quot;judges&quot;) on [[Beth din|religious courts]], [[Posek|poskim]] (&quot;decisors&quot; of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]), as well as teachers in the Hasidic schools. The same is true for the non-Hasidic [[Litvish]] yeshivas that are controlled by dynastically transmitted [[rosh yeshiva]]s and the majority of students will not become rabbis, even after many years of post-graduate [[kollel]] study.

Some yeshivas, such as [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Yeshivas Chafetz Chaim]] and [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, may encourage their students to obtain ''semichah'' and mostly serve as rabbis who teach in other yeshivas or Hebrew day schools. Other yeshivas, such as [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin|Yeshiva Chaim Berlin]] ([[Brooklyn]], New York) or the Mirrer Yeshiva (in [[Mir (Brooklyn)|Brooklyn]] and [[Mir (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]]), do not have an official &quot;semichah/rabbinical program&quot; to train rabbis, but provide semichah on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis if and when one of their senior students is offered a rabbinical position but only with the approval of their ''rosh yeshivas''.

Haredim will often prefer using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names for rabbinic titles based on older traditions, such as: ''[[Rav]]'' (denoting &quot;rabbi&quot;), ''HaRav'' (&quot;the rabbi&quot;), ''Moreinu HaRav'' (&quot;our teacher the rabbi&quot;), ''[[Moreinu]]'' (&quot;our teacher&quot;), ''Moreinu VeRabeinu HaRav'' (&quot;our teacher and our rabbi/master the rabbi&quot;), ''Moreinu VeRabeinu'' (&quot;our teacher and our rabbi/master&quot;), ''[[Rosh yeshiva]]'' (&quot;[the] head [of the] yeshiva&quot;), ''[[Rosh HaYeshiva]]'' (&quot;head [of] the yeshiva&quot;), &quot;Mashgiach&quot; (for [[Mashgiach ruchani]]) (&quot;spiritual supervsor/guide&quot;), ''[[Mara d'atra|Mora DeAsra]]'' (&quot;teacher/decisor&quot; [of] the/this place&quot;), ''HaGaon'' (&quot;the genius&quot;), ''[[Rebbe]]'' (&quot;[our/my] rabbi&quot;), ''HaTzadik'' (&quot;the righteous/saintly&quot;), &quot;ADMOR&quot; (&quot;Adoneinu Moreinu VeRabeinu&quot;) (&quot;our master, our teacher and our rabbi/master&quot;) or often just plain ''[[Reb (Yiddish)|Reb]]'' which is a shortened form of ''rebbe'' that can be used by, or applied to, any married Jewish male as the situation applies.

Note: A ''[[rebbetzin]]'' (a [[Yiddish]] usage common among [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]]) or a ''[[rabbanit]]'' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and used among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) is the official &quot;title&quot; used for, or by, the wife of any Orthodox, Haredi, or Hasidic rabbi. ''Rebbetzin'' may also be used as the equivalent of ''Reb'' and is sometimes abbreviated as such as well.

===Non-Orthodox Judaism===
====Conservative Judaism====
[[Conservative Judaism]] confers semikhah after the completion of a program in the codes of Jewish law and responsa in keeping with Jewish tradition. In addition to knowledge and mastery of the study of Talmud and [[halakhah]], Conservative ''semikhah'' also requires that its rabbinical students receive intensive training in [[Tanakh]], classical biblical commentaries, [[biblical criticism]], [[Midrash]], [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidut]], the historical development of Judaism from antiquity to modernity, Jewish ethics, the halakhic methodology of [[Conservative responsa]], classical and modern works of Jewish theology and philosophy, synagogue administration, [[pastoral care]], [[chaplaincy]], non-profit management, and navigating the modern world in a Jewish context. Entrance requirements to Conservative rabbinical study centers include a background within Jewish law and liturgy, familiarity with [[rabbinic literature]], Talmud, etc., ritual observance according to Conservative halakha, and the completion of an undergraduate university degree. In accordance with national collegiate accreditation requirements, Conservative rabbinical students earn a Master of Arts in Rabbinic Literature in addition to receiving ordination.

====Reform Judaism====
In [[Reform Judaism]] rabbinic studies are mandated in pastoral care, the historical development of Judaism, academic biblical criticism, in addition to the study of traditional rabbinic texts. Rabbinical students also are required to gain practical rabbinic experience by working at a congregation as a rabbinic intern during each year of study from year one onwards. All Reform seminaries ordain women and openly [[LGBT]] people as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s.

====Non-orthodox seminaries unaffiliated with main denominations====
There are several possibilities for receiving rabbinic ordination in addition to seminaries maintained by the large Jewish denominations. These include seminaries maintained by smaller denominational movements, and nondenominational (also called &quot;transdenominational&quot; or &quot;postdenominational&quot;) Jewish seminaries.

==Interdenominational recognition==

Historically and until the present, recognition of a rabbi relates to a community's perception of the rabbi's competence to interpret Jewish law and act as a teacher on central matters within Judaism. More broadly speaking, it is also an issue of being a worthy successor to a sacred legacy.

As a result, there have always been greater or lesser disputes about the legitimacy and authority of rabbis. Historical examples include [[Samaritans]] and [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]].

The divisions between Jewish denominations may have their most pronounced manifestation on whether rabbis from one denomination recognize the legitimacy or authority of rabbis in another.

As a general rule within Orthodoxy and among some in the Conservative movement, rabbis are reluctant to accept the authority of other rabbis whose Halakhic standards are not as strict as their own. In some cases, this leads to an outright rejection of even the legitimacy of other rabbis; in others, the more lenient rabbi may be recognized as a spiritual leader of a particular community but may not be accepted as a credible authority on Jewish law.
*The Orthodox rabbinical establishment rejects the validity of Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis on the grounds that their movements' teachings are in violation of traditional Jewish tenets. Some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] rabbis are respectful toward non-Orthodox rabbis and focus on commonalities even as they disagree on interpretation of some areas of Halakha (with Conservative rabbis) or the authority of Halakha (with Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis).
*Conservative rabbis accept the legitimacy of Orthodox rabbis, though they are often critical of Orthodox positions. Although they would rarely look to Reform or Reconstructionist rabbis for Halakhic decisions, they accept the legitimacy of these rabbis' religious leadership.
*Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, on the premise that all the main movements are legitimate expressions of Judaism, will accept the legitimacy of other rabbis' leadership, though will not accept their views on Jewish law, since Reform and Reconstructionists reject [[Halakha]] as binding.

These debates cause great problems for recognition of Jewish marriages, conversions, and other life decisions that are touched by Jewish law. Orthodox rabbis do not recognize conversions by non-Orthodox rabbis. Conservative rabbis recognise all conversions done according to [[Halakha]]. Finally, the North American Reform and Reconstructionists recognize [[patrilineality]], under certain circumstances, as a valid claim towards Judaism, whereas Conservative and Orthodox maintain the position expressed in the [[Talmud]] and Codes that one can be a Jew only through [[matrilineality]] (born of a Jewish mother) or through [[conversion to Judaism]].

==Women rabbis==
{{Main|Women rabbis}}
{{See also|Timeline of women rabbis|Timeline of women rabbis in the United States|Women in Judaism}}

With few rare exceptions, Jewish women have historically been excluded from serving as rabbis. This changed in the 1970s, when due to the shift in American society under the influence of [[second-wave feminism]], the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] began ordaining women as rabbis.&lt;ref name=NYT1972&gt;Blau, Eleanor. [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/04/archives/1st-woman-rabbi-in-us-ordained-she-may-be-only-the-second-in.html &quot;1st Woman Rabbi in U.S. Ordained; She May Be Only the Second in History of Judaism&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 4, 1972. Retrieved September 17, 2009. &quot;Sally HJ. Priesand was ordained at the Isaac M. Wise Temple here today, becoming the first woman rabbi in this country and it is believed, the second in the history of Judaism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Jewish women serve as rabbis within all progressive branches of Judaism, while in [[Orthodox Judaism]], it is a matter of debate, with most communities not accepting women rabbis, while others either ordain women as rabbis or have allowed alternate clerical roles for women (see: [[Yoetzet Halacha]]).&lt;ref name=nadell2019/&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen2012/&gt;

[[File:Kenneth Horne 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|&lt;center&gt;Kenneth Horne&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Charles Kenneth Horne''', generally known as '''Kenneth Horne''', (27 February 1907&amp;nbsp;– 14 February 1969) was an English comedian and businessman. He is perhaps best remembered for his work on three [[BBC Radio]] series: ''[[Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh]]'' (1944–54), ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' (1958–64) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1965–68).

The son of a clergyman who was also a politician, Horne had a burgeoning business career with [[Triplex Safety Glass]], which was interrupted by service with the [[Royal Air Force]] during the Second World War. While serving in a [[barrage balloon]] unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show ''[[Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer]]''. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer [[Richard Murdoch]], and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series ''Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh''. After [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers [[Chad Valley (toy brand)|Chad Valley]].

In 1958 Horne suffered a stroke and gave up his business dealings to focus on his entertainment work. He was the anchor figure in ''Beyond Our Ken'', which also featured [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Hugh Paddick]], [[Betty Marsden]] and [[Bill Pertwee]]. When the programme came to an end in 1964, the same cast recorded four series of the comedy ''Round the Horne''.

Before the planned fifth series of ''Round the Horne'' began recording, Horne died of a heart attack while hosting the annual [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards]]; ''Round the Horne'' could not continue without him and was withdrawn. The series has been regularly re-broadcast since his death. A 2002 BBC radio survey to find listeners' favourite British comedian placed Horne third, behind [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Spike Milligan]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Silvester-Horne-ILN.jpg|thumb|upright|Horne's father, nonconformist minister and Liberal MP [[Silvester Horne]]]]
Kenneth Horne was born Charles Kenneth Horne on 27 February 1907 at [[Ampthill Square]], London.{{sfn|Took|2004}} He was the seventh and youngest child of [[Silvester Horne]] and his wife, Katherine Maria ''{{née}}'' Cozens-Hardy.{{sfn|Hackforth|1976|p=12}}{{sfn|Binfield|2004}} Katherine's father was [[Herbert Cozens-Hardy]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North Norfolk]] who became the [[Master of the Rolls]] in 1907 and [[Baron Cozens-Hardy]] on 1 July 1914.{{sfn|Mathew|Pottle|2004}} Silvester, a powerful orator, was a leading light in the [[Congregationalist]] movement, as minister at the [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road]] from 1903 and, from 1910, chairman of the [[Congregational Union of England and Wales]]. Between 1910 and 1914 he was the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]].{{sfn|Johnston|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Binfield|2004}}

By 1913 Silvester was suffering from continual poor health. He resigned his position at the tabernacle on medical advice in January 1914, and intended to resign his parliamentary seat.{{sfn|Binfield|2004}} On a speaking tour of the US and Canada he lectured at [[Yale University]], and then travelled to Toronto; as the ferry he took entered harbour, he collapsed and died, aged 49; Horne was aged seven at the time.{{sfn|Johnston|2006|pp=8–9}}&lt;ref name=&quot;LP: Silvester death&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;D Tel: jolly old eek&quot; /&gt; From September that year Horne attended [[St George's School, Harpenden]] as a [[Boarding school|boarder]]—the seventh of the Horne children to attend the school.{{sfn|Johnston|2006|p=14}}{{efn|In honour of the Horne family, the school later named one of the rooms Horne Hall, and Horne became a governor of the school.{{sfn|Hackforth|1976|p=1}}}} Although he was not strong academically,{{sfn|Johnston|2006|p=15}} he developed into a good sportsman, representing the school in rugby and cricket,{{sfn|Johnston|2006|pp=18–19}} and during the summer holidays took part in the Public Schoolboys Lawn Tennis Championship at [[Queen's Club]]; in his final appearance in 1925 he was knocked out by the future [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] finalist [[Bunny Austin]].{{sfn|Johnston|2006|p=22}}

In [[economics]], '''industrial organization''' is a field that builds on the [[theory of the firm]] by examining the structure of (and, therefore, the boundaries between) firms and [[market (economics)|market]]s. Industrial organization adds real-world complications to the [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] model, complications such as [[transaction cost]]s,&lt;ref&gt;• [[Ronald H. Coase|R. H.

There are different approaches to the subject. One approach is descriptive in providing an overview of industrial organization, such as measures of competition and the size-[[concentration ratio|concentration]] of firms in an industry. A second approach uses [[microeconomic]] models to explain internal firm organization and market strategy, which includes internal research and development along with issues of internal reorganization and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;• Frederic M.

The extensive use of [[game theory]] in industrial economics has led to the export of this tool to other branches of [[microeconomics]], such as [[behavioral economics]] and [[corporate finance]]. Industrial organization has also had significant practical impacts on [[antitrust law]] and [[competition policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in such advanced textbooks as [[Jean Tirole]], 1988,  ''The Theory of Industrial Organization'', MIT Press, [https://archive.org/details/theoryofindustri00jean description] and chapter-preview [https://archive.org/details/theoryofindustri00jean links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈvɔjt͡ɕɛx ˈvitɔlt jaruˈzɛlskʲi|lang|Pl-Wojciech_Jaruzelski.ogg}}; 6 July 1923 – 25 May 2014) was a [[Poland|Polish]] military officer, politician and ''de facto'' dictator of the [[Polish People's Republic|People's Republic of Poland]] from 1981 until 1989. He was the First Secretary of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] between 1981 and 1989, making him the last leader of the Polish People's Republic. Jaruzelski served as [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] from 1981 to 1985, the [[Polish Council of State|Chairman of the Council of State]] from 1985 to 1989 and briefly as [[President of Poland]] from 1989 to 1990, when the office of President was restored after 37 years. He was also the last commander-in-chief of the [[Polish People's Army]], which in 1990 became the [[Polish Armed Forces]]. 
 
Born to Polish nobility in [[Kurów]] in eastern Poland, Jaruzelski was deported with his family to [[Siberia]] by the [[NKVD]] after the [[invasion of Poland]]. Assigned to forced labour in the Siberian wilderness, he developed [[photokeratitis]] or snow blindness which forced him to wear protective sunglasses for the rest of his life. In 1943, Jaruzelski joined the newly created [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|First Polish Army]] and fought alongside the Soviets against Nazi Germany in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], most notably he took part in the liberation of [[Warsaw]] and in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Following the [[Polish October]] and the expatriation of Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] back to the Soviet Union, Jaruzelski became the chief political officer of the Polish People's Army and eventually [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Polish Minister of Defence]] in 1968.

Jaruzelski became the First Secretary of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and leader of Poland after the brief one-year term of [[Stanisław Kania]]. Kania's predecessor, [[Edward Gierek]], left Poland severely indebted by accepting loans from foreign creditors and the country's economy almost collapsed by the time Jaruzelski became head of state. As Poland headed towards insolvency, [[rationing]] was enforced due to shortages of basic goods, which only contributed to the tense social and political situation. The declining living and working conditions triggered anger among the masses and strengthened anti-communist sentiment; the [[Solidarity movement]] was also gaining support which worried the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Polish Central Committee]] and the Soviet Union that viewed Solidarity as a threat to the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Fearing a Soviet intervention similar to that in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary (1956)]] and [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia (1968)]], Jaruzelski imposed [[martial law in Poland]] on 13 December 1981 to crush the pro-democratic opposition. The [[military junta]], curfew and travel restrictions lasted until 22 July 1983.

By the mid-1980s, censorship lost its importance and the authority of the United Workers' Party disintegrated, thus allowing more freedom in already liberal Poland. During the [[revolutions of 1989]] in Central and Eastern Europe, Jaruzelski supported the change of government for the benefit of the country and resigned after the [[Polish Round Table Agreement]], which led to multi-party elections in Poland. He briefly served as President of Poland but exercised no real power and, in the [[1990 Polish presidential election]], [[Lech Wałęsa]] succeeded him as the first President elected in a popular vote. 

Jaruzelski remains a controversial figure in Poland today; he was fiercely criticized by contemporaries for instigating martial law, during which  thousands of opposition activists were imprisoned without definite charges and as many as 91 were killed. However, some have praised him for doing so in order to prevent a Soviet intervention that would have destabilized the [[Eastern Bloc]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Nevertheless, Jaruzelski remained a patriot and sought political independence for each member country of the Warsaw Pact. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Early life==
Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski was born on 6 July 1923 in [[Kurów]],&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt; into a family of Polish [[Ślepowron coat of arms|gentry]].&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCProfile&gt;{{cite news |last = Repa |first = Jan |title = Profile: Poland's last Communist leader |work=[[BBC News|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News]] |date = 16 May 2001 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1332541.stm |accessdate =26 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Wanda (née Zaremba) and Władysław Mieczysław Jaruzelski, a Czech-educated [[agronomy|agronomist]] and volunteered soldier who fought in the [[Polish–Soviet War|war against Soviet Russia]] in 1920&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1KQdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=zaremba+Jaruzelski |title=Jaruzelski, prime minister of Poland: selected speeches – Wojciech Jaruzelski, Robert Maxwell |publisher= |date=3 November 2006 |isbn=9780080333663 |accessdate=28 May 2014|last1=Jaruzelski |first1=Wojciech |last2=Maxwell |first2=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised on the family estate near [[Wysokie Mazowieckie|Wysokie]] (in the vicinity of [[Białystok]]). From 1933 until September 1939, he was educated in a Catholic school in [[Warsaw]] where he received strict religious education.&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt;

World War II commenced on 1 September 1939 with the [[invasion of Poland]] by Germany, aided by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] sixteen days later. These resulted in the complete defeat of Poland by October and a partition between Soviet and German zones of control. Jaruzelski and his family fled to [[Lithuania]] to stay with some friends. However, a few months later, after Lithuania and the other [[Baltic states]] were [[occupation of the Baltic states|forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union]], Jaruzelski and his family were captured by the [[Red Army]] and designated for deportation to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 1941, they were deprived of all their valuable possessions and deported. At the railway station, Jaruzelski was separated from his father, who was sent directly to a [[labour camp]] (gulag). Jaruzelski and his mother were sent on a month-long journey to [[Biysk]], [[Altai Krai]]. After that, Jaruzelski walked for {{convert|180|km|mi}} to [[Turochak]] where he was responsible for forest cleaning.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu |first1=Yanshun |title=Jaruzelski, the Shaker of Polish History |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Shijiezhishi |location=Beijing, China |isbn=9787501252299 |pages=14–15 |edition=1 |ref=Liu |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimesOne&gt;{{cite news |last = Green |first = Peter S. |title = An Aging Ex-Dictator Who Refuses To Recant |page = 2 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date = 27 May 2001 |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4DF143CF934A15756C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | accessdate =29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his labour work, he was stricken with [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]], suffering permanent damage to his eyes as well as to his back.&lt;ref name=BBCProfile/&gt; His eye condition forced him to wear dark sunglasses most of the time for the rest of his life, which became his trademark.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt; Jaruzelski's father died on 4 June 1942 from [[dysentery]]; his mother and sister survived the war (she died in 1966).

In August 1968, Jaruzelski, as the [[defence minister]], ordered the 2nd Army under General [[Florian Siwicki]] (of the &quot;LWP&quot;) to invade [[Czechoslovakia]], resulting in military occupation of northern Czechoslovakia until 11 November 1968 when under his orders and agreements with the Soviet Union his Polish troops were withdrawn and replaced by the [[Soviet Army]]. In 1970, he was involved in the successful plot against [[Władysław Gomułka]], which led to the appointment of [[Edward Gierek]] as General Secretary of the Polish United Workers Party. There is some question whether he took part in organising the brutal suppression of striking workers; or whether his orders to the Communist military led to [[1970 Polish protests|massacres in the coastal cities]] of [[Gdańsk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbląg]] and [[Szczecin]]. As Minister of Defense, General Jaruzelski was ultimately responsible for 27,000 troops used against unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szporer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Szporer|first=Michael|title=General Wojciech Jaruzelski|url=http://poland.globalmuseumoncommunism.org/poland/bios/jaruzelski|work=Global Museum on Communism|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009113728/http://poland.globalmuseumoncommunism.org/poland/bios/jaruzelski|archivedate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that he was circumvented, which is why he never apologised for his involvement, but he could have resigned, especially after the resignation of foreign minister [[Adam Rapacki]], but did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szporer&quot;/&gt; Jaruzelski became a candidate member for the [[Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party]], the chief executive body of the party, obtaining full membership the following year.&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt;

== Leader of the Polish military government ==
[[File:AGAD Gen. Wojciech jaruzelski 13 grudnia 1981.png|thumbnail|left|Jaruzelski in a television studio, preparing to announce the imposition of martial law, 1981]]
On 11 February 1981, Jaruzelski was named [[Prime Minister of Poland|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] (Prime Minister).  On 18 October, [[Stanisław Kania]] was ousted as [[Polish United Workers' Party#Party leaders|First Secretary of the Central Committee]] of the Polish United Workers' Party after a listening device recorded him criticising the Soviet leadership. Jaruzelski was elected his successor, becoming the only professional soldier to become the leader of a ruling European Communist party.&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

A fortnight after taking power, Jaruzelski met with [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] head [[Lech Wałęsa]] and Catholic bishop [[Józef Glemp]], and hinted that he wanted to bring the church and the union into a sort of coalition government. However, his intention was to crush Solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk-2006&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks Communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As early as September, while he was still merely prime minister, he met with his aides to find an excuse to impose martial law.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk-2006&quot;/&gt; On 13 December, citing purported recordings of Solidarity leaders planning a coup, Jaruzelski organised his own coup by [[martial law in Poland|proclaiming martial law]].&lt;ref name=Revolution1989/&gt;  A [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed, with Jaruzelski as chairman. A BBC News profile of Jaruzelski contends that the establishment of martial law was &quot;an attempt to suppress the Solidarity movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBCProfile/&gt;

According to Jaruzelski, martial law was necessary to avoid a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/howsovietuniondi0000sura|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/howsovietuniondi0000sura/page/69 69]|quote=jaruzelski 1981 december WRON andropov.|title=How the Soviet Union Disappeared: An Essay on the Causes of Dissolution|first=Wisła|last=Suraska|date=1 April 1998|publisher=Duke University Press|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a May 1992 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Jaruzelski said: &quot;Given the strategic logic of the time, I probably would have acted the same way if I had been a Soviet general. At that time, Soviet political and strategic interests were threatened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13680621.html Das war psychische Folter] [[Der Spiegel]], 11 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, at a press conference in September 1997 [[Viktor Kulikov]], former supreme commander of Warsaw Pact forces, denied that the Soviet Union had either threatened or intended to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Byrne, &quot;New Evidence on the Polish Crisis 1980–1981&quot;, Cold War International History Project Bulletin 11 (Winter 1998), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Politburo]] minutes from 10 December 1981, [[Yuri Andropov]] stated &quot;We do not intend to introduce troops into Poland. That is the proper position, and we must adhere to it until the end. I don't know how things will turn out in Poland, but even if Poland falls under the control of Solidarity, that's the way it will be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] CC Politburo, 10 December 1981, Document No. 21, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:00595309(Andropov&amp;Jaruzelski).jpeg|thumb|right|Jaruzelski meeting with [[Yuri Andropov]] in Moscow, 1982]]

Jaruzelski also claimed in 1997 that Washington had given him a &quot;green light&quot;, stating that he had sent Eugeniusz Molczyk to confer with Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]], who had agreed with Molczyk that martial law was the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Perlez, &quot;Warsaw Journal: Old Cold War Enemies Exhume One Battlefield&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 11 November 1997, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether this meeting with the American vice-president occurred is disputed. While it is erroneously cited,{{clarify|date=January 2019}} Harvard historian Mark Kramer has pointed out that no documents support Jaruzelski's claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=CIA’s Historical Review |date=24 October 1997 |title=Cold War era analysis |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/historical-collection-publications/the-warsaw-pact/warsaw-pact.pdf |journal=Soviet – East European Military Relations in Historical Perspective Sources and Reassessments |publisher=The Historical Collections Division (HCD) of the Office of Information Management Services |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=18 of 44 |format=PDF file, direct download 12.2 MB |accessdate=26 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124212240/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/historical-collection-publications/the-warsaw-pact/warsaw-pact.pdf |archivedate=24 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaruzelski was chiefly responsible for the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] on 13 December 1981 in an attempt to crush the [[History of Solidarity|pro-democracy movements]], which included Solidarity, the first non-Communist trade union in [[Warsaw Pact]] history. Subsequent years saw his government and its internal security forces censor, persecute, and jail thousands of journalists and opposition activists without charge; few lost their lives in the first days of the introduction of martial law. The socio-economic crisis deepened even more than in the late 1970s and rationing of basic foods such as sugar, milk, and meat, as well as materials such as gasoline and consumer products, continued while the median income of the population fell by as much as 10 percent. During Jaruzelski's rule from 1981 to 1989, around 300,000 people left the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-analysis&quot;/&gt;

Historical evidence released under [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] indicates that the Soviet Union did not plan to invade Poland. In fact, Jaruzelski actually tried to persuade the Soviets to invade in order to support martial law, only to be sternly turned down. This left the Solidarity &quot;problem&quot; to be sorted out by the Polish government (see also [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981]]). However, the exact plans of the Soviet Union at that time have never been determined. Jaruzelski, however, justified cracking down by alleging that the threat of Soviet intervention was quite likely had he not dealt with Solidarity internally. This question, as well as many other facts about [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland in the years 1945–1989]], are presently under the investigation of government historians at the [[Institute of National Remembrance|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]] (IPN), whose publications reveal facts from the Communist-era archives. Additionally, there are numerous confirmations from Czech army officers of the time speaking of ''Operation [[Krkonoše]]'', plan of armed invasion of Poland, because of which many units of the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] were stationed on highest alert, ready for deployment within hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aktualne.centrum.cz/blogy/petr-klan.php?itemid=4576|title=Petr Klan » Když disident ujede|author=|date=|website=Aktuálně.cz - Víte, co se právě děje|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Jaruzelski helped reorganise the [[Front of National Unity]], the organisation the Communists used to manage their satellite parties, as the [[Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-analysis&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, Jaruzelski resigned as prime minister and defence minister and became the Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State]], a post equivalent to that of the head of state of Poland. However, his power centered on and firmly entrenched in his coterie of &quot;LWP&quot; generals and lower ranks officers of the Polish Communist Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-analysis&quot;/&gt;

The policies of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] stimulated political reform in Poland as well as in other communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanford|first=George|date=1984|title=The Polish Communist Leadership and the Onset of the State of War|journal=Soviet Studies|volume=36|issue=4|pages=494–512|doi=10.1080/09668138408411551|jstor=151930|issn=0038-5859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 February to 15 April 1989, negotiations were held between 13 [[working group]]s during 94 sessions of the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|roundtable talks]]. These negotiations &quot;radically altered the shape &quot;of the Polish government and society&quot;, and resulted in an agreement which stated that a great degree of political power would be given to a newly created [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]]. It also restored a post of [[President of Poland|president]] to act as head of state and chief executive. Solidarity was also declared a legal organisation. During the ensuing [[1989 Polish legislative election|partially-free elections]], the Communists and their allies were allocated 65 percent of the seats in the [[Sejm]]. Solidarity won all the remaining elected seats, and 99 out of the 100 seats in the fully elected Senate were also won by Solidarity-backed candidates.&lt;ref name=CNNProfile&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Gen.

He was the only candidate.

Jaruzelski was unsuccessful in convincing [[Lech Wałęsa]] to include Solidarity in a &quot;grand coalition&quot;&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt; with the Communists. He resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July 1989.&lt;ref name=CNNProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name=paula&gt;{{cite news|last=Butturini|first=Paula|title=Solidarity Foe Is New Polish Party Chief|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-30/news/8902210508_1_solidarity-secretaries-party-leadership-positions|accessdate=14 July 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=30 July 1989|location=Warsaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mieczysław Rakowski]] succeeded him as party leader.&lt;ref name=paula/&gt;

The Communists initially intended to give Solidarity a few token cabinet posts for the sake of appearances.  However,  Wałęsa persuaded the Communists' two allied parties, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Alliance of Democrats (Poland)|Alliance of Democrats]] (SD), to break their alliance with the PZPR.&lt;ref name=&quot;BiskupskiPula2010&quot;&gt;Piotr Wróbel, ''Rebuilding Democracy in Poland, 1989-2004'', in {{cite book|author1=M.

In October 1994, while attending a book-selling activity in [[Wroclaw]], Jaruzelski was attacked by a male pensioner with a stone and had his jaw injured, after which he was sent to a hospital to receive surgery. The man had been arrested in prison during the martial law period. Later, the man was sentenced two years and fined 200 [[zloty]].&lt;ref name=Liu2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu |first1=Yanshun |title=Jaruzelski, the Shaker of Polish History |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Shijiezhishi |location=Beijing, China |isbn=9787501252299 |pages=354 |edition=1 |ref=Liu |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2001, Jaruzelski said that he believed Communism failed and that he was now a [[social democracy|social democrat]].  He also announced his support for then-President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], as well as future Prime Minister [[Leszek Miller]].

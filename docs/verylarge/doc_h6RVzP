Edward's opponents began to gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became increasingly anxious about the possibility that Mortimer might invade England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=491–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella and Mortimer turned to [[William I, Count of Hainaut]], and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William's daughter, [[Philippa of Hainault|Philippa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=493–494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for the advantageous alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 [[transport vessel]]s and 8 [[warship]]s to assist in the invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=493–494; 500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion===

During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences along the coasts of England to protect against the possibility of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleets were gathered at the ports of [[Portsmouth]] in the south and [[River Orwell|Orwell]] on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into [[Normandy]] as a diversionary attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruddick|2013|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent or promptly turned against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=160–164, 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=501, 504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Mortimer, Isabella, and thirteen-year-old Prince Edward, accompanied by King Edward's half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, landed in Orwell on 24 September with a small force of men and met with no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, enemies of the Despensers moved rapidly to join them, including Edward's other half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton; [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], who had inherited the earldom from his brother Thomas; and a range of senior clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=503–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensconced in the residence halls of the fortified and secure [[Tower of London]], Edward attempted to garner support from within the capital. The city of London rose against his government, and on 2 October he left London, taking the Despensers with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=505}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; London descended into anarchy, as mobs attacked Edward's remaining officials and associates, killing his former treasurer Walter Stapledon in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], and taking the Tower and releasing the prisoners inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=506–507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward continued west up the [[Thames Valley]], reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; he hoped to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day by day they gathered new supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from [[Chepstow]], probably aiming first for [[Lundy]] and then for Ireland, where the king hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=510–511}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at [[Cardiff]]. Edward retreated to [[Caerphilly Castle]] and attempted to rally his remaining forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's authority collapsed in England where, in his absence, Isabella's faction took over the administration with the support of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=512–513}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=514–515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was escorted first to [[Monmouth Castle]], and from there back into England, where he was held at the Earl of Lancaster's fortress at [[Kenilworth Castle|Kenilworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=515, 518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdication===
{{Main|Parliament of 1327}}
[[File:Eduard2 arest.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of Isabella capturing Edward|A 15th-century depiction of Isabella capturing Edward]]
Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took revenge on the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, declared a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=516–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in [[Fleet Prison]]; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, but most of the new administration had a lot to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=520–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no established procedure for removing an English king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=523–524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Orleton, the [[Bishop of Hereford]], made a series of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=524–525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=529–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this, a representative delegation of barons, clergy and knights was sent to Kenilworth to speak to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1327, the Earl of Lancaster and the [[John de Stratford|bishops of Winchester]] and [[Henry Burghersh|Lincoln]] met privately with Edward in the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=534}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; They informed Edward that if he were to resign as monarch, his son Prince Edward would succeed him, but if he failed to do so, his son might be disinherited as well, and the crown given to an alternative candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tears, Edward agreed to abdicate, and on 21 January, Sir [[William Trussell]], representing the kingdom as a whole, withdrew his homage and formally ended Edward's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=535}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proclamation was sent to London, announcing that Edward, now known as Edward of Caernarvon, had freely resigned his kingdom and that Prince Edward would succeed him. The coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1327.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=536, 539, 541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death (1327)==

Those opposed to the new government began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move him to the more secure location of [[Berkeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]], where Edward arrived around 5 April 1327.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=542–543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once at the castle, he was kept in the custody of Mortimer's son-in-law, [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley]], and [[John Maltravers]], who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P541&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated.&lt;ref name=Phillips2011P541/&gt; A poem, the &quot;[[Lament of Edward II]]&quot;, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.&lt;ref name=Poemdetails&gt;{{harvnb|Galbraith|1935|p=221}}; {{harvnb|McKisack|1959|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Smallwood|1973|p=528}}; {{harvnb|Valente|2002|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|For a sceptical comment, see [[Vivian Galbraith]]; [[May McKisack]] reserved judgement, noting that &quot;if he was indeed the author of the Anglo-Norman lament ascribed to him, he knew something of versification&quot;; M.

Concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into the prison within the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=543–544}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=546–547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September Edward III was informed that his father had died at Berkeley Castle during the night of 21 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians agree that Edward II did die at Berkeley on that date, although there is a minority view that he died much later.&lt;ref name=MainstreamList/&gt;{{refn|Mainstream historical interpretations of Edward's death include those of Seymour Phillips, who argues that it is &quot;likely that he was murdered, probably by suffocation&quot;; Roy Haines who suggests that he was probably murdered and that &quot;there is little reason to doubt that Edward of Caernarfon's corpse has remained there [Gloucester Cathedral] undisturbed since December 1327 or thereabouts&quot;; Mira Rubin, who concludes that Edward may have been murdered; Michael Prestwich, who has &quot;no doubt&quot; that Mortimer plotted to murder Edward, and that he &quot;almost certainly died at Berkeley&quot;; Joe Burden, who believes that Mortimer issued orders for Edward to be killed, and that Edward was buried at Gloucester; Mark Ormrod, who argues that Edward was probably murdered, and Edward is buried at Gloucester; Jeffrey Hamilton, who finds the argument that Edward survived Berkeley &quot;fantastic&quot;; and Chris Given-Wilson, who believes it is &quot;almost certainly&amp;nbsp;... true&quot; that Edward died on the night of 21 September and was murdered.&lt;ref name=MainstreamList&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=54–55}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Burden|2004|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Ormrod|2004|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=563}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=198, 226, 232}}; {{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|p=133}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750063.ece | title=Holy Fool |mode=cs2 | accessdate=22 April 2014 | last1= Given-Wilson | first1= Chris | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | date = 9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} His death was, as Mark Ormrod notes, &quot;suspiciously timely&quot;, as it simplified Mortimer's political problems considerably, and most historians believe that Edward probably was murdered on the orders of the new regime, although it is impossible to be certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ormrod|2004|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the individuals suspected of involvement in the death, including Sir Thomas Gurney, Maltravers and {{ill|William Ockley|fr}}, later fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=572–576}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Thomas Berkeley was spared by Edward III, after a jury concluded in 1331 that he had not been involved in the killing of the late king.

John Maltravers was not formally accused of murdering Edward II but left for Europe and from there contacted Edward III, possibly to make a deal over what he knew about the events of 1327; after a period in exile he was ultimately pardoned and given permission to return to England in 1345.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=575–576}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} If Edward died from natural causes, his death may have been hastened by [[major depressive disorder|depression]] following his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long after the announcement of Edward's death.

===Burial and cult===
[[File:Edward ll tomb - geograph.org.uk - 1704667.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Edward's tomb|Edward II's tomb at [[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]
Edward's body was [[embalmed]] at Berkeley Castle, where it was viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burden|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then taken to [[Gloucester Abbey]] on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the [[high altar]], the funeral having probably been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Burden|2004|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The historian Joel Burden notes that this delay in burial was not unusual for the period; the bodies of many other royalty, including Edward I and Isabella of France, remained unburied for a similar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the king's body, and because it was close to Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Burden|2004|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although it was normal for Westminster Abbey to be used to bury English monarchs by the 14th century, the practice was not as formalised as it later became.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burden|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with [[gold leaf]] and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burden|2004|pp=16–17, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward III's government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young king's own reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burden|2004|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temporary wooden [[effigy]] with a copper crown was made for the funeral; this is the first known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, as he had been dead for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|pp=106, 119}}; {{harvnb|Burden|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Newgate Church]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb includes a very early example of an English [[alabaster]] effigy, with a [[tomb chest]] and a canopy made of [[oolite]] and [[Purbeck stone]].&lt;ref name=Duffy2003PP119GloucesterWebsite&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|pp=119, 122}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk/index.php?page=edward-ii-tomb | title=Edward II Tomb|mode=cs2 | accessdate=22 April 2014 | publisher=Gloucester Cathedral | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was buried in the shirt, [[coif]] and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a [[sceptre]] and [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]], and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|pp=106, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Earlier scholarship had argued that the effigy on the tomb was an idealised carving, although more recent work has put more emphasis on its likely resemblance to Edward II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=121}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

{{Anchor|Controversial death}}

===Controversies===

Controversy rapidly surrounded Edward's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Mortimer's execution in 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward had been murdered at Berkeley Castle. Accounts that he had been killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or [[Fire iron|poker]] into his [[anus]] slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=562}}; {{harvnb|Ormrod|2006|pp=37–38}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2004|pp=191–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ormrod|2006|pp=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in his captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mortimer|2004|pp=193–194}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=563}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Initial sources either did not suggest that Edward had been murdered at all, or suggested that he had been suffocated or strangled. The first sources to begin to successfully popularise the &quot;anal rape&quot; narrative were the longer ''Brut'' and ''Polychronicon'' chronicles in the mid-1330s and 1340s respectively. One of Edward's biographers, Seymour Phillips, notes that while the hot iron story could be true, it is much more likely that he was suffocated, noting that the account of the red hot iron seems suspiciously similar to earlier accounts of the murder of King [[Edmund Ironside]]; the similarities to this earlier story are also highlighted by Ian Mortimer and Pierre Chaplais. His other biographer, Roy Haines, makes no reference at all to the red hot poker story. Ian Mortimer, who argues that Edward did not die in 1327, naturally disputes the &quot;anal rape&quot; story. Paul Doherty notes that modern historians take the &quot;lurid description of Edward's death with more than a pinch of salt&quot;. Michael Prestwich has noted that most of Geoffrey le Baker's story &quot;belongs to the world of romance rather than of history&quot;, but has also noted that Edward &quot;very possibly&quot; died from the insertion of a red hot iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=562–564}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2006|pp=51, 55}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2004|p=131}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

Another set of theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the &quot;[[Fieschi Letter]]&quot;, sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward's corpse to avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is often linked to an account of Edward III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in [[Antwerp]] in 1338, who claimed to be Edward II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the letter's content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=189–208}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=222–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few historians have supported versions of its narrative.

Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he &quot;was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues&quot;, echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as &quot;incompetent and vicious&quot;, and as &quot;no man of business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=142, 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he &quot;was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one&quot;, preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|pp=31–33, 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could take a keen interest in the minutiae of administration, however, and on occasion engaged in the details of a wide range of issues across England and his wider domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Most historians suggest that Edward increased his engagement with administration in the 1320s, although Michael Prestwich suggests that many of Edward's later correspondence on governmental issues were written for him by the Despensers. Generally, current historians have tended to stress Edward's later role in governance, even if he did not necessarily prove to be a competent or successful administrator. Miri Rubin argues that he was &quot;deeply involved&quot; in governance and portrays Edward's abilities sympathetically; Anthony Musson stresses Edward's later involvement in the legal system; Seymour Phillips argues that Edward was more closely involved in governmental business than has been previously suggested, although his interest was &quot;sporadic and unpredictable&quot;, and heavily influenced by his advisors; Roy Haines notes Edward's &quot;idiosyncrasy&quot; in engaging in business, and the dominant role of the Despensers in setting policy, but stops short of Prestwich's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=219}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=140–141}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=608}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

One of Edward's persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward worked his way through many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise.&lt;ref name=Prestwich2003PP94Phillips2011PP218/&gt; He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno.&lt;ref name=Prestwich2003PP94Phillips2011PP218&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=94–95}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and directly cutting back on the expenses of his own household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward made extensive use of [[Roman civil law]] during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of [[English common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|2006|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local [[gentry]]; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=148, 300–301}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Edward's rule, parliament's importance grew as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were &quot;still as much an event as an institution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Valente|1998|p=868}}; {{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=165–166}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1311, parliament began to include, in addition to the barons, the representatives of the [[knight]]s and [[burgess (title)|burgesses]], who in later years would constitute the &quot;[[House of Commons of England|commons]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=169, 172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use the parliamentary meetings as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=170–171, 175–177}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; After resisting it for many years, Edward began intervening in parliament in the second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=180–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear whether he was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|2006|pp=167–168, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court===
[[File:Cambridge 1575 colour Trinity College.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Detail of 1575 map|1575 map showing the [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] (top left) founded by Edward]]
Edward's royal court was itinerant, travelling around the country with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; When housed in Westminster Palace, the court occupied a complex of two halls, seven chambers and three [[chapel]]s, along with other smaller rooms, but, due to the Scottish conflict, the court spent much of its time in Yorkshire and Northumbria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of the court was Edward's royal household, in turn divided into the &quot;hall&quot; and the &quot;chamber&quot;; the size of the household varied over time, but in 1317 was around 500 strong, including household knights, squires, kitchen and transport staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The household was surrounded by a wider group of courtiers, and appears to have also attracted a circle of prostitutes and criminal elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=63, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and minstrels were very popular at Edward's court, but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=69, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enamelling at court, which would have been richly decorated.&lt;ref name=Prestwich2006P69/&gt;{{refn|Among his more esoteric valuables, Edward had a pitcher, allegedly made from a [[griffin]]'s egg.&lt;ref name=Prestwich2006P69&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Edward kept a [[camel]] as a pet and, as a young man, took a [[lion]] with him on campaign to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court could be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian [[snake-charmer]] in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=61, 69}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The historian Miri Rubin argues that the displays show a lack of royal decorum. The historian Michael Prestwich notes that these court events imply to many &quot;a decadent extravagance, fitting the familiar stereotype of the king&quot;, but goes on to argue that the court was really &quot;conventional, and perhaps even rather dull&quot;; Seymour Phillips questions if the naked French dancers were genuinely extravagant or simply intended to fit in with local French royal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|pp=61, 74}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Rubin|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

===Religion===
Edward's approach to religion was normal for the period, and the historian Michael Prestwich describes him as &quot;a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes&quot;.&lt;ref name=Prestiwch2006P67&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were daily chapel services and [[alms-giving]] at his court, and Edward blessed the sick, although he did this less often than his predecessors.&lt;ref name=Prestiwch2006P67/&gt; Edward remained close to the Dominican Order, who had helped to educate him, and followed their advice in asking for papal permission to be anointed with the Holy Oil of St Thomas of Canterbury in 1319; this request was refused, causing the king some embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward supported the expansion of the universities during his reign, establishing [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] in Cambridge to promote training in religious and civil law, [[Oriel College]] in Oxford and a [[Trinity College, Dublin#History|short-lived university in Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Musson|2006|p=157}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward enjoyed a good relationship with Pope Clement V, despite the king's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Menache|2002|p=60}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Menache|2002|pp=66, 70–71, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXII]], elected in 1316, sought Edward's support for a new crusade, and was also inclined to support him politically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 263&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed to by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and never offered his homage, another part of the 1213 agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2011 263&quot;/&gt; In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
[[File:Oriel College Charter.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of medieval charter|[[Oriel College]]'s 1326 charter from Edward]]
No chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased, often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause, but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaplais|1994|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=36–39}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Polychronicon]]'', ''[[Vita Edwardi Secundi]]'', ''Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi'' and the ''Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon'' for example all condemned the king's personality, habits and choice of companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other records from his reign show criticism by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political song]]s were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and [[Thomas Ringstead]], rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of [[Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, Duke of Épernon]], and [[Henry III of France]], and between [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], and [[Charles I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 19th century, popular historians such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] popularised Edward's life with the [[Victorian era|Victorian public]], focusing on the king's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=32, 40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Views on his sexuality have continued to develop over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prestwich 2003 72&quot;/&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as [[William Stubbs]], [[Thomas Tout]] and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign.&lt;ref name=WaughPhillipsP241&gt;{{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although critical of what they regarded as Edward II's inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward, which they perceived as positive developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s the historiography of Edward's reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=WaughPhillipsP241/&gt; The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, [[John Maddicott]] and [[Seymour Phillips]] re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone's work on Edward's early years and [[Natalie Fryde]]'s study of Edward's final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the king were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|2006|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1985|p=103}}; {{harvnb|Waugh|1991|p=241}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2005|p=1295}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750300.ece | title=Holy Fool |mode=cs2 | accessdate=26 June 2014 | last1= Given-Wilson | first1= Chris | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | date = 9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several plays have shaped Edward's contemporary image.&lt;ref name=Burgtorf2008P31&gt;{{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' was first performed around 1592 and focuses on Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawrence|2006|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Martin|2010|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2010|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries [[James VI of Scotland]] and Henry III of France, may have influenced [[William Shakespeare]]'s portrayal of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Logan|2007|pp=83–84}}; {{harvnb|Perry|2000|pp=1055–1056, 1062–1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the playwright [[Ben Jonson]] picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, ''[[Mortimer His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lawrence|2006|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker [[Derek Jarman]] adapted the Marlowe play into a [[Edward II (film)|film]] in 1991, creating a [[postmodern]] [[pastiche]] of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Prasch|1993|p=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jarman's version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the tradition in the Fieschi letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prasch|1993|pp=1165–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in [[Mel Gibson]]'s 1995 film ''[[Braveheart]]'', where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brintnell|2011|pp=40–41}}; {{harvnb|Burgtorf|2008|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aberth|2003|pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. In the Victorian era, the painting ''Edward II and Piers Gaveston'' by [[Marcus Stone]] strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horne|1999|pp=31, 40, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the director [[David Bintley]] used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet ''[[Edward II (ballet)|Edward II]]'', first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]]'s symphony ''Edward II'', produced in 2000.&lt;ref name=Burgtorf2008P31/&gt; Novels such as John Penford's 1984 ''The Gascon'' and Chris Hunt's 1992 ''Gaveston'' have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while [[Stephanie Merritt]]'s 2002 ''Gaveston'' transports the story into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Burgtorf2008P31/&gt;

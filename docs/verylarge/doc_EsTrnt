There has been a resurgence of interest in [[synthetic phonics]] in recent years, particularly in [[England]]. As of 2013, all (local-authority-maintained) primary schools in England have a statutory requirement to teach synthetic phonics in years one and two. In addition, any pupil who is struggling to decode words properly by year three must &quot;urgently&quot; receive help through a &quot;rigorous and systematic phonics programme&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-primary-curriculum|title=National curriculum in England primary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, synthetic phonics was promoted by a cross-party group of Parliamentarians, particularly [[Nick Gibb]] MP. A report by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Education and Skills Committee]] called for a review of the phonics content in the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. Subsequently, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] announced a review into early years reading, headed by Sir Jim Rose, former Director of Inspection for [[Ofsted]] (responsible for the education standards in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted|title=Ofsted}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review, entitled [[Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006)]], addresses the question of why children's reading and writing (especially for boys) have not been meeting expectations. Paragraph 3.25 of the Final Report states &quot;This suggests that it is far more often the nature of the teaching than the nature of the child which determines success or failure in learning the 'basic' skills of reading and writing.” It goes on to say it is not suggesting teachers are unable or unwilling to develop the required expertise, only that there has been systematic confusion and conflicting views about phonics. It also makes it clear that, when it comes to the wider knowledge and skills required for reading and writing, phonics work is &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512233640/http://publications.teachernet.gov.uk/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006PDF-EN-01.pdf|title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading, 2006, p 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes by suggesting the challenge will be resolved as research continues to support systematic phonics, and that teacher training and systematic phonics programs will produce &quot;good results for children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WyseGoswami2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic |last2=Goswami |first2=Usha|title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading|journal=British Educational Research Journal|volume=34 |issue=6|year=2008|pages=691–710 |issn=0141-1926 |doi=10.1080/01411920802268912}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary Curriculum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/Primary_curriculum_Report.pdf |title=Independent Review of the Primary Curriculum: Final Report |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2010, a government white paper contained plans to train all primary school teachers in phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8147987/Education-White-Paper-key-points-explained.html|title=Education White Paper key points explained|publisher=The Daily Telegraph [Telegraph.co.uk]|accessdate=20 November 2010|location=London|first=Nick|last=Collins|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/425601/PRIMARY_national_curriculum.pdf|title=UK Primary National Curriculum, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has &quot;statutory requirements&quot; that, amongst other things, students in years one and two be capable in using systematic synthetic phonics in regards to Word Reading, Reading Comprehension, Fluency, and Writing. This includes having skills in &quot;sound to graphemes&quot;, &quot;decoding&quot;, and &quot;blending&quot;. Following this, [[Ofsted]] updated their guidance for school inspectors in 2014 to include tips on how schools should teach reading with systematic phonics, including &quot;Getting them Reading Early&quot;. It includes a description of the [[simple view of reading]] as ''the word recognition processes'' (recognizing the words on the page, free of context and using phonics) and the ''language recognition processes'' (understanding the meaning of the language). It also includes some videos to illustrate its principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/379489/Getting_20them_20reading_20early.doc|title=Getting them Reading Early, OFSTED, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wGfNiweEkI|title=Synthetic Phonics, Mr. T's phonics, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Carter Review of Initial Teacher Training (published by the [[Department for Education]] calls for [[Evidence-based education|evidence-based teaching]] to be part of the framework for initial teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carter-review-of-initial-teacher-training|title=Carter review of initial teacher training, DFE, 21015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives an example of a case study in which &quot;trainees on the Early Reading placement are required to work alongside a literacy specialist to plan and teach a phonics lesson to a group, evaluate the lesson and deliver a second lesson in light of their evaluation&quot;.

The 2016 [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS) awarded England its best results since the studies began in 2001. Nick Gibb attributes this success to the use of [[synthetic phonics|systematic synthetic phonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The report states that in 2010 33% percent of primary school students did not achieve the expected standard in reading, however &quot;since the introduction of the phonics reading check in 2012&quot;, that number is down to 20%. The report goes on to say they still have much to do, particularly with students who are disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508447/Educational_Excellence_Everywhere.pdf|title=Educational Excellence Everywhere, pages 5-6, Department for Education, England, March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-12-07-england’s-students-rise-international-literacy-ranks|title=England’s students rise up the international literacy ranks, University of Oxford, 2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664562/PIRLS_2016_National_Report_for_England-_BRANDED.pdf|title=Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS): National Report for England, December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2016 the London School of Economics published a paper supporting the teaching of synthetic phonics to disadvantaged children because it helps to close the literacy gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/phonics-method-helps-close-attainment-gap-study-finds|title=Phonics helps to close the attainment gap:The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1425.pdf|title=Teaching to teach literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[Ofsted]], as part of its curriculum research, has produced a YouTube video on Early Reading. It states &quot;It is absolutely essential that every child master the phonic code as quickly as possible ... So, successful schools firstly teach phonics first, fast and furious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQipfbc7fg&amp;list=PLLq-zBnUkspPXjODb3PJ4gCqNc2LvfhSh&amp;index=4 |title=YouTube video, Early Reading, Bradley Simmons, Regional Director, South West at Ofsted, UK, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2019 Ofsted published a report entitled ''Education inspection framework: overview of research'' that further supports ''systematic synthetic phonics'' together with phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/813228/Research_for_EIF_framework_100619__16_.pdf|title=Education inspection framework: overview of research, page 19, Ofsted, January 2019, No. 180045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has been concern expressed about the phonics screening test at the end of year one, some report that phonics is especially valuable for poor readers and those without English as a first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/how-phonics-took-over-english-schools|title=How phonics took over English schools, The Economist, 2019-07-18.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

Before the beginning of compulsory education a Finnish child must participate in one year of preprimary education, and compulsory education usually starts at age 7. Some suggest that most Finnish children are reading before they start school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shanahanonliteracy.com/blog/when-should-reading-instruction-begin|title=When should reading instruction begin, Shanahan on literacy, 2019-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In grades one and two, students in [[Finland]] develop their reading skills by practicing techniques in the areas of sound–letter correspondence (phonics); breaking down speech into words, syllables, and sounds; word recognition; spelling; daily reading and writing; and comprehension strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/finland/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/ |title= PIRLS 2016, Language/Reading Curriculum in the Fourth Grade, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Finland ranked 5th in Reading Achievement for fourth-graders according to the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/ |title=Distribution of Reading Achievement, exhibit 1.1, PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===

There has been a strong debate in [[France]] on the teaching of phonics (&quot;méthode syllabique&quot;) versus whole language (&quot;méthode globale&quot;). After the 1990s, supporters of the later started defending a so-called &quot;mixed method&quot; (also known as [[Balanced literacy]]) in which approaches from both methods are used. France is home to some of the most influential researchers in psycho-pedagogy, cognitive sciences and neurosciences, such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25GI3-kiLdo&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Youtube, How the Brain Learns to Read – Prof. Stanislas Dehaene, October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:fr:Michel Fayol|Michel Fayol]]. These researchers have studied the problem from the perspective of their sciences and put their heavy scientific weight on the side of phonics.

More recently, with the appointment of the academic [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]] as minister of education, the ministry created a science educational council&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-24|title=Conseil scientifique de l'Éducation nationale|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conseil_scientifique_de_l%27%C3%89ducation_nationale&amp;oldid=146747364|journal=Wikipédia|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; chaired by Dehaene. This council openly supported phonics. In April 2018, the minister issued a set of four guiding documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid129644/4-priorites-pour-renforcer-la-maitrise-des-fondamentaux.html|title=4 priorités pour renforcer la maîtrise des fondamentaux|last=nationale|first=Ministère de l'Éducation|work=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale|access-date=2018-05-06|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; for early teaching of reading and mathematics and a booklet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid129644/4-priorites-pour-renforcer-la-maitrise-des-fondamentaux.html#Pour_enseigner_la_lecture_et_l_ecriture_au_CP_telechargez_le_guide|title=4 priorités pour renforcer la maîtrise des fondamentaux|last=nationale|first=Ministère de l'Éducation|work=Ministère de l'Éducation nationale|access-date=2018-05-06|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing phonics recommendations. Teachers unions and a few educationalists were very critical of his stances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2013/12/31/apprentissage-de-la-lecture-depassons-l-opposition-archaique-entre-methode-syllabique-et-methode-globale_4341366_3232.html|title=Apprentissage de la lecture : opposer méthode syllabique et méthode globale est archaïque|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classified his perspective as &quot;traditionalist&quot;, trying to bring the debate to the political sphere. But Blanquer has openly declared that the so-called mixed approach is no serious choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2018/04/26/l-education-nationale-publie-quatre-circulaires-de-recommandations-pour-les-enseignants_5290908_1473685.html#bpvwbEylxc6AB5e7.99 « Entre quelque chose qui ne marche pas – la méthode globale – et quelque chose qui fonctionne – la syllabique – il ne peut y avoir de “compromis” mixte. Ce sujet ne relève pas de l’opinion, mais de faits démontrés par la recherche. C’est très clair. »]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, France is slightly above average in Reading Achievement for fourth-graders according to the ''Progress in International Reading Literacy Study'' (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=Distribution of Reading Achievement, exhibit 1.1, PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===

The official language and the language of instruction in the Republic of [[Hungary]] is the [[Hungarian language]]. However, in 2010 4.6% of minority students (Croatians, Germans, Romanians, Serbians, Slovaks, and Slovenes) attended minority operated mother tongue, bilingual, or language teaching schools or kindergartens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/hungary|title=PIRLS 2016 ENCYCLOPEDIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crèche (nursery school) in Hungary is a &quot;welfare institution&quot; catering for children aged 20 weeks to 3 years and providing professional day care and development. In addition, kindergarten education and care is free and compulsory for children aged 3-6. Socially disadvantaged children are given priority in enrolment. Pre-school programmes focus on developing children’s emergent literacy skills through play rather than systematic training in phonics or teaching the alphabet.

According to the [[PIRLS]] Encyclopedia, the Ministry of Education does not explicitly recommend one particular reading method over another, however all the accredited textbook series use the &quot;sounding-analyzing method&quot;. The ''European Literacy Policy Network'' (ELINET) 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eli-net.eu|title=European literacy policy network (ELINET)}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that Hungarian children in grades one and two receive explicit instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics &quot;as the route to decode words&quot;. In grades three and four they continue to apply their knowledge of phonics, however the emphasis shifts to the more meaning-focused technical aspects of reading and writing (i.e., vocabulary, types of texts, reading strategies, spelling, punctuation and grammar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eli-net.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Hungary_Long_Report.pdf|title=Literacy in Hungary, European literacy policy network 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Hungary achieved the 13th highest score in reading literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS reading achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19% of their students performed at or below the low benchmark on overall reading, just above the EU average of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eli-net.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Hungary_Long_Report.pdf|title=Literacy in Hungary, European literacy policy network 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===

The school curriculum in [[Ireland]] focuses on ensuring children are literate in both the [[English language]] and the [[Irish language]]. In 2011, the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)]] developed a national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.education.ie/en/publications/education-reports/pub_ed_interim_review_literacy_numeracy_2011_2020.pdf |title= Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011–2020): Interim Review 2011–2016; New Targets 2017–2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2014 teachers’ Professional Development guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pdst.ie/sites/default/files/15.%20The%20Reading%20Process%20(1).pdf |title=PDST, The Reading Process, A Guide to the Teaching and Learning of Reading, Dublin, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers the seven areas of attitude and motivation, fluency, comprehension, word identification, vocabulary, phonological awareness, phonics, and assessment. It recommends that phonics be taught in a systematic and structured way and is preceded by training in phonological awareness.

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Ireland achieved the 4th highest score in Reading Literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref name=&quot;1c&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/wp-content/uploads/structure/PIRLS/3.-achievement-in-purposes-and-comprehension-processes/3_1_achievement-in-reading-purposes.pdf|title= Exhibit 3.1: Achievement in Reading Purposes, PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) for 2018 showed Ireland's 15-year-old students were significantly above average in reading, science and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.oecd.org/pisa/|title= PISA is the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 Primary Language Curriculum specifies that reading outcomes must include phonics, [[phonological awareness]], and [[phonemic awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/2a6e5f79-6f29-4d68-b850-379510805656/PLC-Document_English.pdf|title= The Primary Language Curriculum, Department of Education and Skills, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America and the Caribbean===

According to the 2019 [[Campbell Collaboration|Campbell Systematic Reviews]] approximately 250 million children across the world are not acquiring basic reading and math skills, even though about 50% of them have spent at least 4 years in school (UNESCO 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cl2.1067|title=What works to improve early grade literacy (EGL) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)? A systematic review and meta‐analysis, 30 December 2019, doi.org 10.1002/cl2.1067, Wiley Online Library, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, more than 60% of third‐grade students in [[Latin America and the Caribbean]] (LAC) have only achieved basic reading skills, in part because of the lack of evidence‐based training, preparation and support for teachers.

The review summarizes the findings of 107 studies of early grade literacy interventions (EGL) in LAC. They conclude that teacher training, nutrition, and technology‐in‐education programs on average do not show positive effects on EGL outcomes in the LAC region. However, some factors have the potential for positive impacts; including combining teacher training with coaching, targeting school feeding and other nutrition programs to low‐income countries with high rates of stunting and wasting, and combining technology‐in‐education programs with ''a strong focus on pedagogical practices''.

They also suggest that &quot;the quantitative nonintervention studies indicate that phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension are associated with reading ability&quot;, and that the poor reading levels of children ... &quot;may be the consequence of not providing them with adequate instructions on meta-phonological strategies and explicit and systematic phonics&quot;. However, the available studies are unable to provide conclusive evidence on the effects of teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension on reading ability, suggesting a need for even more high-quality research.

The ''Progress in International Reading Literacy Study'' ([[PIRLS]] 2016) describes the special reading initiatives in [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] (T&amp;T).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/trinidad-tobago/special-reading-initiatives/|title=PIRLS 2016, Special Reading Initiatives, Trinidad &amp; Tobago}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the National Commission for [[UNESCO]] launched the ''Leading for Literacy'' project to develop the literacy skills of grade 1 and 2 students. The project facilitates the training of primary school teachers in the use of a synthetic phonics program.

From 2013 to 2015, the T&amp;T Ministry of Education appointed seven reading specialist to help primary and secondary school teachers improve their literacy instruction. From February 2014 to January 2016, literacy coaches were hired in selected primary schools to assist teachers of kindergarten, grade 1 and grade 2 with pedagogy and content of early literacy instruction. Primary schools have been provided with literacy resources for instruction, including phonemic awareness, word recognition, vocabulary manipulatives, phonics and comprehension.

===New Zealand===

As of 2018, the Ministry of Education in [[New Zealand]] has online information to help teachers to support their students in years 1–3 in relation to sounds, letters, and words. It has specific suggestions in the areas of oral language, phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, phonemes and phonics. There are also examples and recommended books concerning phonics instruction, hearing sounds in spoken words, syllables, phoneme blending, onset and rime, and sounds and letters (initial, ending and medial). In its introduction it states that phonics instruction &quot;is not an end in itself&quot; and it is ''not'' necessary to teach students &quot;every combination of letters and sounds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literacyonline.tki.org.nz/content/download/40858/455998/file/Sound+Sense+–+Supporting+reading+and+writing+in+years+1–3.pdf|title=Sound Sense, Ministry of Education, New Zealand, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's score (523) in the 2016 [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study|PIRLS]] report on the reading achievement of fourth grade students was above the average of 500 and below other English speaking countries such as Canada (543), U.S.A. (549), England (559), Northern Ireland (565) and Ireland (567).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS student reading achievement, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===

In 2007 the Department of Education (DE) in [[Northern Ireland]] was required by law to teach children foundational skills in [[phonological awareness]] and the understanding “that words are made up of sounds and syllables and that sounds are represented by letters (phoneme/grapheme awareness)”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2007/46/pdfs/nisr_20070046_en.pdf|title=Statute2007 No. 46, Northern Ireland, pgs. 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 the DE went further by outlining a new strategy with standards requiring that teachers receive support in using [[evidence-based practices]] to teach literacy and numeracy. It outlined ten requirements, including a “systematic programme of high-quality phonics” that is explicit, structured, well-paced, interactive, engaging, and applied in a meaningful context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/de/count-read-succeed-a-strategy-to-improve-outcomes-in-literacy-and-numeracy.pdf|title=Count Read: Succeed, pg 25, N. Ireland, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Northern Ireland achieved the 7th highest score in Reading Literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS reading achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, in the PISA Reading Performance of 15-year-old students, Northern Ireland students achieved a score of 505 as compared to England at 507 and the OECD average of 487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/education/Achievement%20of%2015-year-old%20pupils%20in%20Northern%20Ireland%20PISA%202018%20National%20Report.PDF |title= Achievement of 15-year-old pupils in Northern Ireland: PISA 2018 National report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norwegian is Norway's main language and English is taught beginning in grade one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/norway/|title=PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children enter first grade in August of the year they turn age 6. The majority of students are enrolled in public school as opposed to private school.

In the Norwegian curriculum, basic skills include &quot;decoding and comprehension of simple texts&quot; (i.e. phonics). At the end of grade two students are expected to demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between &quot;speech sound and letter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.udir.no/contentassets/fd2d6bfbf2364e1c98b73e030119bd38/framework_for_basic_skills.pdf|title=Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, framework for basic skills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Norway achieved the 8th highest score in Reading Literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS reading achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20th out of 78 for 15 year-olds in [[PISA]] 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/PISA2018_CN_POL.pdf|title=PISA Norway 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===

The national curriculum of [[Poland]] considers reading to be the main goal of primary education, defining it as the technical skill of &quot;decoding graphemes into phonemes and understanding, using, and processing written texts&quot; (i.e. phonics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/poland/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/|title=PIRLS 4th grade reading curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruction often consists of telling students how things should be done instead of letting them experiment for themselves and experience the results. According to researchers, teachers seldom use the internet and other digital technologies during reading instruction. Polish schools do not have trained reading specialists, however speech and educational therapists are available to assist students with special needs or learning disabilities. In 1998 a national campaign was introduced to encourage parents to read aloud to their children for 20 minutes every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allofpolandreadstokids.org/all-of-poland-reads-to-kids#|title=All of Poland reads to kids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 10.6% of 15 year-olds had underachievement in reading, lower than the EU average of 17.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/education/tools/docs/2015/monitor15-vol-2_en.pdf|title=European Commission Education and Training Monitor 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2014, a program to provide free schoolbooks was introduced gradually across Poland. Students’ socioeconomic background was a matter of concern in 2015, and six year-olds commenced compulsory schooling in that year.

According to the 2000 International Student Assessment ([[PISA]]) 15‑year‑old Polish students read significantly below the OECD average. However, with a renewed emphasis on reading, by 2018 Poland made the most progress in reading since 1994 and Poles ages 16 to 19 exceeded their European peers in reading (10th out of 72 countries in PISA).

Poland ranked 6th in the 2016 [[PIRLS]] 4th grade reading achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS student achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s the whole language approach gained popularity in [[Portugal]], but in a non-explicit form. Emphasis was placed on meaning, reading for pleasure, and developing a critical approach to the texts. Explicit phonemic awareness and explicit training for reading fluency were considered outdated by some teachers' organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.app.pt/|title=Associação de Professores de Português: APP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor results in international comparisons led parents and schools to react to this approach and to insist on [[direct instruction]] methods. Later, during minister [[Nuno Crato]]’s tenure (2011–2015), who is known to be a vocal critic of constructivist approaches and a supporter of cognitive psychology findings, new standards (&quot;metas&quot;) were put in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dge.mec.pt/portugues|title=Metas e Programas de Português}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry convened a team led by a well-known specialist in reading, José Morais.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apprendrealire.eklablog.com/jose-morais-neurosciences-cognitives-a107656892|title=José Morais}}&lt;/ref&gt; This team introduced an explicit phonics teaching approach, putting emphasis on decoding and reading fluency.

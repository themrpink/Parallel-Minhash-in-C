==Early life and family==
Bron was born on March 14, 1938, in [[Stanmore]], [[Middlesex]], into a Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubinstein |first1=W. |last2=Jolles |first2=Michael A. |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History |date=2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-30466-6 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T_HCg17ufIC&amp;pg=PA129 |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before her birth, her father Sydney had legally changed his name from Bronstein to Bron, in an effort to enhance his newly founded commercial enterprise, Bron's Orchestral Service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bron1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Westbrook|first=Caroline|title=Gerry Bron interview|publisher=Something Jewish|date=3 April 2007|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2267_gerry_bron_interview.htm|accessdate=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her elder brother was the record producer [[Gerry Bron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dmme.net/interviews/bron.html|title=Interview with Gerry Bron|author=Epstein, Dmitry|date=November 2004|publisher=YDMME.net|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[North London Collegiate School]] and then [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], where she read Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/alumnae-news/eleanor-bron-performs-play-newnham-written-combat-dearth-roles-women-50-2/ |title=Eleanor Bron performs play at Newnham written to combat dearth of roles for women over 50 |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2020 |work=[[Newnham College, Cambridge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later characterised her time at Newnham as &quot;three years of unparalleled pampering and privilege&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Doris |last=Grumbach |title=Nonfiction in Brief |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/nonfiction-in-brief-my-oxford-my-cambridge-imogen-cunningham-pope.html |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 1979 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
Bron began her career in the [[Cambridge Footlights]] revue of 1959, entitled ''The Last Laugh'', in which [[Peter Cook]] also appeared. The addition of a female performer to the Footlights was a departure; until that time it had been all-male, with female characters portrayed in drag.

===Film appearances===
Her film appearances include the role of Ahme in [[the Beatles]]' film ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965); her name inspired [[Paul McCartney]] when he composed &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/eleanor-rigby/|title=Eleanor Rigby {{!}} The Beatles Bible|website=www.beatlesbible.com|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other roles included the doctor who grounds [[Michael Caine]]'s character in ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966), the unattainable Margaret Spencer in [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]'s film ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967), Hermione Roddice in [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969) and Sisters McFee and MacArthur in ''[[The National Health (film)|The National Health]]'' (1973).

She also appeared in the films ''[[Two for the Road (1967 film)|Two for the Road]]'' (1967) alongside [[Albert Finney]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]], and ''[[A Touch of Love (1969 film)|A Touch of Love]]'' (1969) with [[Sandy Dennis]] and [[Ian McKellen]]. She later appeared in the film adaptation of ''[[Black Beauty (1994 film)|Black Beauty]]'' (1994) and ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'' (1995).

===Television work===
Bron's earliest work for television included appearances on [[David Frost]]'s ''[[Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life]]'',&lt;ref name=SunTime10/&gt; ''[[My Father Knew Lloyd George (TV programme)|My Father Knew Lloyd George]]'' and ''[[BBC-3 (TV series)|BBC-3]]'', where she performed in sketches with [[John Fortune]]; they had already worked together at Peter Cook's [[The Establishment (club)|Establishment Club]]. Later, her work included such programmes as ''[[Where Was Spring?]]'' (1969, also alongside Fortune) and ''[[After That, This]]'' (1975) – the one with the &quot;egg&quot; timer in the opening credits.

She collaborated with novelist and playwright [[Michael Frayn]] on the [[BBC]] programmes ''[[Beyond a Joke (1972 TV series)|Beyond a Joke]]'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287834/combined |title=&quot;Beyond a Joke&quot; (1972) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Making Faces'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Understanding Michael Frayn |last=Moseley |first=Merritt |year=2006 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location=Columbia, SC |isbn=1-57003-627-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingmic00mose/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/understandingmic00mose |url-access=registration |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847353/ |title=&quot;Making Faces&quot; (TV series 1975) |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared in &quot;[[Equal Opportunities (Yes Minister)|Equal Opportunities]]&quot;, a 1982 episode of the BBC series ''[[Yes Minister]]'', playing a senior civil servant in [[Jim Hacker]]'s Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/yes-minister/equal-opportunities/episode/74549/summary.html|title=Yes, Minister: 'Equal Opportunities' episode summary|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacker plans to promote her—ostensibly to strike a blow for women's rights—only to be sorely disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/yes-minister/equal-opportunities-74549/recap/ |title=Yes, Minister: 'Equal Opportunities' episode recap |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=3 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Bron appeared as Maggie Hartley, a stage actress accused of murder, in an episode of the popular British legal series ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', entitled &quot;Rumpole and the Show Folk&quot;, which starred [[Leo McKern]] in the title role.

Bron appeared twice in ''[[Doctor Who]]''. She had a brief comedic scene in the serial ''[[City of Death]]'' (1979) alongside [[John Cleese]], which was at the suggestion of its co-writer [[Douglas Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David J.

Bron played an art critic again in 1990, appearing in the BBC sketch comedy show ''[[French and Saunders]]'' in a parody of an [[Andy Warhol]] documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/french-andamp-saunders/dangerous-liaisons/episode/148178/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;summary |title=Episode Guide &gt; Season 3, Episode 5: Dangerous Liaisons |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=30 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she made frequent appearances in [[Jennifer Saunders]]' television series ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. Bron played, via flashback, the recurring character of Patsy's mother, a woman who &quot;scattered bastard babies across Europe like a garden sprinkler&quot;.

The '''Third Council of Constantinople''', counted as the '''Sixth Ecumenical Council'''&lt;ref&gt;''Continuity and Change in Creed and Confessions'', ''Credo: Historical and Theological Guide to Creeds and Confessions of Faith'', ed. Jaroslav Pelikan (Yale University Press, 2013), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Churches, as well by certain other [[Western Christianity|Western Churches]], met in 680–681 and condemned [[monoenergism]] and [[monothelitism]] as [[heresy|heretical]] and defined [[Jesus Christ]] as having two energies and two wills (divine and human).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostrogorsky127&quot; &gt;[[George Ostrogorsky]], ''History of the Byzantine State'' (Rutgers University Press, 1995), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Monothelitism}}

The council settled a set of theological controversies that went back to the sixth century but had intensified under the emperors [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610|641}}) and [[Constans II]] ({{reign|641|668}}). Heraclius had set out to recover much of the part of his empire lost to the Persians and had attempted to bridge the controversy with [[monophysitism]], which was particularly strong in Syria and Egypt, by proposing a moderate theological position that had as good support in the tradition as any other. The result was first [[monoenergism]], i.e. that Christ, though existing in two natures (divine and human), had one energy, the second was [[monothelitism]], i.e. that Christ had one will (that is, that there was no opposition in Christ between his human and divine volition). This doctrine was accepted in most of the Byzantine world but was opposed at Jerusalem and at Rome and started a controversy that persisted even after the loss of the reconquered provinces and the death of Heraclius. When Heraclius' grandson Constans II took the throne, he saw the controversy as threatening the stability of the Empire and [[Type of Constans|attempted to silence discussion]] by outlawing speaking either in favour or against the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon'', Volume 1, transl. Richard Price and Michael Gaddis (Liverpool University Press, 2005), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Martin I]] and the monk [[Maximus the Confessor|Maximus]], the foremost opponents of monothelitism (which they interpreted as denying a human faculty of will to Christ), held a [[Lateran Council of 649|synod in Rome in 649]] that condemned monoenergism and monothelitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph N. |last=Tylenda |title=Saints and Feasts of the Liturgical Year |location= |publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=2003 |page=60 |isbn=0-87840-399-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Constantinople in around 653, some accused the Pope of supporting revolution, this was regarded as high treason, and Martin was accordingly arrested, tried, condemned and sent into exile, where he soon died. Maximus was tried and tortured to death through minor burning then ripping the skin apart.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, (995), pp. 117–18&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Maximus's position was supported by others at the Council of Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ekonomou |first=Andrew J. |author-link=Andrew J.

==Preparations==
After Constans' son and successor, [[Constantine IV]] had overcome the Muslim siege of Constantinople in 678, he immediately set his sights on restoring communion with Rome: he wrote to [[Pope Donus]] suggesting a conference on the matter. When the letter reached Rome, Donus had died, but his successor, [[Pope Agatho]], agreed to the Emperor's suggestion and ordered councils held throughout the West so that legates could present the tradition of the Western Church. There was a synod in Milan under Archbishop Mausuetus; [[Council of Hatfield|another synod]] was held in 680 at Hatfield, over which [[Theodore of Tarsus|Theodore]], Archbishop of Canterbury presided. Pope Agatho then convened a synod at Rome at Easter 680, with representatives from the regional synods.

Then he sent a delegation to meet the Easterners at Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;popes&quot;&gt;Joseph Brusher, S.J., [http://www.cfpeople.org/Books/Pope/POPEp79.htm ''Popes Through the Ages''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206180918/http://www.cfpeople.org/Books/Pope/POPEp79.htm |date=6 February 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates set out bearing two letters, one from Pope Agatho to the Emperor, and the other from the bishops of the Rome synod to those gathered in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNNEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Hefele, Karl Joseph von. ''A History of the Councils of the Church'', T. &amp; T. Clark, 1896, §313]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Constantine summoned [[Patriarch George I of Constantinople]] and all bishops of his jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] to a council. He also summoned [[Macarius I of Antioch|Patriarch Macarius of Antioch]], a Byzantine appointee permanently resident in Constantinople because of the Muslim occupation of his see.

==Proceedings==
On 7 November 680, a mere 37 bishops and a number of presbyters convened in the imperial palace, in the domed hall called the Trullus. The patriarchs of Constantinople and of Antioch participated in person, whereas the patriarchates of Alexandria and [[Jerusalem]] were represented by Byzantine appointees (because of the [[Saracen]] [[Muslim]] conquest there was at this date no patriarch in either of these sees). The Pope and a council he had held in Rome were represented (as was normal at eastern [[ecumenical council]]s) by a few priests and bishops. In its opening session, the council assumed the authority of an ecumenical council. The emperor attended and presided over the first eleven sessions, took part in the discussions and returned for the closing session on 16 September 681, attended by 151 bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostrogorsky127&quot; /&gt;

During the council, a letter by Pope Agatho was read which asserted as the traditional belief of the Church that Christ was of two wills, divine and human. Most of the bishops present accepted the letter, proclaiming that [[Apostle Peter|Peter]] spoke through Agatho,&lt;ref name=&quot;popes&quot;/&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2019}} though this council also proclaimed another historical pope as anathema. [[Macarius I of Antioch|Macarius of Antioch]] defended [[monothelitism]] but was condemned and deposed, along with his partisans. The council, in keeping with Agatho's letter, defined that [[Jesus Christ]] possessed two energies and two wills but that the human will was 'in subjection to his divine and all-powerful will'. The council carefully avoided any mention of [[Maximus the Confessor]], who was still regarded with suspicion. It condemned both [[monoenergism]] and [[monothelitism]] as [[heresy|heretical]] and included those who had supported this heresy, including [[Pope Honorius I]] and four previous patriarchs of Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostrogorsky127&quot; /&gt; When the council had concluded, the decrees were sent to Rome where they were accepted by Agatho's successor, [[Pope Leo II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;popes&quot;/&gt; In his letter of confirmation of the council, Leo accuses Honorius of &quot;profane treachery ... who did not attempt to sanctify this Apostolic Church with the teaching of Apostolic tradition.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

At some point during the council's proceedings, a Monothelite priest claimed he could raise the dead, thereby proving his faith supreme. He had a corpse brought forth, but after whispering prayers into its ears, could not revive the body.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Joseph F. &quot;Chapter Three: The Byzantine Councils.&quot; The Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church: A History.

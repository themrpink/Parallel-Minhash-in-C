Through his portrayal of Terry Malloy, Brando popularized [[method acting]] and conclusively exemplified the power of Stanislavski-based approach in cinema.

[[Al Pacino]], recounting his own memories on first seeing ''On the Waterfront'', told ''[[Playboy]]'' in a 1979 interview that he concentrated more on the lead actor than the film itself, &quot;I couldn't move. I couldn't leave the theatre.

==Home media==
{{Anchor|Video|DVD|DVD release}} The first home video release of the film was by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's &quot;Studio Heritage Collection&quot;, and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette &quot;Contender: Mastering the Method&quot;, a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]].

The 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: &quot;In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Building on the success of the film, Schulberg expanded the script into a novel titled ''Waterfront'' that was released in 1955.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The film script was adapted to stage by Schulberg. It opened on Broadway in November 1984. It included technical innovations for the time, including lasers, filmlike scenic dissolves and sounds that enveloped the audience. The story is a little different, with the motivations of Father Barry made more explicit, and the ending is less happy and more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/theater/on-the-waterfront-adapted-for-stage.html |title=On the Waterfront adapted for stage |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Eleanor Blau |date=March 20, 1984 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian films ''[[Kabzaa]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ghulam (film)|Ghulam]]'' (1998) are inspired by ''On the Waterfront''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The TV show ''On the Waterfront'' (2001) is a spoof/homage to the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Although Barlow's academic record was erratic throughout his secondary education, he &quot;had his pick of top eastern universities... simply because he was from Wyoming, where few applications originated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whowhatwhy.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whowhatwhy.org/2018/02/13/john-perry-barlows-last-words|title=John Perry Barlow's Last Words - WhoWhatWhy|date=February 13, 2018|website=whowhatwhy.org|access-date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he graduated with high honors in [[comparative religion]] from [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. He claimed to have served as the University's student body president until the administration &quot;tossed him into a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]&quot; following a drug-induced attempted [[suicide attack]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whowhatwhy.org&quot;/&gt; Following two weeks of rehabilitation, he successfully returned to his studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;whowhatwhy.org&quot;/&gt; In his senior year, he became a part-time resident of [[New York City]]'s [[East Village (Manhattan)|East Village]] and immersed himself in [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[The Factory|Factory]] demimonde, cultivating a friendship with [[Rene Ricard]] and a brief addiction to [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrmWDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=ricard|title=Mother American Night: My Life in Crazy Times|first1=John Perry|last1=Barlow|first2=Robert|last2=Greenfield|date=May 28, 2019|publisher=Crown Archetype|isbn=9781524760199|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he neared graduation, Barlow was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]] and contracted to write a novel by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] at the behest of his mentor, the autodidactic [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist and historian [[Paul Horgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com&quot;&gt;McEnteer, James (June 2, 2018).

==Career==
===Grateful Dead===
At age 15, Barlow became a student at the [[Fountain Valley School]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. While there, he met [[Bob Weir]], who would later join the [[Grateful Dead]]. Weir and Barlow maintained their close friendship through the years.

As a frequent visitor during college to [[Timothy Leary]]'s facility in [[Millbrook, New York]], Barlow was introduced to [[LSD]]; he later claimed to have consumed the substance on over one thousand occasions throughout his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;whowhatwhy.org&quot;/&gt; These transformative experiences led Barlow to distance himself from Mormonism. He went on to facilitate the first meeting between the Grateful Dead and the Leary organization (who recognized each other as kindred souls in spite of their respective philosophical approaches) in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of4J2dbKvMoC&amp;q=john+barlow+leary&amp;pg=PA642|title=Timothy Leary: A Biography|first=Robert|last=Greenfield|date=February 7, 2018|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0151005000|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on his way to [[California]] to reunite with the Grateful Dead in 1971, he stopped at his family's ranch, though had not intended to stay. His father had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1966 before dying in 1972, resulting in a $700,000 business debt. Barlow ended up changing his plans, and began practicing [[animal husbandry]] under the auspices of the Bar Cross Land and Livestock Company in [[Cora, Wyoming]], for almost two decades. To support the ranch, he continued to write and sell [[spec scripts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whowhatwhy.org&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, Barlow was still able to play an active role in the Grateful Dead while recruiting many unconventional part-time ranch hands from the mainstream as well as the [[counterculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookephoto.com/jpb.html|title=John Perry Barlow Portfolio|website=Cookephoto.com|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417115103/http://www.cookephoto.com/jpb.html|archive-date=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death in 2018, [[John Byrne Cooke]] intended to produce a documentary film (provisionally titled ''The Bar Cross Ranch'') that documented this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Byrne Cooke|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-byrne-cooke/99/962/182|title=John Byrne Cooke|publisher=LinkedIn|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WikipediaBarlow20060529.png|thumb|Barlow orating at the [[European Graduate School]] of [[Leuk|Leuk, Switzerland]] in 2006]]
Barlow became interested in collaborating with Weir at a Grateful Dead show at the [[Capitol Theatre (Port Chester, New York)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[Port Chester, New York]], in February 1971. Until then, Weir had mostly worked with resident Dead lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]. Hunter preferred that those who sang his songs stick to his &quot;canonical&quot; lyrics rather than improvising additions or rearranging words. A feud erupted backstage over a couplet in &quot;[[Sugar Magnolia]]&quot; from the band's most recent release (most likely &quot;She can dance a Cajun rhythm/Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive&quot;), culminating in a disgruntled Hunter summoning Barlow and telling him &quot;take [Weir]—he's yours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McNally|first=Dennis|title=A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead|page=394|publisher=Broadway|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1971, with a deal for [[Ace (Bob Weir album)|a solo album]] in hand and only two songs completed, Weir and Barlow began to write together for the first time. They co-wrote such songs such as &quot;[[Cassidy (song)|Cassidy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mexicali Blues (song)|Mexicali Blues]]&quot; and &quot;[[Black-Throated Wind]]&quot;, all three of which would remain in the repertoires of the Grateful Dead and of Weir's varied solo projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ace-mw0000195158|title=Ace - Bob Weir|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717041823/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ace-mw0000195158|archive-date=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow subsequently collaborated with Grateful Dead keyboardist [[Brent Mydland]], a partnership that culminated in four songs on 1989's ''[[Built to Last]]''. He also wrote one song (&quot;The Devil I Know&quot;) with [[Vince Welnick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/built-to-last-mw0000198496|title=Built to Last - Grateful Dead|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823095811/http://www.allmusic.com/album/built-to-last-mw0000198496|archive-date=August 23, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet activism===
[[File:Nicholas Negroponte and John Perry Barlow.jpg|thumb|Barlow with [[Nicholas Negroponte]]]]
In 1986, Barlow joined [[The WELL]], an online community then known for a strong [[Deadhead]] presence. He served on the company's board of directors for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/07/technology/john-perry-barlow-obit/index.html|title=Internet rights advocate John Perry Barlow dies|work=CNN|date=7 February 2018|access-date=8 February 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208014251/http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/07/technology/john-perry-barlow-obit/index.html|archive-date=February 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Barlow founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) along with fellow digital-rights activists [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Mitch Kapor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/about/history|title=A History of Protecting Freedom Where Law and Technology Collide|website=The Electronic Frontier Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104113542/https://www.eff.org/about/history|archive-date=January 4, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a founder of EFF, Barlow helped publicize the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raid on [[Steve Jackson Games]]. His involvement is later documented in ''[[The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier]]'' (1992) by [[Bruce Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|bullet=none|no=101|last=Sterling|first=Bruce|year=1992|name=The Hacker Crackdown, law and disorder on the electronic frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFF later sponsored the ground-breaking case ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]'' in support of Steve Jackson Games. Steve Jackson Games won the case in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5801427/the-day-the-secret-service-raided-a-role-playing-game-company|title=The Day the Secret Service Raided a Role-Playing Game Company|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=May 13, 2011|access-date=February 7, 2018|work=[[Kotaku]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028051101/http://kotaku.com/5801427/the-day-the-secret-service-raided-a-role-playing-game-company|archive-date=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Barlow was invited to speak about his work in [[cyberspace]] to a middle school classroom at [[North Shore Country Day School]]. This event was highly influential upon the life of then-student [[Aaron Swartz]]: Swartz's father Robert recalls Aaron coming home that day a changed person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronswartzday.org/john-perry-barlow-recalls-a-12-year-old-aaron-swartz|title=John Perry Barlow Recalls A 12 year-old Aaron Swartz|website=Aaronswartzday.org|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329162813/http://www.aaronswartzday.org/john-perry-barlow-recalls-a-12-year-old-aaron-swartz/|archive-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JPBarlow/status/574421283431043072|title=John Perry Barlow|work=Twitter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208090408/https://twitter.com/JPBarlow/status/574421283431043072|archive-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Barlow met the recently appointed Brazilian Minister of Culture [[Gilberto Gil]] at the event Tactic Media Brazil to discuss the perspectives of digital inclusion and political participation, which in the following years would help shape Brazilian governmental policy on intellectual property and digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturadigital.br/braziliandigitalculture/gilberto-gil-and-john-perry-barlow-will-meet-again-at-the-brazilian-digital-culture-forum/|title=Gilberto Gil and John Perry Barlow will meet again at the II Brazilian Digital Culture Forum|website=Culturadigital.br|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195952/http://culturadigital.br/braziliandigitalculture/gilberto-gil-and-john-perry-barlow-will-meet-again-at-the-brazilian-digital-culture-forum/|archive-date=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html|title=Gilberto Gil Hears the Future, Some Rights Reserved|date=March 11, 2007|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605045115/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html|archive-date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the two began working together to expand the availability and variety of Brazilian music to remix and share online. At the same time, being one of the &quot;[[digerati]]&quot;, Barlow was among the very first users of the invitation-only social network [[Orkut]] at its inception. He decided to send all of his 100 invitations to friends in Brazil; two years later, some 11 million internet users in that country (out of 14 million total) were on the social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jruv/why-brazil-is-actually-winning-the-internet#.dk20AqxXD|title=Why Brazil Is Actually Winning The Internet|work=BuzzFeed|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017043349/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jruv/why-brazil-is-actually-winning-the-internet#.dk20AqxXD|archive-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
From 1971 to 1995, Barlow wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead, mostly through his relationship with Bob Weir. Barlow's songs include &quot;Cassidy&quot; (about [[Neal Cassady]] and Cassidy Law),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|title=Cassidy's Tale|url=http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html|publisher =Literary Kicks: Beat Connections in Music|access-date =November 12, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023062542/http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html|archive-date =October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Estimated Prophet&quot;, &quot;Black-Throated Wind&quot;, &quot;Hell in a Bucket&quot;, &quot;Mexicali Blues&quot;, &quot;The Music Never Stopped&quot; and &quot;Throwing Stones&quot;.

Barlow wrote extensively for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, as well as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Nerve (website)|Nerve]]'', and ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. In his writings, he explained the wonder of the Internet. The Internet to him was more than a computer network; he called it an &quot;electronic frontier.&quot;{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=17}} &quot;He frequently wrote in language that echoed [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s African diary. 'Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business you never heard of can own the history of your personal affairs.'&quot;{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|pp=17–18}}

His writings include &quot;[[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace]]&quot;, which was written in response to the enactment of the [[Communications Decency Act]] in 1996 as the EFF saw the law as a threat to the independence and sovereignty of cyberspace. He argued that the cyberspace legal order would reflect the ethical deliberation of the community instead of the coercive power that characterized real-space governance.{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=20}} Since online &quot;identities have no bodies&quot;, they found it inappropriate to obtain order in the cyberspace by physical coercion.&lt;ref name=&quot;declaration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Internet_censorship_bills/barlow_0296.declaration|title=A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace|access-date=February 9, 2007|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|author-link=John Perry Barlow|date=February 8, 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028001921/http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Internet_censorship_bills/barlow_0296.declaration |archive-date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ethics, [[enlightened self-interest]] and the commonwealth were the elements they believed to create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=20}}

In his 1990 piece &quot;Crime and Puzzlement: in advance of the law on the electronic frontier&quot;, Barlow wrote about his first-hand experience with Phiber Optik ([[Mark Abene]]) and Acid Phreak ([[Elias Ladopoulos]]) from the hacker group [[Masters of Deception]], and mentioned [[Kevin Mitnick]]—all of whom were engaged in [[phone phreaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html|title=Crime and Puzzlement: in advance of the law on the electronic frontier.|work=Whole Earth Review (Fall 1990): 44–57|access-date=March 10, 2015|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|author-link=John Perry Barlow|date=June 8, 1990|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html|archive-date=October 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title alludes to ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/stf/HackersEncyclope2.0.html|title=Hacker's Encyclopedia|website=Insecure.org|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527042429/http://insecure.org/stf/HackersEncyclope2.0.html|archive-date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow is credited with popularizing of the concept of [[Pronoia (psychology)|pronoia]] (defined as the opposite of [[paranoia]]) and was considered a celebrity ally of the [[Zippy Pronoia Tour]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronoia.net/def.html|title=Pronoia (definition)|website=Pronoia.net|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402211916/http://pronoia.net/def.html|archive-date=April 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronoia.net/tour/faq/faq_zippies.html|title=Zippy Pronoia Tour /Zippy FAQ|website=Pronoia.net|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329092556/http://www.pronoia.net/tour/faq/faq_zippies.html|archive-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Barlow wrote the article &quot;Africa Rising: Everything You Know About Africa Is Wrong&quot; for ''Wired'', which documented the start of his extensive travels as he worked to expand Internet access across the continent: &quot;I went from Mombasa to Tombouctou, experiencing various parts of [[Kenya]], [[Ghana]], the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Mali]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga volcano area]] where Uganda, [[Rwanda]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]] meet. Part of the idea was that I would attempt to email ''Wired'' a series of dispatches on my travels. The act of finding a port into cyberspace would be part of the adventure… Before I left, I believed Africans could proceed directly from the agricultural epoch into an information economy without having to submit to the dreary indignities and social pathologies of industrialization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/6.01/barlow.html|title=Africa Rising|author=John Perry Barlow|date=January 1, 1998|work=WIRED|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112234857/http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/6.01/barlow.html|archive-date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow also returned to writing lyrics, most recently with [[The String Cheese Incident]]'s mandolinist and vocalist [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]], including their song &quot;Desert Dawn&quot;. Barlow was seen many times with [[Carolyn Garcia]] (whose monologue is dubbed on the eponymous track &quot;Mountain Girl&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/4071/STRING-CHEESE-INCIDENT-UNTYING-THE-NOT|title=Music News &amp; Concert Review|work=JamBase|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134035/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/4071/STRING-CHEESE-INCIDENT-UNTYING-THE-NOT|archive-date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at their concerts mixing with the fans and members in the band, and was a close friend of String Cheese Incident producer [[Jerry Harrison]]. He also participated with the [[Chicago]]-based [[jam band]] [[Mr. Blotto]] on their release ''Barlow Shanghai''. Barlow was a spiritual mentor and student of [[Kemp Muhl]] and [[Sean Lennon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoastt.com/bio.html|title=THE GOASTT|website=Thegoastt.com|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328145016/http://thegoastt.com/bio.html|archive-date=March 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborating with their band [[The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger]] and making a cameo in their 2014 music video &quot;Animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhcR4rdzzoM|title=[HD] The GOASTT (The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger) – &quot;Animals&quot;|date=April 10, 2014|publisher=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120182629/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhcR4rdzzoM|archive-date=November 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barlow's writings that has remained in circulation is his &quot;Principles of Adult Behavior&quot;, which he penned in 1977 on the eve of his 30th birthday and which he continued to use to describe his approach to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988568/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-obituary-electronic-frontier-foundation | title = Internet pioneer John Perry Barlow is dead at 70 | first = Russell | last = Brandom | date = February 7, 2018 | access-date = February 7, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208090408/https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988568/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-obituary-electronic-frontier-foundation | archive-date = February 8, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kgmes/i_am_john_perry_barlow_cofounder_of_the/|title=I am John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lyricist for the Grateful Dead.

Seek to define your mission and pursue that&quot;, since that was counter to prevailing thought and &quot;un-American&quot;. Barlow saw this more as a way to challenge how one perceived their life, their job, and their goals in life, and to not see achieving happiness as &quot;an obligation [one owes] to Jefferson, the United States, or God Itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes asap&quot;/&gt;

===Politics===
Barlow had been chairman of the [[Sublette County, Wyoming|Sublette County]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]],{{when?|date=February 2020}} and served as western Wyoming campaign coordinator for [[Dick Cheney]]’s 1978 Congressional campaign. 

Barlow was president of the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] from 1978 to 1984. 

He was{{when?|date=February 2020}} chairman of the Sublette County Master Plan Design Commission and served on the Sublette County Planning and Zoning Commission for many years; in that capacity, he was one of five ranchers who administered water distribution in the New Fork Irrigation District (an area of nearly 100,000 acres serving about 35 ranchers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conference|contribution = New York city speakers: Barlow|format=PDF|date=June 2010|url=http://personaldemocracy.com/pdf-conference-2010-june-3-5-new-york-city-speakers#barlow|publisher=Personal democracy|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527042208/http://personaldemocracy.com/pdf-conference-2010-june-3-5-new-york-city-speakers%23assange#barlow|archive-date=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had lauded Cheney as &quot;the smartest man I've ever met [with] the possible exception of [[Bill Gates]]&quot;, Barlow subsequently renounced Cheney prior to his Vice Presidency, owing to his perceived repudiation of environmental and civil-rights issues in Congress. Barlow opined that &quot;Dick's votes… were parts of complex deals aimed at enhancing his own power… [H]e has the least interest in human beings of anyone I have ever met.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://washingtonmonthly.com/2003/11/09/a-profile-of-dick-cheney|title=A Profile of Dick Cheney|magazine=Washington Monthly|access-date=March 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104193002/http://washingtonmonthly.com/2003/11/09/a-profile-of-dick-cheney|archive-date=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=T.D.

By the early 2000s, Barlow was unable to reconcile his ardent [[libertarianism]] with the prevailing [[neoconservative]] movement, and &quot;didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush&quot;. In 2004, he said that he was &quot;voting for [[John Kerry]], though with little enthusiasm&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;reason&quot;/&gt; 

Contemporaneously, he characterized cocaine derogatorily as a &quot;Republican drug&quot; that &quot;makes its users self-obsessed, aggressive, and greedy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shift.newco.co/2018/02/08/barlows-turn-of-phrase/|title=Newco Shift - Barlow's Turn of Phrase|date=February 8, 2018|website=Newco Shift}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barlow subsequently stated that he remained a Republican, most notably during an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on March 26, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Colbert Report|date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/a19udk/john-perry-barlow|title=John Perry Barlow – Video Clip|website=Thecolbertreport.cc.com|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703153131/http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/a19udk/john-perry-barlow|archive-date=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed on many{{vague|date=February 2020}} occasions to be an [[anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=John Perry (interviewee)|last2=Jayakar|first2=Roshni (interviewer)|title=What stops free flow of information is dangerous|url=http://www.india-today.com/btoday/20001206/interview.html|work=Business Today|publisher=Living Media India|date=December 6, 2000|access-date=November 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009235727/http://www.india-today.com/btoday/20001206/interview.html|archive-date=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

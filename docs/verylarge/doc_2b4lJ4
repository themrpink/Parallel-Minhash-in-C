On February 11, 2009, a document called ''Drugs and democracy in Latin America: Towards a paradigm shift '' was signed by several Latin American political figures, intellectuals, writers and journalists as commissioners of the [[Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy]]. The document questions the war on drugs and points out its [[Drug policy of the United States#Effects|failures]]. It also indicates that prohibition has come with an extensive social cost, especially to the countries that take part in the production of illicit drugs. Although controversial, the document does not endorse either the production or consumption of drugs but recommends for both a new and an alternative approach. The document argues that drug production and consumption has become a social [[taboo]] that inhibits the public debate because of its relationship to crime and as consequence it confines consumers to a small circle where they become more vulnerable to the actions of organized crime. The authors also demand for a close review to the prohibitive strategies of the [[Drug policy of the United States|United States]] and the study of the advantages and limits of the damage reduction strategy followed by the European Union. The proposal uses three paradigms as an alternative:
* The [[Drug addiction|treatment]] of consumption as a problem of [[public health]].
* The reduction of consumption through the dissemination of information and prevention.
* A new focus towards organized crime.
The document favors the European policies towards drug consumption since according to the authors it is more humane and efficient. The signers of this document are: [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], [[Ernesto Zedillo]], [[César Gaviria]], [[Paulo Coelho]], Enrique Santos, [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Moisés Naím]], [[Tomas Eloy Martinez]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120729165834/http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/politica/guerra-contra-las-drogas-fracaso-y-debe-ser-replanteada-afirman-ex-presidentes-e-intelectuales-_4808480-1 &quot;Estrategia de guerra contra las drogas en América Latina debe ser rectificada, sugiere informe&quot;] ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]''. February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later in mid-2011, the core of the Initiative and its commission were extended and endorsed in a report issued by the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]]. Joining the three former presidents of Colombia, Brazil and Mexico and [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] winner Llosa on the Global Commission were former U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[George Shultz|George P. Shultz]] and [[Federal Reserve]] chair [[Paul Volcker]]; [[Carlos Fuentes]], Mexican writer and public intellectual; [[John C. Whitehead]], formerly of [[Goldman Sachs]]; and [[Kofi Annan]], former Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Tharoor, Ishaan, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2075679,00.html &quot;Report: The Global War on Drugs Has Failed.

Retrieved: 14 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-temperature superconductivity==
=== Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)===
The biggest application for superconductivity is in producing the large-volume, stable, and high-intensity magnetic fields required for MRI and NMR.  This represents a multi-billion-US$ market for companies such as [[Oxford Instruments]] and [[Siemens]].  The magnets typically use [[Conventional superconductor|low-temperature superconductors]] (LTS) because [[high-temperature superconductors]] are not yet cheap enough to cost-effectively deliver the high, stable, and large-volume fields required, notwithstanding the need to cool LTS instruments to [[liquid helium]] temperatures.  Superconductors are also used in high field scientific magnets.

===Particle accelerators and magnetic fusion devices===
[[Particle accelerator]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] can include many high field electromagnets requiring large quantities of LTS. To construct the LHC magnets required more than 28 percent of the world's [[niobium-titanium]] wire production for five years, with large quantities of NbTi also used in the magnets for the LHC's huge experiment detectors.&lt;ref name=LHC-2010&gt;[http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2010/09/10/superconductors-future/ Superconductors Face the Future. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of magnetic fusion devices (mostly [[tokamak]]s) have used SC coils. The current construction of [[ITER]] has required unprecedented amounts of LTS (e.g. 500 tonnes, causing a 7 fold increase in the world's annual production capacity).&lt;ref name=ITER-magnets&gt;[http://www.iter.org/mach/magnets ITER Magnets]&lt;/ref&gt;

== High-temperature superconductivity (HTS) ==
The commercial applications so far for [[High-temperature superconductivity|high temperature superconductors]] (HTS) have been limited.

HTS require only [[liquid nitrogen]], not [[liquid helium]], to cool to superconducting temperatures.  However, the problem with HTS technology is that the currently known high temperature superconductors are brittle ceramics which are expensive to manufacture and not easily formed into wires or other useful shapes.&lt;ref&gt;See for example L. R. Lawrence et al: [http://web.ornl.gov/sci/htsc/documents/pdf/prodben.pdf &quot;High Temperature Superconductivity: The Products and their Benefits&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908120648/http://web.ornl.gov/sci/htsc/documents/pdf/prodben.pdf |date=2014-09-08 }} (2002) Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the applications for HTS have been where it has some other intrinsic advantage, e.g. in
* low thermal loss current leads for LTS devices (low thermal conductivity),
* RF and microwave filters (low resistance to RF), and 
* increasingly in specialist scientific magnets, particularly where size and electricity consumption are critical (while HTS wire is much more expensive than LTS in these applications, this can be offset by the relative cost and convenience of cooling); the ability to ramp field is desired (the higher and wider range of HTS's [[operating temperature]] means faster changes in field can be managed); or cryogen free operation is desired (LTS generally requires [[liquid helium]] that is becoming more scarce and expensive).

=== HTS-based systems ===
HTS has application in scientific and industrial magnets, including use in NMR and MRI systems.  Commercial systems are now available in each category.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.hts-110.com HTS-110 Ltd] and [http://www.paramedmedicalsystems.com Paramed Medical Systems ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--accessed July 9, 2009--&gt;

Also one intrinsic attribute of HTS is that it can withstand much higher magnetic fields than LTS, so HTS at liquid helium temperatures are being explored for very high-field inserts inside LTS magnets.

Promising future industrial and commercial HTS applications include [[Induction heater]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[fault current limiter]]s, [[power storage]], [[Electric motor|motor]]s and [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactors (see [[ITER]]) and [[magnetic levitation]] devices.

Early applications will be where the benefit of smaller size, lower weight or the ability to rapidly switch current (fault current limiters) outweighs the added cost. Longer-term as conductor price falls HTS systems should be competitive in a much wider range of applications on energy efficiency grounds alone.  (For a relatively technical and US-centric view of state of play of HTS technology in power systems and the development status of Generation 2 conductor see [http://www.htspeerreview.com/2008/agenda.html ''Superconductivity for Electric Systems 2008 US DOE Annual Peer Review''].)

===Electric power transmission===
==== Holbrook Superconductor Project ====
The [[Holbrook Superconductor Project]] is a project to design and build the world's first production [[superconductor|superconducting]] [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] power cable.  The cable was commissioned in late June 2008.  The suburban [[Long Island]] electrical substation is fed by about 600-meter-long underground cable system consists of about 99 miles of [[high-temperature superconductors|high-temperature superconductor wire]] manufactured by [[American Superconductor]], installed underground and chilled with [[liquid nitrogen]] greatly reducing the costly right-of-way required to deliver additional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tres Amigas renewable energy market hub will be a multi-mile, triangular electricity pathway of superconductor electricity pipelines capable of transferring and balancing many gigawatts of power between three U.S. power grids (the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection and the Texas Interconnection). Unlike traditional powerlines, it will transfer power as DC instead of AC current. It will be located in Clovis, New Mexico.

==== Essen inner city ====
[[Essen, Germany]] has the world's longest superconducting power cable in production at 1 kilometer.  It is a 10 kV liquid nitrogen cooled cable. The cable is smaller than an equivalent 110 kV regular cable and the lower voltage has the additional benefit of smaller transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Diarmaid |title=Nexans success in Essen may see roll-out in other cities |url=https://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2016/01/nexans-success-in-essen-may-see-roll-out-in-other-cities.html |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=[[Power Engineering (magazine)|Power Engineering]] |date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/de/1892498/data/1301026/3/rwe-deutschland-ag/energiewende/intelligente-netze/ampacity/Projektbroschuere.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108014001/http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/de/1892498/data/1301026/3/rwe-deutschland-ag/energiewende/intelligente-netze/ampacity/Projektbroschuere.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-11-08|title=Ein Leuchtturmprojekt für den effizienten Stromtransport|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voerde aluminium plant ====
An aluminium plant in [[Voerde]], Germany plans to use superconductors for cables carrying 200 kA, citing lower volume and material demand as advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://demo200.de/|title=Demo200|accessdate=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.alu-web.de/erste-aluminiumhuette-setzt-auf-nachhaltige-supraleitertechnologie/|title=Trimet in Voerde setzt auf nachhaltige Supraleitertechnologie|language=German|date=2020-02-04|accessdate=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnesium diboride ===
[[Magnesium diboride]] is a much cheaper superconductor than either [[BSCCO]] or [[YBCO]] in terms of cost per current-carrying capacity per length (cost/(kA*m)), in the same ballpark as LTS, and on this basis many manufactured wires are already cheaper than copper.  Furthermore, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superconducts at temperatures higher than LTS (its critical temperature is 39&amp;nbsp;K, compared with less than 10&amp;nbsp;K for NbTi and 18.3&amp;nbsp;K for Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn), introducing the possibility of using it at 10-20&amp;nbsp;K in cryogen-free magnets or perhaps eventually in liquid hydrogen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is limited in the magnetic field it can tolerate at these higher temperatures, so further research is required to demonstrate its competitiveness in higher field applications.

===Trapped field magnets===
Exposing superconducting materials to a brief magnetic field can trap the field for use in machines such as generators. In some applications they could replace traditional permanent magnets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utexas.edu/research/cem/trapped_field_program.html Trapped field magnet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2016-04-physicists-flaws-superconductor-theory.html#nRlv Physicists discover flaws in superconductor theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=828376 Trapped field magnets of high-T/sub c/ superconductors]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|PC}} (24 June 1532{{#tag:ref|There is a popular tradition that Robert Dudley was the same age as [[Elizabeth I]]; however, in a letter to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] he denotes 24 June as his birthday, and a 1576 portrait miniature by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] gives his age as 44, &quot;so 1532 is the most likely year of his birth&quot; (Adams 2008b).|group=&quot;note&quot;}} – 4 September 1588) was an English statesman and the [[favourite]] of [[Elizabeth I]] from her accession until his death. He was a suitor for the Queen's hand for many years.

Dudley's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father, the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], had failed to prevent the accession of [[Mary I]]. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] under Mary's husband and co-ruler, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], which led to his full rehabilitation. On Elizabeth I's accession in November 1558, Dudley was appointed [[Master of the Horse]]. In October 1562, he became a [[Privy Council of England|Privy Councillor]] and, in 1587, was appointed [[Lord Steward]] of the [[Royal Household]]. In 1564, Dudley became Earl of Leicester and, from 1563, one of the greatest landowners in [[North Wales]] and the English [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] by royal grants.

Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was one of Elizabeth's leading statesmen, involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and [[Francis Walsingham]]. Although he refused to be married to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Dudley was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he strongly advocated for her execution. As [[Patronage|patron]] of the [[History of the Puritans under Elizabeth I|Puritan movement]], he supported [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|non-conforming]] preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the [[Church of England]]. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1585–87). His acceptance of the post of [[Governor-General]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures and was one of the main backers of [[Francis Drake]] and other [[explorer]]s and [[privateer]]s. During the [[Spanish Armada]], the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at [[Tilbury]]. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat [[Kenilworth Castle]] in 1575 on occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Dudley was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the [[Elizabethan theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Haynes 1992 p. 12; Wilson 1981 pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Dudley's private life interfered with his court career and ''vice versa''. When his first wife, [[Amy Robsart]], fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560, he was free to marry the Queen. However, the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect. Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife's death continued throughout his life, despite the [[coroner's jury]]'s verdict of accident. For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth's sake and when he finally did, his new wife, [[Lettice Knollys]], was permanently banished from court. This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 pp. 145, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the child's death in 1584, a virulent libel known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'' was circulated in England. It laid the foundation of a literary and [[historiographical]] tradition that often depicted the Earl as the [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] &quot;master courtier&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2002 p. 52&quot;&gt;Adams 2002 p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I. More recent research has led to a reassessment of his place in [[Elizabethan government]] and [[Elizabethan era|society]].

==Youth==

===Education and marriage===
Robert Dudley was the fifth son of [[John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland]], and his wife [[Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland|Jane]], daughter of [[Edward Guilford|Sir Edward Guildford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;Adams 2008b&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Dudley]], had been an adviser to King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and was executed for treason in 1510 by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  John and Jane Dudley had 13 children in all and were known for their happy family life.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Among the siblings' tutors figured [[John Dee]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]], and [[Roger Ascham]].&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ascham believed that Robert Dudley possessed a rare talent for languages and writing, regretting that his pupil had done himself harm by preferring mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 p. 55; Adams 2008b&lt;/ref&gt; Robert learned the craft of the courtier at the courts of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and especially [[Edward VI]], among whose companions he served.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 pp. 23, 28–29; Adams 2008b; Loades 1996 p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1549 Robert Dudley participated in crushing [[Kett's Rebellion]] and probably first met [[Amy Robsart]], whom he was to wed on 4 June 1550 in the presence of the young King Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 pp. 31, 33, 44&lt;/ref&gt; She was of the same age as the bridegroom and the daughter and heiress of Sir John Robsart, a [[Landed gentry|gentleman-farmer]] of [[Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 pp. 135, 159&lt;/ref&gt; It was a love-match, the young couple depending heavily on their fathers' gifts, especially Robert's. John Dudley, who since early 1550 effectively ruled England, was pleased to strengthen his influence in Norfolk by his son's marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 pp. 179, 225, 285; Haynes 1987 pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Robert, as he was styled as a [[duke]]'s son, became an important local gentleman and served as a Member of Parliament for [[Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|Norfolk]] in 1551–52, March 1553 and 1559.&lt;ref&gt;Virgoe 1982 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; His court career went on in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 pp. 225–226; Wilson 1981 pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemned and pardoned===
On 6 July 1553 [[King Edward&amp;nbsp;VI]] died and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to transfer the English crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]], who was married to his second youngest son, [[Lord Guildford Dudley]].&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 pp. 256–257, 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Dudley led a force of 300 into Norfolk where Edward's half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]] was assembling her followers. After some ten days in the county and securing several towns for Jane, he took [[King's Lynn]] and proclaimed her in the market-place.&lt;ref&gt;Ives 2009 pp. 199, 209; Haynes 1987 pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 19 July, Jane's reign was over in London. Soon, the townsmen of King's Lynn seized Robert Dudley and the rest of his small troop and sent him to [[Framlingham Castle]] before Mary I.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes 1987 pp. 23–24; Chamberlin 1939 p. 68, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Dudley was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[attainted]], and condemned to death, as were his father and four brothers. His father went to the scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 pp. 266, 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tower, Dudley's stay coincided with the imprisonment of his childhood friend,&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2002 p. 134&quot;&gt;Adams 2002 p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Edward and Mary's half-sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], who was sent there on suspicion of involvement in [[Wyatt's rebellion]]. Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554. The surviving brothers were released in the autumn; working for their release, their mother (who died in January 1555) and their brother-in-law, [[Henry Sidney]], had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], Mary's husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] held to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there,&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands,&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and in March of the same year Dudley was at [[Calais]] where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip's return to England.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 158; Wilson 1981 p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Ambrose]], Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for Philip&amp;nbsp;II at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] in August 1557.&lt;ref&gt;Loades 1996 pp. 238, 273&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a [[Round shot|cannonball]]—according to Robert, before his own eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 134; Chamberlin 1939 pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; All surviving Dudley children—Ambrose and Robert with their sisters [[Mary Dudley, Lady Sidney|Mary]] and [[Katherine Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Katherine]]—were restored in blood by Mary I's next [[Parliament of England|parliament]] in 1558.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2002 p. 134&quot;/&gt;

==Royal favourite==

[[File:Coronation Procession of Elizabeth I of England 1559.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Elizabeth's coronation procession: Robert Dudley is on horseback on the far left, leading the [[palfrey]] of honour.]]

Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth's special friends by Philip&amp;nbsp;II's envoy to the English court a week before Queen Mary's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2002 p. 134&quot;/&gt; On 18 November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth's accession, Dudley witnessed the surrender of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] to her at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]]. He became [[Master of the Horse]] on the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. It suited him, as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing a large part of the Queen's [[Coronation (United Kingdom)|coronation]] festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 pp. 78, 83–92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth I Coronation Miniature.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth I]] Coronation Miniature]]
In April 1559 Dudley was elected a [[Knight of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before, Philip II had been informed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night. People talk of this so freely that they go so far as to say that his wife has a malady in one of her breasts{{#tag:ref|&quot;está muy mala de un pecho&quot; (&quot;she is very ill in one breast&quot;), in the original Spanish (Adams 1995 p. 63).|group=&quot;note&quot;}} and the Queen is only waiting for her to die to marry Lord Robert ... Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty's behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1892–1899 Vol.&amp;nbsp;I pp. 57–58; Wilson 1981 p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a month the Spanish ambassador, [[Gomez Suarez de Figueroa of Cordova, 1st Duke of Feria|Count de Feria]], counted Robert Dudley among three persons who ran the country.{{#tag:ref|The others he listed were [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and his brother-in-law [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]] (Chamberlin 1939 p. 101).|group=&quot;note&quot;}} Visiting foreigners of [[princely]] rank were bidding for his goodwill. He acted as official host on state occasions and was himself a frequent guest at ambassadorial dinners.&lt;ref&gt;Owen 1980 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By the autumn of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen's hand; their impatient envoys came under the impression that Elizabeth was fooling them, &quot;keeping Lord Robert's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore 2010 pp. 166, 162&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Lord Robert&quot;, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra was convinced, was the man &quot;in whom it is easy to recognise the king that is to be ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the nobility would not brook Dudley's new prominence, as they could not &quot;put up with his being King.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 116–117; Doran 1996 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to kill the [[favourite]] abounded,&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1995 p. 78; Wilson 1981 p. 100; Chamberlin 1939 p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and Dudley took to wearing a light [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]] under his clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1995 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Among all classes, in England and abroad, gossip got under way that the Queen had children by Dudley—such rumours never quite ended for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 p. 114; Doran 1996 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amy Dudley's death===
{{further|Amy Robsart}}
Already in April 1559 court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Dudley from her side;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2005 p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; but her favour did not extend to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Dudley lived in different parts of the country since her ancestral [[manor house]] was uninhabitable.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1995 pp. 380–382&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband visited her for four days at Easter 1559 and she spent a month around London in the early summer of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1995 p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; They never saw each other again; Dudley was with the Queen at [[Windsor Castle]] and possibly planning a visit to her, when his wife was found dead at her residence [[Cumnor|Cumnor Place]] near [[Oxford]] on 8 September 1560:&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1995 p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There came to me Bowes, by whom I do understand that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall from a pair of stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Robert Dudley.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Robert Dudley c.&amp;nbsp;1560]]
Retiring to his house at [[Kew]], away from court as from the putative [[crime scene]], he pressed for an impartial inquiry which had already begun in the form of an [[inquest]].&lt;ref&gt;Doran 1996 p. 43; Skidmore 2010 p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found that it was an accident: Lady Dudley, staying alone &quot;in a certain chamber&quot;, had fallen down the adjoining stairs, sustaining two [[head injuries]] and breaking her neck.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore 2010 p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely suspected that Dudley had arranged his wife's death to be able to marry the Queen. The scandal played into the hands of nobles and politicians who desperately tried to prevent Elizabeth from marrying him.&lt;ref&gt;Owen 1980 p. 10; Doran 1996 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians have considered murder to be unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doran 1996 p. 44&quot;&gt;Doran 1996 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner's report came to light in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2011; Skidmore 2010 pp. 230–233&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of the [[forensic]] findings of 1560, it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanation&lt;ref&gt;Doran 1996 pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;—on the basis of near-contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck, her headdress still standing undisturbed &quot;upon her head&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins 2002 p. 65&quot;&gt;Jenkins 2002 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in the libel ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'' of 1584 and has ever since been repeated for a fact.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2002 p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill, it was suggested in 1956 by [[Ian Aird]], a professor of surgery, that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer, which through [[metastatic]] [[cancerous]] deposits in the spine, could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain, such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins 2002 p. 65&quot;/&gt; This explanation has been widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doran 1996 p. 44&quot;/&gt; Suicide has also often been considered an option, motives being Amy Dudley's depression or mortal illness.&lt;ref&gt;Gristwood 2007 pp. 115, 120–123; Doran 1996 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage hopes and proposals===
[[File:Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester 02229.jpg|thumb|Robert Dudley. An 18th century copy of his portrait and autograph]]
Elizabeth remained close to Dudley and he, with her blessing and on her prompting, pursued his suit for her hand in an atmosphere of diplomatic intrigue.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 1996 p. 45–52; Adams 2008b&lt;/ref&gt; His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would have none of that and everything remained as it was.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

In October 1562 the Queen fell ill with [[smallpox]] and, believing her life to be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley [[Lord Protector|Protector]] of the Realm and to give him a suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Mary at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir only on condition that she marry Robert Dudley.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 136, 160, 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of her marriage to Dudley,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 140, 146, 147&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1564 he was created [[Earl of Leicester]], a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; In January 1565 [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]], the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: &lt;blockquote&gt;But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 pp. 143–144, 152, 158, 168; Wilson 1981 p. 141; Jenkins 2002 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in the interest of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], Mary's eventual choice of husband.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin 1939 p. 152; Wilson 1981 p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2008b; Chamberlin 1939 pp. 155, 156–157, 159–161&lt;/ref&gt; Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser 1972 p. 267; Wilson 1981 p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1564 Dudley had realised that his chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 1996 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he could not &quot;consider ... without great repugnance&quot;, as he said, that she chose another husband.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1904 p. 90; Doran 1996 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1904 pp. 90–94, 99, 101–104; Jenkins 2002 p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doran 1996 p. 212&quot;&gt;Doran 1996 p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; To remove this threat to [[Habsburg]] and [[House of Valois|Valois]] suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1904 pp. 94, 95, 138, 197; Doran 1996 p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; These he had sabotaged and would continue to sabotage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doran pp. 212–213&quot;&gt;Doran 1996 pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life at court===
[[File:Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester drawing by Zuccaro 1575.jpg|thumb|Robert Dudley, dressed partly in [[Jousting|tilting armour]], 1575&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 1998 p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As &quot;a male favourite to a virgin queen&quot;, Robert Dudley found himself in an unprecedented situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; His apartments at court were next to hers,&lt;ref&gt;Gristwood 2007 p. 151; Girouard 1979 p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and—perceived as knowing &quot;the Queen and her nature best of any man&quot;—his influence was matched by few.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 140; Wilson 1981 p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth's possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; [[Sir Christopher Hatton]] reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away for a few weeks in 1578: &quot;This court wanteth your presence. Her majesty is unaccompanied and, I assure you, the chambers are almost empty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1981 p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

On ceremonial occasions Dudley often acted as an unofficial consort, sometimes in the Queen's stead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson p. 305&quot;&gt;Wilson 1981 p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; He largely assumed charge of court ceremonial and organised hundreds of small and large festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 120; Wilson 1981 pp. 78, 305&lt;/ref&gt; From 1587 he was [[Lord Steward]],&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2002 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; being responsible for the [[royal household]]'s supply with food and other commodities. He displayed a strong sense for economising and reform in this function, which he had ''de facto'' occupied long before his official appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes 1987 pp. 141–144; Wilson 1981 pp. 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; The sanitary situation in the palaces was a perennial problem, and a talk with Leicester about these issues inspired [[John Harington (writer)|John Harington]] to construct a [[water closet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams: At Home&quot;&gt;Adams 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Leicester was a lifelong sportsman, hunting and [[joust]]ing in the [[tiltyard]], and an indefatigable [[History of tennis|tennis-player]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams: At Home&quot;/&gt; He was also the Queen's regular dancing partner.&lt;ref&gt;Loades 2004 p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

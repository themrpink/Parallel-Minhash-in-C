===Reproduction===
Unlike most [[bony fish]], sharks are [[r/K selection theory|K-selected]] reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. [[Fecundity]] in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female's [[oviduct]]. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during [[mating]]. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mating&quot;/&gt;

====Asexual====
There have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes [[genetic diversity]], which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the [[blue shark]]'s decline off the [[Ireland|Irish]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Brooding===
Sharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, [[oviparity]], [[Viviparous|viviparity]] and [[ovoviviparity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&amp;-rays/birth-&amp;-care.htm |title=SHARKS &amp; RAYS, SeaWorld/Busch Gardens ANIMALS, BIRTH &amp; CARE OF YOUNG |publisher=Busch Entertainment Corporation |access-date=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803103514/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-%26-rays/birth-%26-care.htm |archive-date=2013-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.010|title=Sharks, rays and abortion: The prevalence of capture-induced parturition in elasmobranchs|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=217|pages=11–27|year=2018|last1=Adams|first1=Kye R|last2=Fetterplace|first2=Lachlan C|last3=Davis|first3=Andrew R|last4=Taylor|first4=Matthew D|last5=Knott|first5=Nathan A|url=http://marxiv.org/k2qvy/|access-date=2018-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223020619/https://marxiv.org/k2qvy/|archive-date=2019-02-23|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ovoviviparity====
Most sharks are [[ovoviviparous]], meaning that the eggs hatch in the [[oviduct]] within the mother's body and that the egg's [[yolk]] and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. [[Lamniforme]] sharks practice ''[[oophagy]]'', where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs.  Taking this a step further,  [[sand tiger shark]] pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos.  The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to [[offspring|brood]] the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The [[whale shark]] is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. [[Squalidae|Dogfish]] have the longest known [[gestation period]] of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. [[Basking shark]]s and [[frilled shark]]s appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth&quot;/&gt;

====Oviparity====
Some species are [[oviparous]], laying their fertilized eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]] with the consistency of [[leather]] protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. The egg case is commonly called a ''[[mermaid's purse]]''. Oviparous sharks include the [[horn shark]], [[catshark]], [[Port Jackson shark]], and [[swellshark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Viviparity====
Viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg, and results in live birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology of Sharks and Their Relatives: Second Edition|last1=Carrier|first1=J.C|last2=Musick|first2=J.A.|last3=Heithaus|first3=M.R.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Young are born fully formed and self-sufficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Hammerheads, the [[requiem sharks]] (such as the [[bull shark|bull]] and [[blue shark]]s), and [[smoothhound]]s are viviparous.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth&quot;/&gt;

Sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 [[scalloped hammerhead]]s congregate around [[seamount]]s and islands, e.g., in the [[Gulf of California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Cross-species social hierarchies exist.

===Sleep===
All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them&lt;ref name=&quot;Sleep&quot;/&gt; and as such they are not truly asleep.

Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the [[spiny dogfish]] that its [[spinal cord]], rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so [[spiny dogfish]] can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sleep&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Most sharks are [[carnivorous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feeding&quot;/&gt; [[Basking shark]]s, [[whale shark]]s, and [[megamouth shark]]s have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding [[plankton]]: basking sharks practice [[ram feeding]], whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make [[suction feeding]] more efficient by using the [[luminescent]] tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires [[gill raker]]s—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient [[sieve]]—analogous to the [[baleen]] plates of the [[great whale]]s. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feeding&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|Unlike many other sharks, the great white shark is not actually an [[apex predator]] in all of its natural environments, as it is sometimes hunted by [[Killer whale|orcas]]|thumb|right|alt=Photo of great white on surface with open jaws revealing meal.]]

Other highly specialized feeders include [[cookiecutter shark]]s, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and [[marine mammal]]s. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt;

Some seabed–dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators. [[Angel shark]]s and [[wobbegong]]s use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/orectolobiformes.htm|title=Order Orectolobiformes: Carpet Sharks—39 species|last=Martin|first=R.

Other sharks feed on [[squid]] or fish, which they swallow whole. The [[viper dogfish]] has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The [[great white shark|great white]] and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. [[Thresher shark]]s use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and [[sawshark]]s either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostra]].

Many sharks, including the [[whitetip reef shark]] are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey. These social sharks are often migratory, traveling huge distances around [[ocean basin]]s in large schools. These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range and habitat===
Sharks are found in all seas. They generally do not live in fresh water, with a few exceptions such as the [[bull shark]] and the [[river shark]] which can swim both in seawater and freshwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW (Bull sharks)&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2006 the [[International Shark Attack File]] (ISAF) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the [[great white shark|great white]], [[oceanic whitetip shark|oceanic whitetip]], [[tiger shark|tiger]], and [[bull shark]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;isaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]], and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' film series. ''Jaws'' author [[Peter Benchley]], as well as [[Jaws (film)|''Jaws'']] director [[Steven Spielberg]], later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0606_shark5.html|title=Jaws Author Peter Benchley Talks Sharks|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|date=7 June 2002|publisher=National Geographic Society|access-date=2009-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825091739/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0606_shark5.html|archive-date=25 August 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130704-shark-attack-prevention-response-ocean-beach-animal-science/ |title=How Should We Respond When Humans and Sharks Collide? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-07-04 |access-date=2013-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906062150/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130704-shark-attack-prevention-response-ocean-beach-animal-science/ |archive-date=2013-09-06 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically. Research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc 2018&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190808-why-do-sharks-attack-humans The real reasons why sharks attack humans], By Richard Gray, 8th August 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964569116302058 Global shark attack hotspots: Identifying underlying factors behind increased unprovoked shark bite incidence], by Blake K.Chapman Daryl McPhee.

===In captivity===
{{Main|Sharks in captivity}}
Until recently, only a few [[benthic]] species of shark, such as [[Horn shark|hornsharks]], [[leopard shark]]s and [[catshark]]s, had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large [[pelagic]] sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcss.sc/MCNEWS/mcn_v3_1_art3.htm |title=Whale Sharks in Captivity |access-date=2006-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902212049/http://www.mcss.sc/MCNEWS/mcn_v3_1_art3.htm |archive-date=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until September 2004, when the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.

===In culture===
====In Hawaii====
Sharks figure prominently in [[Hawaiian mythology]]. Stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. [[Hawaii]]an mythology also includes many shark [[god]]s. Among a fishing people, the most popular of all [[aumakua]], or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. [[Kamaku]] describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the [[kahuna]] can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, ''[[Jabberjaw]]'', and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a [[Walking the plank|plank]] above shark infested waters.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarinePolicy201212&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2012.12.034 | volume=40 | title=Global catches, exploitation rates, and rebuilding options for sharks | year=2013 | journal=Marine Policy | pages=194–204 | last1 = Worm | first1 = Boris | last2 = Davis | first2 = Brendal | last3 = Kettemer | first3 = Lisa | last4 = Ward-Paige | first4 = Christine A. | last5 = Chapman | first5 = Demian | last6 = Heithaus | first6 = Michael R. | last7 = Kessel | first7 = Steven T. | last8 = Gruber | first8 = Samuel H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eLife2014&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extinction risk and conservation of the world's sharks and rays |journal=eLife |volume=3 |pages=e00590 |author1=Nicholas K Dulvy |author2=Sarah L Fowler |author3=John A Musick |author4=Rachel D Cavanagh |author5=Peter M Kyne |author6=Lucy R Harrison |author7=John K Carlson |author8=Lindsay NK Davidson |author9=Sonja V Fordham |author10=Malcolm P Francis |author11=Caroline M Pollock |author12=Colin A Simpfendorfer |author13=George H Burgess |author14=Kent E Carpenter |author15=Leonard JV Compagno |author16=David A Ebert |author17=Claudine Gibson |author18=Michelle R Heupel |author19=Suzanne R Livingstone |author20=Jonnell C Sanciangco |author21=John D Stevens |author22=Sarah Valenti |author23=William T White |doi=10.7554/eLife.00590|pmid=24448405 |pmc=3897121 |year=2014|quote=eLife 2014;3:e00590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including [[Japan]] and [[Australia]]. In the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], shark is the most commonly used fish in [[fish and chips]], {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} in which fillets are battered and [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called [[Flake (fish)|flake]]. In [[India]], small sharks or baby sharks (called sora in [[Tamil language]], [[Telugu language]]) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not developed, cooking the flesh breaks it into powder, which is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal [[Tamil Nadu]]. [[Iceland]]ers ferment [[Greenland shark]]s to produce a delicacy called [[hákarl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herz2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204661604577186843056231170 |title=You eat that? |last=Herz |first=Rachel |date=28 January 2012 |work=Wall Street Journal |access-date=30 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317012217/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204661604577186843056231170 |archive-date=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.&lt;ref name=Bakalar_10_12_2006&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas |title=38 Million Sharks Killed for Fins Annually, Experts Estimate |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061012-shark-fin.html |date=October 12, 2006 |magazine=National Geographic |access-date=2012-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017121948/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061012-shark-fin.html |archive-date=October 17, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks are often killed for [[shark fin soup]]. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal back into the water.

'''''The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty''''' is a [[comic opera]] in two acts, with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[libretto]] by [[W. S. Gilbert|W.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Gilbert]]. The opera's official premiere was at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]] in New York City on 31 December 1879, where the show was well received by both audiences and critics.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Helga. [http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/pirates/pp2.html Information from the Savoyoperas.org website], Savoy Operas, 27 November 2000, accessed 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the [[Opera Comique]], where it ran for 363 performances.

The story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets the daughters of Major-General Stanley, including Mabel, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic soon learns, however, that he was born on the 29th of February, and so, technically, he has a birthday only once each [[leap year]].  His [[indenture]] specifies that he remain apprenticed to the pirates until his &quot;twenty-first birthday&quot;, meaning that he must serve for another 63 years.&lt;ref&gt;This figure assumes that Gilbert was ignoring the fact that there was no leap year in 1900. Otherwise, the action of the play would take place in 1873 instead of 1877, and the figure would be 67 years. See Bradley (1996), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Bound by his own sense of duty, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.

''Pirates'' was the fifth [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] collaboration and introduced the much-parodied &quot;[[Major-General's Song]]&quot;. The opera was performed for over a century by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] in Britain and by many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide. Modernized productions include [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, which ran for 787 performances, winning the [[Tony Award for Best Revival]] and the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical]], and spawning many imitations and a [[The Pirates of Penzance (1983 film)|1983 film adaptation]]. ''Pirates'' remains popular today, taking its place along with ''[[The Mikado]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

''The Pirates of Penzance'' was the only [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera to have its official premiere in the United States. At the time, American law offered no [[copyright]] protection to foreigners. After the pair's previous opera, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', achieved success in London in 1878, approximately 150 American companies quickly mounted unauthorised productions that often took considerable liberties with the text and paid no royalties to the creators.&lt;ref name=Prestige&gt;Prestige, Colin. &quot;D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates: The Original New York Productions of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot;, pp. 113–48 at p. 118, [http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/handle/1808/5875 Papers Presented at the International Conference of G&amp;S] held at the [[University of Kansas]], May 1970, edited by James Helyar.

''Gilbert and Sullivan at Law'', pp. 204–05, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press (1982), {{ISBN|0838631797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan hoped to forestall further &quot;copyright piracy&quot; by mounting the first production of their next opera in America, before others could copy it, and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardsamuels.com/illustratedstory/isc10.htm International copyright pirating] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028222322/http://www.edwardsamuels.com/illustratedstory/isc10.htm |date=28 October 2008 }}, Edward Samuels, accessed 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the first American production of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' by opening the production themselves on Broadway, prior to the London production, and they also operated profitable US touring companies of ''Pirates'' and ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=Prestige/&gt; However, Gilbert, Sullivan, and their producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], failed in their efforts, over the next decade, to control the American performance copyrights  to ''Pirates'' and their other operas.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Zvi S.

Fiction and plays about pirates were ubiquitous in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil, &quot;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2729/why-are-pirates-depicted-with-a-parrot-on-their-shoulder Why are pirates depicted with a parrot on their shoulder?

Sullivan had written a comic opera called ''[[The Contrabandista]]'', in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera ''[[Princess Toto]]'', the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s operetta ''[[Les brigands]]'', in 1871.&lt;ref name=Williams130/&gt; As in ''Les brigands'', ''The Pirates of Penzance'' absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and [[Club (weapon)#Types|life preserver]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genesis===
While ''Pinafore'' was running strongly at the [[Opera Comique]] in London, Gilbert was eager to get started on his and Sullivan's next opera, and he began working on the libretto in December 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He re-used several elements of his 1870 one-act piece, ''[[Our Island Home]]'', which had introduced a pirate &quot;chief&quot;, Captain Bang. Bang was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate band as a child by his deaf nursemaid. Also, Bang, like Frederic in ''The Pirates of Penzance'', had never seen a woman before and felt a keen sense of duty, as an apprenticed pirate, until the passage of his twenty-first birthday freed him from his articles of indenture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eaton Faning|Faning, Eaton]] and [[Shapcott Wensley]]. Extra Supplement: ''Our Island Home'' in ''Musical Times'', Vol. 55, No. 859 (1 September 1914), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] believed that Gilbert drew on ideas in ''[[Les brigands]]'' for his new libretto, including the businesslike bandits and the bumbling police.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (Vol. 1), p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan also inserted into Act II an idea they first considered for a one-act opera parody in 1876 about burglars meeting police, while their conflict escapes the notice of the oblivious father of a large family of girls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/08/01/80694429.pdf &quot;A Talk With Mr. Sullivan&quot;]{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The New York Times'', 1 August 1879, p. 3, accessed 22 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''Pinafore'', &quot;there was a wordful self-descriptive set-piece for Stanley [&quot;[[The Major-General's Song]]&quot;], introducing himself much as Sir Joseph Porter had done ... a lugubrious comic number for the Sergeant of Police ... a song of confession for Ruth, the successor [to] Little Buttercup&quot;, romantic material for Frederic and Mabel, and &quot;ensemble and chorus music in turn pretty, parodic and atmospheric.&quot;&lt;ref name=ORC&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of ''Pinafore'' and the new opera in America.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager [[John T. Ford]]&lt;ref&gt;Ford had been one of the few managers who had paid Gilbert and Sullivan any kind of fee for performing ''Pinafore'' in America, and his reward for a small gesture was great (Stedman, p. 169).&lt;/ref&gt; to present, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], the authorised productions.  He then returned to London.&lt;ref name=Ainger169&gt;Ainger, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, once ''Pinafore'' became a hit in London, the author, composer and producer had the financial resources to produce future shows themselves, and they executed a plan to free themselves from their financial backers in the &quot;Comedy Opera Company&quot;. Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally among themselves after the expenses of each of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan gave notice to the directors of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing their contract to produce ''Pinafore'' with them and that he would withdraw his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July.  This followed a closure of the Opera Comique for repairs that Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte used to give them an argument that the original run of the production had &quot;closed&quot;. See Stedman, pp. 170–72; Ainger, pp. 165–67 and 194–95; and Jacobs, p. 126. Sullivan wrote to a former producer, [[John Hollingshead]] of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], saying: &quot;You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the ''Merry Wives of Windsor'' ... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' also at once. I am detaining the parts of ''Pinafore'', so that the directors shall not take them away from the [[Opera Comique|Comique]] tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent ''you'' set.&quot; See Rees, p. 89. The Comedy Opera Company directors engaged another theatre to play a rival production of ''Pinafore'', but they had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to the Opera Comique to seize the scenery and props during the evening performance of ''Pinafore''. See Ainger, p. 170 and Jacobs, pp. 124–25. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. See Stedman, pp. 170–71 and Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;], ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009. See also &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Era'', 10 August 1879, p. 5 and &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Leeds Mercury'', 13 August 1879, p. 8. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte's favour about two years later. See Ainger, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1879, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sailed to America with a company of strong singers, to play both ''Pinafore'' and the new opera, including [[J. H. Ryley]] as Sir Joseph, [[Blanche Roosevelt]] as Josephine, [[Alice Barnett]] as Little Buttercup, [[Furneaux Cook]] as Dick Deadeye, [[Hugh Talbot]] as Ralph Rackstraw and [[Jessie Bond]] as Cousin Hebe, some of whom had been in the ''Pinafore'' cast in London.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129&gt;Jacobs, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; To these, he added some American singers, including [[Signor Brocolini]] as Captain Corcoran.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Cellier]] came to assist Sullivan, while his brother [[François Cellier|François]] remained in London to conduct ''Pinafore'' there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan chose talented actors who were not well-known stars, and so they did not command high fees. They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic [[Herman Klein]] wrote, &quot;we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings&amp;nbsp;.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Cox-Ife, William.

[[File:PiratesPenzance1879.gif|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the [[copyright performance]] at Paignton]]
The composition of the music for ''Pirates'' was unusual, in that Sullivan wrote the music for the acts in reverse, intending to bring the completed Act&amp;nbsp;II with him to New York, with Act I existing only in sketches. When he arrived in New York, however, he found that he had left the sketches behind, and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women's chorus, so they substituted the chorus &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; from their earlier opera, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's manuscript for ''Pirates'' contains pages removed from a ''Thespis'' score, with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four-part chorus. Some scholars (e.g. Tillett and Spencer, 2000) have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re-use &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain,&quot; and perhaps other parts of ''Thespis''. They argue that Sullivan's having brought the unpublished ''Thespis'' score to New York, when there were no plans to revive ''Thespis'', might not have been accidental.&lt;ref&gt;March, Jerry. &quot;Part of ''Thespis'' Score Discovered&quot;, ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XX, No. 1 (March 1981), p. 25; and Stedman, p. 95, n. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, on 10 December 1879, Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera, upon which he was hard at work in New York. &quot;I think it will be a great success, for it is exquisitely funny, and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the [[overture]] for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting its composition to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier.&lt;ref name=Ainger157/&gt;

''Pinafore'' opened in New York on 1 December 1879 and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, ''The Pirates of Penzance''.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; The work's title is a multi-layered joke. On the one hand, [[Penzance]] was a docile seaside resort in 1879, and not the place where one would expect to encounter pirates.&lt;ref&gt;From medieval times and in later centuries, however, Penzance was subject to frequent raiding by Turkish pirates, according to ''Canon Diggens Archive'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the title was also a jab at the theatrical &quot;pirates&quot; who had staged unlicensed productions of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in America.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Gary. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7877394/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html &quot;Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name&quot;]. ''The Telegraph'', 7 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; To secure the British [[copyright]],&lt;ref&gt;Performances had to be given in Britain before publication in order to secure copyright.  See Stephens, John Russell. ''The Profession of the Playwright: British Theatre 1800–1900'', Cambridge University Press (1992), pp. 104–15&lt;/ref&gt; a D'Oyly Carte touring company gave a perfunctory [[copyright performance]] of ''Pirates'' the afternoon before the New York premiere, at the Royal Bijou Theatre in [[Paignton]], Devon, organised by [[Helen Lenoir]], who would later marry Richard D'Oyly Carte. The cast, which was performing ''Pinafore'' in the evenings in [[Torquay]], received some of the music for ''Pirates'' only two days beforehand. Having had only one rehearsal, they travelled to nearby Paignton for the matinee, where they read their parts from scripts carried onto the stage, making do with whatever costumes they had on hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pirates'' opened on 31 December 1879 in New York and was an immediate hit.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; On 2 January 1880, Sullivan wrote, in another letter to his mother from New York, &quot;The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully funny in parts, and sometimes brilliant in dialogue – beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does. ... The music is infinitely superior in every way to the ''Pinafore'' – 'tunier' and more developed, of a higher class altogether. I think that in time it will be very popular.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing ''Pirates'' and ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stedman175&gt;Stedman, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's prediction was correct. After a strong run in New York and several American tours, ''Pirates'' opened in London on 3 April 1880, running for 363 performances there.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; It remains one of the most popular G&amp;S works.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Tim.

The biographer Michael Ainger, however, doubts that Gilbert intended a caricature of Wolseley, identifying instead General Henry Turner, uncle of Gilbert's wife, as the pattern for the &quot;modern Major-General&quot;. Gilbert disliked Turner, who, unlike the progressive Wolseley, was of the old school of officers. Nevertheless, in the original London production, [[George Grossmith]] imitated Wolseley's mannerisms and appearance, particularly his large moustache, and the audience recognised the allusion.

;Act I
On the coast of [[Cornwall]], during [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign, Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty-first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates (&quot;Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry&quot;). The pirates' maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic's nursemaid long ago, she made a mistake &quot;through being hard of hearing&quot;: Mishearing Frederic's father's instructions, she apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship's ''[[Maritime pilot|pilot]]'' (&quot;When Frederic was a little lad&quot;).

Frederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth, and he believes her to be beautiful. The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation. Frederic announces that, although it pains him, so strong is his sense of duty that, once free from his apprenticeship, he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates' extermination. He also points out that they are not successful pirates: since they are all orphans, they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans. Frederic notes that word of this has got about, so captured ships' companies routinely claim to be orphans. Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him, so that he need not destroy them, but the Pirate King says that, contrasted with respectability, piracy is comparatively honest (&quot;Oh! better far to live and die&quot;). The pirates depart, leaving Frederic and Ruth. Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair, and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance (&quot;Oh false one! You have deceived me!&quot;). Sending Ruth away, Frederic hides before the girls arrive.

[[File:Power as Frederic.jpg|thumb|[[Sir George Power, 7th Baronet|George Power]], the original Frederic in London|right|upright]]
The girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot (&quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;). Frederic reveals himself (&quot;Stop, ladies, pray!&quot;), startling them. He appeals to them to help him reform (&quot;Oh! is there not one maiden breast?&quot;). The girls are fascinated by him, but all reject him, except one: Mabel responds to his plea, chiding her sisters for their lack of charity (&quot;Oh sisters deaf to pity's name for shame!&quot;). She offers Frederic her pity (&quot;Poor wand'ring one&quot;), and the two quickly fall in love. The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone (&quot;What ought we to do?&quot;), deciding to &quot;talk about the weather,&quot; although they steal glances at the affectionate couple (&quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot;).

Frederic warns the young ladies that his old associates will soon return (&quot;Stay, we must not lose our senses&quot;), but before they can flee, the pirates arrive and capture the girls, intending to marry them (&quot;Here's a first rate opportunity&quot;). Mabel warns the pirates that the girls' father is a Major-General (&quot;Hold, monsters!&quot;), who soon arrives and introduces himself (&quot;[[Major-General's Song|I am the very model of a modern Major-General]]&quot;). He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters, leaving him to face his old age alone. Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy (&quot;Oh, men of dark and dismal fate&quot;). The soft-hearted pirates release the girls (&quot;Hail, Poetry!&quot;), making Major-General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band (&quot;Pray observe the magnanimity&quot;).

;Act II
The Major-General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate, surrounded by his daughters. His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him (&quot;Oh dry the glist'ning tear&quot;). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates (&quot;When the foeman bares his steel&quot;). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter by fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this and leave reluctantly.

[[File:1919paradox.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&quot;Have mercy on us!&quot;]]
Left alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (&quot;Now for the pirate's lair&quot;), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic's apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first ''birthday'' – and, because that birthday happens to be on the 29th of February (in a [[leap year]]), it means that [[Quibble (plot device)|technically]] only five birthdays have passed (&quot;When you had left our pirate fold&quot;), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates.  He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates' &quot;revenge will be swift and terrible&quot; (&quot;Away, away, my heart's on fire&quot;).

Frederic meets Mabel (&quot;All is prepared&quot;), and she pleads with him to stay (&quot;Stay Frederic, stay&quot;), but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday – in 1940. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel &quot;It seems so long&quot; (&quot;Oh here is love and here is truth&quot;); Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself (&quot;No, I'll be brave&quot;) and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. They muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of &quot;that liberty which is so dear to all&quot; (&quot;When a felon's not engaged in his employment&quot;). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates (&quot;A rollicking band of pirates we&quot;), who have stolen onto the estate, intending to avenge themselves for the Major-General's lie (&quot;With cat-like tread&quot;).

Just then, Major-General Stanley appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide (&quot;Hush, hush! not a word&quot;), while the Major-General listens to the soothing breeze (&quot;Sighing softly to the river&quot;). The girls come looking for him (&quot;Now what is this and what is that&quot;). The pirates leap to the attack, and the police rush to their defence; but the police are easily defeated, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The Sergeant has one stratagem left: he demands that the pirates yield &quot;in Queen Victoria's name&quot;; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are &quot;all noblemen who have gone wrong&quot;. The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble pirates after all.

==Critical reception==
The notices from critics were generally excellent in both New York and London in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;The London theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' even gave the ''ad hoc'' performance in Paignton a good review: see &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan's New Opera&quot;, ''The Era'', 4 January 1880, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the ''[[New York Herald|Herald]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune|Tribune]]'' both dedicated considerable space to their reviews. The ''Herald'' took the view that &quot;the new work is in every respect superior to the ''Pinafore'', the text more humorous, the music more elegant and more elaborate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, ''The Daily News'', 15 January 1880, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tribune'' called it &quot;a brilliant and complete success&quot;, commenting, &quot;The humor of the ''Pirates'' is richer, but more recondite. It demands a closer attention to the words [but] there are great stores of wit and drollery ... which will well repay exploration. ... The music is fresh, bright, elegant and merry, and much of it belongs to a higher order of art than the most popular of the tunes of ''Pinafore''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1880-01-01/ed-1/seq-5/ &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;]. ''New York Tribune'', 1 January 1880, accessed 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' also praised the work, writing, &quot;it would be impossible for a confirmed misanthrope to refrain from merriment over it&quot;, though the paper doubted if ''Pirates'' could repeat the prodigious success of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=NYTrev/&gt;

After the London premiere, the critical consensus, led by the theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', was that the new work marked a distinct advance on Gilbert and Sullivan's earlier works.&lt;ref name=Comiquerev/&gt; ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' said, &quot;Of Mr. Sullivan's music we must speak in detail on some other occasion. Suffice it for the present to say that in the new style which he has marked out for himself it is the best he has written.&quot;&lt;ref name=pmg&gt;&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, ''The Pall Mall Gazette'', 6 April 1880, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Graphic]]'' wrote:
{{quote|That no composer can meet the requirements of Mr. Gilbert like Mr. Sullivan, and ''vice versa'', is a fact universally admitted. One might fancy that verse and music were of simultaneous growth, so closely and firmly are they interwoven. Away from this consideration, the score of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' is one upon which Mr. Sullivan must have bestowed earnest consideration, for independently of its constant flow of melody, it is written throughout for voices and instruments with infinite care, and the issue is a cabinet miniature of exquisitely defined proportions. … That ''the Pirates'' is a clear advance upon its precursors, from ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' to ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', cannot be denied; it contains more variety, marked character, careful workmanship, and is in fact a more finished artistic achievement … a brilliant success.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Music&quot;, ''The Graphic'', 10 April 1880, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

There were a few dissenting comments: ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought both author and composer had drawn on the works of their predecessors: &quot;Mr. Gilbert ... seems to have borrowed an idea from [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Critic (play)|The Critic]]''; Mr. Sullivan's music is sprightly, tuneful and full of 'go', although it is certainly lacking in originality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;From Our London Correspondent&quot;, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 5 April 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' noted, &quot;It doesn't appear to have struck any of the critics yet that the central idea in ''The Pirates of Penzance'' is taken from ''Our Island Home'', which was played by the [[German Reed Entertainment|German Reeds]] some ten years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting Times'', 10 April 1880, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' thought Gilbert's wit outran his dramatic invention, and Sullivan's music for the new work was not quite as good as his score for ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', which the ''Times'' critic called a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 April 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical analysis==
The overture to ''The Pirates of Penzance'' was composed by Sullivan and his musical assistant [[Alfred Cellier]]. It follows the pattern of most [[Savoy opera]] overtures: a lively opening (the melody of &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;), a slow middle section (&quot;Ah, leave me not to pine alone&quot;), and a concluding [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|allegro]] in a compressed [[sonata form]], in which the themes of &quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot; and &quot;A paradox, a paradox&quot; are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody===
The score parodies several composers, most conspicuously [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]. &quot;Come, friends, who plough the sea&quot; and &quot;You triumph now&quot; are burlesques of ''[[Il trovatore]]'',&lt;ref name=hulme&gt;Hulme, David Russell. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O005334 &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;]. ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera'', Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 30 June 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the best-known choral passages from the finale to Act&amp;nbsp;I, &quot;Hail Poetry&quot;, is, according to the Sullivan scholar, [[Arthur Jacobs]], a burlesque of the prayer scene, &quot;La Vergine degli Angeli&quot;, in Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; However, another musicologist, Nicholas Temperley, writes, &quot;The choral outburst 'Hail, Poetry' in ''The Pirates of Penzance'' would need very little alteration to turn it into a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] string quartet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Temperley, Nicholas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/732768 &quot;Mozart's Influence on English Music&quot;]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', vol. 42, issue 4, October 1961, pp. 307–18, Oxford University Press, accessed 1 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known parody number from the work is the song for [[coloratura]], &quot;Poor wand'ring one&quot;, which is generally thought to burlesque [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s waltz-songs,&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; though the music critic of ''The Times'' called it &quot;mock-[[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Guthrie's Irreverent Pirates&quot;, ''The Times'', 16 February 1962, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I'VE SEEN IT COMPARED WITH &quot;SEMPRE LIBERA&quot;. IS THERE ANY MENTION OF THAT? --&gt; In a scene in Act&amp;nbsp;II, Mabel addresses the police, who chant their response in the manner of an [[Anglican]] church service.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. [https://archive.today/20120912003426/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/review-23440103-these-pirates-have-real-swagger.do &quot;These pirates have real swagger&quot;]. ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 20 February 2008, accessed 2 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan even managed to parody two composers at once. The critic [[Rodney Milnes]] describes the Major-General's Act&amp;nbsp;II song, &quot;Sighing softly to the river&quot;, &quot;as plainly inspired by – and indeed worthy of – Sullivan's hero [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=rodders&gt;&quot;Putting the Jolly in Roger&quot;, ''The Times'', 26 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amanda Holden (writer)|Amanda Holden]] speaks of the song's &quot;Schubertian water-rippling accompaniment&quot;, but adds that it simultaneously spoofs Verdi's ''Il trovatore'', with the soloist unaware of a concealed male chorus singing behind him.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patter, counterpoint, and vocal writing===
{{listen|type=music|filename=Major-General's Song.ogg|title=Major-General's Song|description=[[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]] sings the ''Major-General's Song'' with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]] (1929)}}
Writing about [[patter song]]s, Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised &quot;the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in The Pirates or the Colonel in [[Patience (opera)|Patience]].&quot;&lt;!--SPELLING AND LACK OF ITALICS ARE AS GBS WROTE THEM. GBS WAS A FERVENT ADVOCATE OF SPELLING REFORM AND HIS OWN WRITING REFLECTED THAT. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (Vol. 2) p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

This opera contains two well-known examples of Sullivan's characteristic combination of two seemingly disparate melodies. Jacobs suggests that [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[La damnation de Faust]]'', a great favourite in Sullivan's formative years, may have been the model for Sullivan's trademark contrapuntal mingling of the rapid prattle of the women's chorus in Act I (&quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot;) in 2/4 time with the lovers' duet in waltz time. Jacobs writes that &quot;the whole number [shifts] with Schubertian ease from B to G and back again.&quot;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27100 &quot;Sullivan, Sir Arthur.&quot;] Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 30 June 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Act II, a double chorus combines the policemen's dogged tune, &quot;When the foeman bares his steel&quot; and the soaring line for the women, &quot;Go, ye heroes, go to glory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In adapting the four-part chorus &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; from ''Thespis'' for re-use in ''Pirates'', Sullivan took less trouble: he wrote only a single vocal line, suitable for soprano voices.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the number ends with another example of Sullivan's counterpoint, with the chorus singing the second melody of the piece (&quot;Let us gaily tread the measure&quot;) while the orchestra plays the first (&quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rees, pp. 62–63 suggested that in the original ''Thespis'' version, for male as well as female voices, the men would have sung the first theme while the women sang the second.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan set a particular vocal challenge for the soprano who portrays Mabel. The Sullivan scholar [[Gervase Hughes]] wrote, &quot;Mabel ... ''must'' be a coloratura because of 'Poor wand'ring one!', yet 'Dear father, why leave your bed' demands steady beauty of tone throughout the octave F to F, and 'Ah, leave me not to pine' goes a third lower still.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Music of Arthur Sullivan'' (1959), Hughes quoted four extracts from ''Pirates'', saying that if hearing each out of context one might attribute it to Schubert, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], Gounod or [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]] respectively, &quot;yet on learning the truth one would kick oneself for not having recognised Sullivan's touch in all four.&quot; Hughes concluded by quoting the introductory bars of &quot;When a felon's not engaged in his employment&quot;, adding, &quot;There could never be any doubt as to who wrote ''that'', and it is as English as our wonderful police themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
[[File:pirates of penzance restoration.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1880 poster]]
Because the work was premiered in three different places (the Paignton performance and the full productions in New York and London), there are more variations in the early libretto and score of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' than in other Gilbert and Sullivan works. Songs sent from New York to the D'Oyly Carte touring company in England for the Paignton premiere were then altered or omitted during Broadway rehearsals. Gilbert and Sullivan trimmed the work for the London premiere, and Gilbert made further alterations up to and including the 1908 Savoy revival. For example, early versions depicted the Pirate King as the servant of the pirate band,&lt;ref name=brad&gt;Bradley (1982) pp. 90–159&lt;/ref&gt; and the words of the opening chorus were, &quot;Pour, O King, the pirate sherry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson W. R., Changes in the &quot;Pirates&quot;. ''Gramophone'', June 1950, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In the original New York production the revelation by Ruth that the pirates are &quot;all noblemen who have gone wrong&quot; prompted the following exchange (recalling a famous passage in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''):
{|
|-
|GENERAL, POLICE &amp; GIRLS:||What, all noblemen?
|-
|KING &amp; PIRATES:||Yes, ''all'' noblemen!
|-
|GENERAL, POLICE &amp; GIRLS:||What, all?
|-
|KING:||Well, nearly all!
|}
{|
|-
|valign=top|ALL:
| . . . They are nearly all noblemen who have gone wrong.
:Then give three cheers, both loud and strong,
:For the twenty noblemen who have gone wrong....
|}

In the original London production, this exchange was shortened to the following:
{|
|-
|GIRLS:||Oh spare them! They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.
|-
|GENERAL:||What, all noblemen?
|-
|KING:||Yes, ''all'' noblemen!
|-
|GENERAL:||What, all?
|-
|KING:||Well, nearly all!
|}

Gilbert deleted the exchange in the 1900 revival, and the [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Chappell]] vocal score was revised accordingly. For the 1908 revival Gilbert had the pirates yielding &quot;in good King Edward's name&quot;.&lt;ref name=brad/&gt; Despite [[Helen Carte]]'s repeated urging, Gilbert did not prepare an authorised version of the libretti of the [[Savoy operas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1989 production, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] restored one of the original versions of the finale, which finishes with a variation of &quot;I am the very model of a modern major-general&quot;, rather than with the customary reprise of &quot;Poor wand'ring one&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley (1982), pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; but in later revivals, it reverted to the more familiar text.&lt;ref name=rodders/&gt;

==Production history==
[[File:SulksPir.jpg|right|thumb|200px|1881 programme cover]]
''The Pirates of Penzance'' has been one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. After its unique triple opening in 1879–80, it was revived in London at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1888 and in 1900, and for the Savoy's repertory season of 1908–09. In the British provinces, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured it almost continuously from 1880–1884, and again in 1888. It re-entered the D'Oyly Carte touring repertory in 1893 and was never again absent until the company's closure in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 11, 18, 22, 35 ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt; New costumes were designed by [[Percy Anderson]] in 1919 and [[George Sheringham]] in 1929 (who also executed a new Act I set). [[Peter Goffin]] created a new touring set in 1957.&lt;ref name=rwApp/&gt;

In America, after the New York opening on New Year's Eve, 1879, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] launched four companies that covered the United States on tours that lasted through the following summer.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1982), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan themselves trained each of the touring companies through January and early February 1880, and each company's first performance – whether it was in Philadelphia, Newark, or Buffalo – was conducted by the composer. In Australia, its first authorised performance was on 19 March 1881 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by [[J. C. Williamson]].&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt; There was still no international copyright law in 1880, and the first ''unauthorised'' New York production was given by the [[Boston Ideal Opera Company]] at Booth's Theatre in September of that year.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The opera premiered in a German translation by [[Richard Genée]] and [[Camillo Walzel]] (''Die Piraten'') in Austria at the [[Theater an der Wien]] on 1 March 1889, and in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany, on 1 December 1936.&lt;ref name=ORC/&gt;

The first non-D'Oyly Carte professional production in a country that had been subject to Gilbert's copyright (other than Williamsons' authorised productions) was in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada, in September 1961. In 1979, the [[Torbay]] branch of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society presented a centenary tribute to the world premiere performance of ''Pirates'' in Paignton, with a production at the Palace Avenue Theatre (situated a few metres from the former Bijou Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivantorbay.co.uk/pirates79.htm &quot;''The Pirates of Penzance''&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042333/http://www.gilbertandsullivantorbay.co.uk/pirates79.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society (Torbay Branch), accessed 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

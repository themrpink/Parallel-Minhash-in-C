==Etymology==
The official name of the county, as specified in the county's charter, is &quot;Prince George’s County, Maryland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://lis.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Data/Charter/0103.DOC |chapter=Subtitle 1: General Provisions |work=Title 17, the Public Local Laws of Prince George's County, Part II |title=103: Name and Boundaries |accessdate=March 30, 2015 |date=April 3, 2000 |location=Prince George's County, Maryland |author=Prince George's County |publisher=Prince George's County |quote=Section 103.

The county's [[demonym]] is Prince Georgian, and its [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:semper eadem|Semper Eadem]]'' ({{lang-en|&quot;Ever the Same&quot;}}), a phrase used by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Prince George's County is frequently referred to as &quot;PG&quot; or &quot;PG County&quot;, an abbreviation which is the subject of debate, some residents viewing it as a pejorative and others holding neutral feelings toward the term or even preferring the abbreviation over the full name.&lt;ref name=WaPo2006/&gt;

In the mid to late [[Holocene]] era, the area was occupied by Paleo-Native Americans and then later, Native Americans. When the first European settlers arrived, what is now Prince George's County was inhabited by people of the [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway Indian Nation]]. Three branches of the tribe are still living today, two of which are headquartered in Prince George's County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-piscataway-history-20120116-story.html |title=Md. recognition of Piscataways adds happy note to complicated history |last=Walker |first=Childs |date=January 16, 2012 |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=November 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
Prince George's County was created by the English [[Council of Maryland]] in the [[Province of Maryland]] in April 1696&lt;ref name=msa23 /&gt; from portions of [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]] and [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] counties. The county was divided into six districts referred to as &quot;Hundreds&quot;: [[Mattapony|Mattapany]], [[Patuxent, Maryland|Petuxant]], [[Collington, Maryland|Collington]], Mount Calvert, [[Piscataway, Maryland|Piscattoway]] and New Scotland.&lt;ref name=msa23&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
A portion was detached in 1748 to form [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]]. Because Frederick County was subsequently divided to form the present [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]], [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington]] counties, all of these counties in addition were derived from what had up to 1748 been Prince George's County.

In 1791, portions of Prince George's County were ceded to form the new [[District of Columbia]] (along with portions of [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and parts of [[Northern Virginia]] that were later [[Retrocession (District of Columbia)|returned to Virginia]]).

===19th century===
During the [[War of 1812]], the British marched through the county by way of [[Battle of Bladensburg|Bladensburg]] to burn the White House. On their return, they kidnapped a prominent doctor, [[William Beanes]]. Lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] was asked to negotiate for his release, which resulted in his writing &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;.

Since much of the southern part of the county was tobacco farms that were worked by enslaved Africans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fight to Freedom: Slavery and the Underground Railroad in Maryland from the Maryland State Archives | url=http://www.mdslavery.net/html/antebellum/pg.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820075152/http://www.mdslavery.net/html/antebellum/pg.html |archive-date=August 20, 2004 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a high population of [[African Americans]] in the region. After the Civil War, many African Americans attempted to become part of Maryland politics, but were met with violent repression after the fall of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Records &amp; Recollections&amp;nbsp;– Early Black History in Prince George's County, Maryland by Bianca P.

In April 1865, [[John Wilkes Booth]] made his escape through Prince George's County while en route to [[Virginia]] after shooting President [[Abraham Lincoln]].

===20th century===
The proportion of African Americans declined during the first half of the 20th century, but was renewed to over 50% in the early 1990s when the county again became majority African American.&lt;ref&gt;PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HITTING 300

On July 1, 1997, the Prince George's County section of the city of [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], which straddled the boundary between Prince George's and Montgomery counties, was transferred to [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Substantial Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970–Present |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |publisher=Census Bureau |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506234535/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ctychng.html |archive-date= May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done after city residents voted to be under the sole jurisdiction of Montgomery County, and subsequent approval by both counties and the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. This was the first change in Prince George's County's boundaries since 1968, when the City of Laurel was unified in Prince George's County.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|499|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|483|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|16|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171515/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_24.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=September 12, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George's County lies in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], and its landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills and valleys. Along its western border with Montgomery County, [[Adelphi, Maryland|Adelphi]], [[Calverton, Maryland|Calverton]] and [[West Laurel, Maryland|West Laurel]] rise into the [[Piedmont (United States)|piedmont]], exceeding {{convert|300|ft}} in elevation.

The [[Patuxent River]] forms the county's eastern border with [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel]], [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]] and [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert]] counties.

County terrain, culture and demographics differ significantly by location within the county.

These regions are not formally defined, however, and the terms used to describe each area can vary greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ggwash.org/view/67562/what-do-you-call-different-regions-of-prince-georges-county |title=What do you call different regions of Prince George's County? Even for locals, it's complicated. |first=D.W. |last=Rowlands |date=May 8, 2018 |work=Greater Greater Washington |accessdate=June 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest terms, the county is generally divided into North County and South County with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] serving as the dividing line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ggwash.org/view/67614/here-are-our-readers-names-for-regions-of-prince-georges-county |title=We asked, you answered: here are our readers' names for regions of Prince George's County |first=D.W. |last=Rowlands |date=May 25, 2018 |work=Greater Greater Washington |accessdate=June 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North County====
Northern Prince George's County includes [[Laurel, Maryland|Laurel]], [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]], [[Adelphi, Maryland|Adelphi]], [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] and [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]]. This area of the county is anchored by the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] and the [[Baltimore–Washington Parkway]]. Laurel is experiencing a population boom with the construction of the [[Maryland Route 200|Inter-County Connector]]. The key employers in this region are the [[University of Maryland]], [[Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center|Beltsville Agricultural Research Center]], and [[Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center]]. Areas of geographic distinction include [[Greenbelt Park]], a wooded reserve adjacent to the planned environmental community of Greenbelt, and [[University Park, Maryland|University Park]], a collection of historic homes adjacent to the University of Maryland. [[Riversdale (Riverdale Park, Maryland)|Riversdale Mansion]], along with the historic homes of [[Berwyn Heights, Maryland|Berwyn Heights]], [[Mt. Rainier, Maryland|Mt. Rainier]] and [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]], along with [[Langley Park, Maryland|Langley Park]] are also located in this area. The hidden [[Lake Artemesia]], a park constructed during the completion of the [[Washington Metro]] [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green Line]], incorporates a stocked fishing lake and serves as the trail-head for an extensive [[Anacostia Tributary Trails]] system that runs along the [[Anacostia River]] and its tributaries. The south and central tracts of the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]] also lie in this part of the county; the north tract lies north of the [[Patuxent River]] in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]].

====Central County====
Central County, located on the eastern outskirts of the Capital Beltway, consists of [[Mitchellville, Maryland|Mitchellville]], [[Woodmore, Maryland|Woodmore]], [[Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Greater Upper Marlboro]], [[Springdale, Maryland|Springdale]], [[Largo, Maryland|Largo]], and [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]]. According to the 2010 census, it has generally been the fastest growing region of the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloch|first=Matthew|last2=Carter|first2=Shan|last3=McLean|first3=Alan|title=Mapping the 2010 U.S. Census|url=http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=thab1%3DV|work=New York Times|accessdate=November 2, 2011|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchellville is named for a wealthy African American family, the Mitchells, who owned a large portion of land in this area of the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Dwyer |last=Michael F. |title=Maryland Historic Trust Inventory Form For State Historic Sites Survey PG:71B-8 |year=1974 |pages=3 |place=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |publisher=Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission |url=http://www.mdihp.net/cfm/dsp_unitlist.cfm?county=pg&amp;letter=M }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryland Route 214|Central Avenue]], a major exit off the I-95 beltway, running east to west, is one of two main roads in this portion of the county. The other major roadway is [[Maryland Route 301|Old Crain Highway]], which runs north to south along the eastern portion of the county. The [[Newton White Mansion]] on the grounds is a popular site for weddings and political events.

[[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]] is best known as a planned [[Levittown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Baltz |first = Shirley Vlasak |title = A Chronicle of Belair |publisher =Bowie Heritage Committee |year = 1984 |location =Bowie, Maryland |pages = 84–88 |lccn = 85165028}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Levitt]] built traditional homes, as well as California contemporaries along [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]], the key highway to the eastern shore and the state capital of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. Bowie has currently grown to be the largest city in Prince George's County, with more than 50,000 people. It also has a large Caucasian population, compared to much of the county (48% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&amp;geo_id=16000US2408775&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7c04000US24%7c16000US2408775&amp;_street=&amp;_county=bowie&amp;_cityTown=bowie&amp;_state=04000US24&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=160&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null:null&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry= |title=Bowie city, Maryland&amp;nbsp;– Fact Sheet&amp;nbsp;– American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200210224014/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&amp;geo_id=16000US2408775&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US24%7C16000US2408775&amp;_street=&amp;_county=bowie&amp;_cityTown=bowie&amp;_state=04000US24&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=160&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null:null&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry= |archive-date=February 10, 2020 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing styles vary from the most contemporary to century old homes in Bowie's antique district (formerly known as Huntingtown), where the town of Bowie began as a haven for thoroughbred horse racing. Areas of geographic distinction include the [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Oden Bowie Mansion]], Allen Pond, key segments of the [[Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail]], as well as planned parks, lakes and walking trails.

====Rural Tier====
Prince George's rural tier was designated &quot;in the 2002 General Plan as an area where residential growth would be minimal&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planning.maryland.gov/pdf/ourwork/septicsbill/info/prin_info.pdf |title=Submittal to the Maryland Department of Planning Regarding Conformance with SB 236 |page=7 |publisher=Prince George's County, Maryland |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be found in the area well beyond the Beltway to the east and south of central county, bounded on the north by U.S. Route 50, the west by the communities [[Accokeek, Maryland|Accokeek]] and [[Fort Washington, Maryland|Fort Washington]], and the east by the [[Patuxent River]]. Prince George's origins are in this part of the county.  Most of this area contains the unincorporated parishes, villages and lost towns of Prince George's County. Largely under postal designations of &quot;[[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]]&quot; or &quot;[[Brandywine, Maryland|Brandywine]]&quot;, in truth the town of Upper Marlboro is more central county in character, though it is the post office location for various rural settlements. (The names of these unincorporated areas are listed below in the towns section of this article). Since 1721 Upper Marlboro has been the county seat of government, with families that trace their lineage back to Prince George's initial land grants and earliest governing officials. Names like Clagett, [[Sasscer]], King James and Queen Anne pepper the streets.

The rural tier has been the focus of orchestrated efforts by residents and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince George's County Planning |url=http://smartergrowth.net/anx/index.cfm/1,231,0,0,html/Supportive-Plans-amp-Zoning |work=Coalition for Smart Growth |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151438/http://smartergrowth.net/anx/index.cfm/1%2C231%2C0%2C0%2Chtml/Supportive-Plans-amp-Zoning |archive-date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2013}} Under the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission|Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC)]], [[Patuxent River Park]] is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in [[Queen Anne, Maryland|Queen Anne]] both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and [[Rosaryville State Park]], both popular among hikers and mountain bikers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

====Inner Beltway====
The inner beltway communities of [[Capitol Heights, Maryland|Capitol Heights]], [[District Heights, Maryland|District Heights]], [[Forestville, Maryland|Forestville]], [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], and [[Seat Pleasant, Maryland|Seat Pleasant]] border the neighboring District of Columbia's northeastern and southeastern quadrants. A high percentage of its residents are African-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downs|first=Kat|last2=Keating|first2=Dan|last3=Vaughn Kelso|first3=Nathaniel|title=Segregation Receding|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/census/2010/?custommap=0,4,2,0,38.89511,-77.0363,11,0|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South County====
South county is a blend of the greenery of the rural tier and the new development of central county. The communities of [[Clinton, Maryland|Clinton]], [[Oxon Hill, Maryland|Oxon Hill]], [[Temple Hills, Maryland|Temple Hills]] and [[Fort Washington, Maryland|Fort Washington]] are the largest areas of south county. It is the only portion of Prince George's County to enjoy the Potomac River waterfront, and that geographic distinction has yielded the rise of the [[National Harbor, Maryland|National Harbor]] project: a town center and riverside shopping and living development on the Potomac. The National Harbor, and it's associated entertainment ([[MGM Resort and Casino]]) and shopping ([[Tanger Outlets]]) districts, have become a major tourist and convention attraction, with significant hotel accommodations, eateries and shopping. Together, these projects were built on land formerly occupied by the infamous &quot;Salubria&quot; plantation, where a 14-years-old slave girl poisoned her master and his family in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_8591.shtml |title=Plantation where 14-year-old slave was hung to become outlet mall |first=Askia |last=Muhammad |date=February 3, 2012 |publisher=TheFinalCall |accessdate=November 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Water taxi]] service connects National Harbor to other destinations along the Potomac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wtop.com/business-finance/2018/03/wharf-water-taxi-service-national-harbor-starts-march-1/ |title=The Wharf water taxi service to National Harbor starts |first=Jeff |last=Calbaugh |date=March 1, 2018 |publisher=WTOP |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historic sites, including Jones Point Lighthouse, can be viewed from the harbor front.  Piscataway Park in Accokeek preserves many acres of woodland and wetlands along the Potomac River opposite Mount Vernon, Virginia. River Road in Fort Washington also yields great views of the Potomac. [[Fort Washington Park]] was a major battery and gives access to the public for tours of the fort, scenic access to the river and other picnic grounds. [[Oxon Hill Manor]] offers a working farm and plantation mansion for touring; [[His Lordship's Kindness]] is another major historic home. Also, [[Fort Foote]] is an old [[American Civil War]] fort and tourist destination.

==Politics and government==
Since 1792, the county seat has been [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]]. Prior to 1792, the county seat was located at Mount Calvert, a 76-acre (308,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) estate along the [[Patuxent River]] on the edge of what is now in the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Croom, Maryland|Croom]]. Since 1991, the county has slowly moved government functions from rural Upper Marlboro to the Largo area, closer to the center of population, while proposals to move the actual county seat remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/baker-wants-to-move-government-headquarters-to-largo-lawmakers-say/2015/07/22/3f5fa562-271e-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593_story.html|title=Baker wants to move government headquarters to Largo, lawmakers say|first=Arelis R.|last=Hernández|date=July 22, 2015|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George's County was granted a [[Government of Maryland#Charter counties|charter form of government]] in 1970 with the county executive elected as the head of the executive branch and the county council members as the leadership of the legislative branch. The county is divided into nine councilmanic districts, whose number designations wind roughly from north to south.&lt;ref name=dists&gt;{{cite web |url= https://pgccouncil.us/443/Councilmanic-Districts |title=Councilmanic Districts |publisher=Prince Georg's Countu Council |access-date=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two at-large council seats were added in 2018.&lt;ref name=ce18al&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Prince-Georges-County-Council-At-Large-County-Executive-Election-2018-499571321.html |title=Prince George's Elects Dems to At-Large Council; Alsobrooks Elected County Exec |publisher=[[WRC-TV|NBC4 Washington]] |date=November 6, 2018 |first=Gina |last=Cook |access-date=November 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165931/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Prince-Georges-County-Council-At-Large-County-Executive-Election-2018-499571321.html |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince George's County is part of the [[circuit court|Seventh Judicial Circuit]] of the state of Maryland and holds 23 of the 32 total circuit court judges in the circuit (which includes Calvert, Charles, Prince George's, and St. Mary's counties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/31cc/html/ccf.html |title=Maryland Circuit Courts&amp;nbsp;– Origin &amp; Functions |publisher=Msa.md.gov |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fitch Ratings]] assigned a 'AAA' bond rating to Prince George's County on August 25, 2011, re-affirming the county's stable financial outlook. Earlier in 2011, the county received 'AAA' status from [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] and [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]].  'AAA' bond ratings are the highest possible bond ratings a jurisdiction can receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.princegeorgescountymd.gov/ExecutiveNews/Lists/Executive%20News%20Baker%20Administration/DispForm.aspx?ID=350 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707053237/http://cms.princegeorgescountymd.gov/ExecutiveNews/Lists/Executive%20News%20Baker%20Administration/DispForm.aspx?ID=350 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |title=Fitch Assigns 'AAA' Bond Rating to Prince George's County |publisher=Prince George's County, Maryland Homepage |date=August 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince George's County is a Democratic stronghold, having voted majority-Democratic in every presidential election but four since 1932: [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s two candidacies in [[1952 United States presidential election in Maryland|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election in Maryland|1956]], and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s successful candidaces in [[1968 United States presidential election in Maryland|1968]] and [[1972 United States presidential election in Maryland|1972]].&lt;!--see &quot;Presidential election results&quot;--&gt;

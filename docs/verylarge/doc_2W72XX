In economic terms, pollution from fossil fuels is regarded as a negative [[externality]]. Taxation is considered as one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of associated pollution, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these effects.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

According to Rodman D. Griffin, &quot;The burning of coal and oil have saved inestimable amounts of time and labor while substantially raising living standards around the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CQ Researcher&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Rodman|title=Alternative Energy|date=10 July 1992|volume=2|issue=2|pages=573–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of fossil fuels may seem beneficial to our lives, it plays a role in global warming and it is said to be dangerous for the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;CQ Researcher&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, this environmental pollution impacts humans because [[particulates]] and other [[air pollution]] from fossil fuel combustion cause illness and death when inhaled by people. These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. The poor, undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health, are more at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liodakis|first1=E|title=The nuclear alternative|journal=Energy Production within Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia|year=2011|volume=1342|issue=1|page=91|doi=10.1063/1.3583174|series=AIP Conference Proceedings|last2=Dashdorj|first2=Dugersuren|last3=Mitchell|first3=Gary E.|bibcode=2011AIPC.1342...91L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Air pollution from fossil fuels in 2018 has been estimated to cost US$2.9 trillion, or 3.3% of global GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Quantifying the Economic Costs of Air Pollution from Fossil Fuels|url=https://energyandcleanair.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cost-of-fossil-fuels-briefing.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406173555/https://energyandcleanair.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cost-of-fossil-fuels-briefing.pdf|archive-date=6 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidy===
The [[International Energy Agency]] estimated 2017 global government [[fossil fuel subsidies]] to have been $300 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fossil-fuel subsidies |url=https://www.iea.org/weo/energysubsidies/ |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |access-date=7 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204133103/https://www.iea.org/weo/energysubsidies/ |archive-date=4 February 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report spans the period 2008–2012 and notes that: &quot;For all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their {{CO2}} emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2008.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hope-etal-2015&quot;/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Pure coal companies fare even worse: &quot;the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hope-etal-2015&quot;/&gt;{{rp|5}}  In this case, total revenue includes &quot;employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hope-etal-2015&quot;/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Fossil fuel prices generally are below their actual costs, or their &quot;efficient prices,&quot; when  [[Externality|economic externalities]], such as the costs of air pollution and global climate destruction, are taken into account. Fossil fuels are subsidized in the amount of $4.7 trillion in 2015, which is equivalent to 6.3% of the 2015 global  [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and are estimated to grow to $5.2 trillion in 2017, which is equivalent to 6.5% of global GDP. The largest five subsidizers in 2015 were the following: China with $1.4 trillion in fossil fuel subsidies, United States with $649 billion, Russia with $551 billion, the European Union with $289 billion, and India with $209 billion. Had there been no subsidies for fossil fuels, global carbon emissions would have been lowered by an estimated 28% in 2015, air-pollution related deaths reduced by 46%, and government revenue increased by $2.8 trillion or 3.8% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF), May 2019, [https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/WP/2019/WPIEA2019089.ashx &quot;IMF Working Paper, Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies Remain Large: An Update Based on Country-Level Estimates&quot;], Abstract and p. 24, WP/19/89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art rock''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that generally reflects a challenging or [[avant-garde]] approach to rock, or which makes use of [[modernist]], experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from entertainment to an artistic statement,{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36651/art-rock &quot;Art Rock&quot;]. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Influences may be drawn from genres such as [[experimental rock]], [[avant-garde music]], [[classical music]], and [[jazz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prog-rock&quot;/&gt;

Its music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for [[dance music|dancing]],&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and [[easy listening]] textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with &quot;[[progressive rock]]&quot;, though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of [[classically trained]] instrumental technique and [[symphonic]] textures.

The genre's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists. The music, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of [[punk rock|punk]] in the mid 1970s.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=49}}  After, the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Critic [[John Rockwell]] says that art rock is one of rock's most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment, [[classical music]] pretensions, and experimental, [[avant-garde]] proclivities.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=146}}  In the rock music of the 1970s, the &quot;art&quot; descriptor was generally understood to mean &quot;aggressively avant-garde&quot; or &quot;pretentiously progressive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtPunkMurray&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=60 minutes of music that sum up art-punk pioneers Wire|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/60-minutes-music-sum-art-punk-pioneers-wire-219113|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Art rock&quot; is often used synonymously with [[progressive rock]].{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=251}}{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=146}}&lt;ref name=&quot;prog-rock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/prog-rock-ma0000002798|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Pop/Rock » Art-Rock/Experimental » Prog-Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Historically, the term has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}} The first is progressive rock, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected [[psychedelia]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] in favor of a [[modernist]], avant-garde approach defined by [[the Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=37}} Essayist [[Ellen Willis]] compared these two types:

{{quote|From the early sixties … there was a counter-tradition in rock and roll that had much more in common with high art—in particular avant-garde art—than the ballyhooed art-rock synthesis [progressive rock]; it involved more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock and roll as material (much as pop artists used mass art in general) and refining, elaborating, playing off that material to produce … rockand-roll art. While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock and roll was or could be as worthy as more established art forms, rock-and-roll art came out of an obsessive commitment to the language of rock and roll and an equally obsessive disdain for those who rejected that language or wanted it watered down, made easier … the new wave has inherited the counter-tradition.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|pp=37–38}}}}

[[File:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pink Floyd]] performing their [[concept album]] ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973)]]

Art rock emphasizes [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and autonomous traditions, in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by [[art pop]].{{sfn|Frith|Horne|2016|p=98}} Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman's ''American Popular Music'' defines art rock as a &quot;form of rock music that blended elements of rock and European classical music&quot;, citing the English rock bands [[King Crimson]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], and [[Pink Floyd]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.oup.com/us/companion.websites/019530053X/studentresources/chapter11/key_terms/ |title=Key Terms and Definitions |accessdate=16 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503032559/http://www.us.oup.com/us/companion.websites/019530053X/studentresources/chapter11/key_terms/ |archivedate=3 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common characteristics include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs, with usually complicated and long instrumental sections, symphonic orchestration.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Its music was traditionally used within the context of [[concept album|concept record]]s, and its lyrical themes tended to be &quot;imaginative&quot; and politically oriented.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock, with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or [[experimental music|experimental]] influences and &quot;novel sonic structure&quot;, while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique, literary content, and [[Symphony|symphonic]] features.&lt;ref name=&quot;prog-rock&quot;/&gt; Compared to progressive rock, art rock is &quot;more challenging, noisy and unconventional&quot; and &quot;less classically influenced&quot;, with more of an emphasis on [[avant-garde music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prog-rock&quot;/&gt; Similarities are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility,&lt;ref name=&quot;prog-rock&quot;/&gt; and became the instrumental analog to concept albums and [[rock opera]]s, which were typically more vocal oriented.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=845}}

Art rock can also refer to either classically driven rock, or to a progressive rock-[[folk music|folk]] fusion.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Bruce Eder's essay ''The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock'' states that &quot;'progressive rock,' also sometimes known as 'art rock,' or 'classical rock'&quot; is music in which the &quot;bands [are] playing suites, not songs; borrowing riffs from Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner instead of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]]; and using language closer to [[William Blake]] or [[T. S. Eliot]] than to [[Carl Perkins]] or [[Willie Dixon]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vanguardchurch.com/the_history_of_art_rock.htm |contribution=The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock |first=Bruce |last=Eder |title=All-Music Guide Essay |publisher=Vanguar Church |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124125424/http://www.vanguardchurch.com/the_history_of_art_rock.htm |archivedate=24 January 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|
 |quote=In the late sixties and early seventies, rock both co-opted and challenged the prevailing view of [[musical art]], often at the same time. This is evident in a diverse body of music that includes [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' and [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper]]''; [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[Freak Out!|Freak Out]]'' ... [[the Who]]'s [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''; [[Pink Floyd]]'s technologically advanced concept album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon|Dark Side of the Moon]]''; and [[Miles Davis]]'s [[jazz fusion|jazz/rock fusion]].

The boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=1233}} The first usage of the term &quot;art rock&quot;, according to [[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]], was in 1968.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt; As pop music's dominant format [[Album Era|transitioned from singles to albums]],{{refn|group=nb|[[The Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Phil Spector]], and [[Frank Zappa]] all indicated a direction that transformed long-playing records into a creative format while variously reciprocating each others' creative developments throughout the 1960s.{{sfn|Julien|2008|pp=30, 160}}}} many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements, where art rock would flourish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holden&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=28 February 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/arts/music-they-re-recording-but-are-they-artists.html|title=MUSIC; They're Recording, but Are They Artists?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it progressed in the late 1960s – in tandem with the development of progressive rock – art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock.{{sfn|Rosenberg|2009|p=179}}

====Proponents====
[[File:MFQ with Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phil Spector]] (center) in the studio with [[folk rock]] band [[Modern Folk Quartet]], 1966]]

The earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter [[Phil Spector]], who became known as an [[auteur]] for his [[Wall of Sound]] productions that aspired to a &quot;classical grandiosity&quot;.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=48}} According to biographer [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]: &quot;[Spector] created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.&quot;{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=15–16}} Williams also says that Spector transformed rock music as a performing art into an art that could only exist in the recording studio, which &quot;paved the way for art rock&quot;.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=38}}

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976 crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Brian Wilson]] in the studio, 1976]]

Many of the top British groups during the 1960s – including members of the Beatles, [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Who]], [[10cc]], [[the Move]], [[the Yardbirds]] and Pink Floyd – came to music via [[art school]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Frith|1989|p=208}} This institution differed from its US counterpart in terms of having a less industry-applicable syllabus and in its focus on furthering eccentric talent.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=xiii–xiv}} By the mid-1960s, several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality, where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of US-derived musical styles, such as [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] and [[R&amp;B]].{{sfn|Lindberg et al.|2005|pp=104–06}}

According to journalist [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]], many popular musicians from California (like Wilson) desired to be acknowledged as artists, and struggled with this aspiration. Goldstein explains that the line between violating musical conventions and making &quot;truly popular music&quot; caused those who didn't have &quot;strong enough egos&quot; (in contrast to [[Bob Dylan]] and the Beatles) to be &quot;doomed to a respectful rejection, and a few albums with disappointing sales usually meant silence. ... They yearned for fame, as only needy people can, but they also wanted to make art, and when both of those impulses couldn’t be achieved they recoiled in a ball of frantic confusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=GoldsteinSalon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|authorlink=Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|title=I got high with the Beach Boys: &quot;If I survive this I promise never to do drugs again&quot;|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/04/26/i_got_high_with_the_beach_boys_if_i_survive_this_i_promise_never_to_do_drugs_again/|work=[[salon (website)|Salon]]|date=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Matthew Bannister traces &quot;the more self-conscious, camp aesthetic of art rock&quot; to pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] and the Velvet Underground, who emulated Warhol's art/pop synthesis.{{sfn|Bannister|2007|pp=26, 45}} Accordingly: &quot;Warhol took Spector's combination of the disembodiment, 'distance' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ... But Warhol’s aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than Spector's, which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern, detached tenets of pop art. ... Warhol's approach reverberates throughout art rock, most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement.&quot;{{sfn|Bannister|2007|pp=40, 44}}

=====1965–66=====
The December 1965 release of the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' signified a watershed for the pop album,{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=64}} transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form, filled with high-quality original compositions.{{sfn|Perone|2004|p=23}} The album garnered recognition for the Beatles as artists from the American mainstream press,{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=595}} anticipating rock music's cultural legitimization as an art form.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=122}} Writing in 1968, [[Gene Sculatti]] of ''[[Jazz &amp; Pop]]'' recognized ''Rubber Soul'' as &quot;the definitive 'rock as art' album&quot; and &quot;the necessary prototype&quot; that major artists such as the Rolling Stones (with ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'') and the Beach Boys had felt compelled to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sculatti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sculatti|first=Gene|authorlink=Gene Sculatti|url=http://www.teachrock.org/resources/article/villains-and-heroes-in-defense-of-the-beach-boys/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714191639/http://teachrock.org/resources/article/villains-and-heroes-in-defense-of-the-beach-boys/ |title=Villains and Heroes: In Defense of the Beach Boys|magazine=[[Jazz &amp; Pop]]|date=September 1968|publisher=teachrock.org|archivedate=14 July 2014|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Edmondson's 2013 encyclopedia ''Music in American Life'' states that, although it was preceded by earlier examples, [[Frank Zappa]] and the Mothers of Invention's debut album ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (June 1966) came to be seen as &quot;the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context&quot;. With Los Angeles as his base since the early 1960s, Zappa was able to work in an environment where student radicalism was closely aligned with an active avant-garde scene, a setting that placed the city ahead of other countercultural centres at the time and would continue to inform his music.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=1233}} Writer and pianist Michael Campbell comments that the album &quot;contains a long noncategorical list of Zappa's influences, from classical avant-garde composers to obscure folk musicians&quot;.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=251}}

The Beatles' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (August 1966) furthered the album-as-art perspective{{sfn|Perone|2004|pp=118–19}} and continued pop music's evolution.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=2}} Led by the art-rock single &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot;,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=138}} it expanded the genre's scope in terms of the range of musical styles, which included Indian, avant-garde and classical, and the lyrical content of the album,{{sfn|Greene|2016|pp=9, 21–22}} and also in its departure from previous notions of melody and structure in pop songwriting.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=67}} According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', &quot;''Revolver'' signaled that in popular music, anything – any theme, any musical idea – could now be realized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-beatles-revolver-20120524 |author=Rolling Stone staff|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: 3.

The Beatles' [[Paul McCartney]] deemed ''Pet Sounds'' &quot;the record of the time&quot;, and in June 1967, the band responded with their own album: ''Sgt.

La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548, by the Spanish [[conquistador]] Captain [[Alonso de Mendoza]] at the site of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] settlement of [[Laja, Bolivia|Laja]] as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from [[Potosí]] and [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] to [[Lima]]; the full name of the city was originally ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of [[Peace]]'') in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the [[Rebellion|insurrection]] of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow conquistadors against the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]].

In 1781, the [[indigenous people|indigenous]] leader and independence activist [[Túpac Katari]] laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809, the Bolivian patriot [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American Wars of Independence]], which gained the freedom of South American states in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boliviabella.com/history-of-la-paz.html|title=The History of La Paz, Bolivia|website=boliviabella.com|publisher=Bolivia Bella|access-date=14 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901214920/http://www.boliviabella.com/history-of-la-paz.html|archive-date=1 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of La Paz}}
[[File:Palace of gov, la paz.jpg|left|thumb|Government Palace of Bolivia in downtown La Paz]]

This area had been the site of an Inca city on a major trading route.

Although the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s entered the area in 1535, they did not found La Paz until 1548. Originally it was to be at the site of the [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] settlement, [[Laja, Bolivia|Laja]], with the full name of the city being ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of [[Peace]]''). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the insurrection of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespo-1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Crespo, Alberto (Alberto Crespo Rodas) |author-link=:es:Alberto Crespo Rodas |year=1998 |title=450 Anos De La Fundación De La Paz |location=Cochabamba, Bolivia |publisher=Canelas }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town site was moved a few days later to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago, which is more clement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespo-1&quot; /&gt;

Control over the former [[Inca]] lands had been entrusted to [[Pedro de la Gasca]] by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. Gasca commanded [[Alonso de Mendoza]] to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by Alonzo de Mendoza, with Juan de Vargas appointed as its first mayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crespo-2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Crespo, Alberto (Alberto Crespo Rodas) |author-link=:es:Alberto Crespo Rodas|year=1980 |title=Alonzo de Mendoza: Fundador de La Paz |location=La Paz, Bolivia |publisher=Biblioteca Popular Boliviana de Última Hora }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1549, Juan Gutierrez Paniagua was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. These were meant to express the ideals and relationships of Spanish colonial society. La Plaza de los Españoles, which is known today as the Plaza Murillo, was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.

Spain controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political, but consultation was extended, taking months or longer by sea. Indigenous and other unrest was repeated around the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of [[Aymara people]] laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of [[Tupac Katari]], they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later Indians conducted a two-month siege against La Paz. This incident was the setting for the origin of the legend of the [[Ekeko]]. In 1809 the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. On July 16, 1809 [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This uprising formally marked the beginning of the liberation of South America from Spain. The first open rebellions against the Spanish Crown took place in La Paz and the city of Sucre simultaneously. This event is known as the Primer Grito Libertario de América.

Pedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Españoles that night. After Bolivia gained independence, La Paz named this plaza after him, to commemorate him always. He is remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.

In 1825, after the decisive victory of the [[republicanism|republican]]s at [[Ayacucho]] over the Spanish army in the course of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], the city's full name was changed to ''La Paz de Ayacucho'' (meaning ''The Peace of Ayacucho'').

[[File:Palacio del Congreso Nacional La Paz Bolivia.jpg|thumb|Legislative Palace of Bolivia]]

In 1898, La Paz was made the ''[[de facto]]'' seat of the national government, with Sucre remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted [[silver]] [[mining|mine]]s of [[Potosí]] to the exploitation of [[tin]] near [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national [[elite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553809/La_Paz.html La Paz],&quot; Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008. Retrieved November 10, 2008. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091029041432/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553809/La_Paz.html Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Amaneciendo en La Paz con el Illimani de fondo.jpg|left|thumb|The city in winter, with [[Illimani]] in the background.]]
[[File:Valledelaluna-lapaz-bolivia.jpg|thumb|[[Valle de la Luna (Bolivia)|Valle de la Luna]] (&quot;moon valley&quot;)]]

La Paz is built in a canyon created by the [[Choqueyapu River]] (now mostly built over), which runs northwest to southeast. The city's main thoroughfare, which roughly follows the river, changes names over its length, but the central tree-lined section running through the downtown core is called the Prado.

The geography of La Paz (in particular the altitude) is marked by social differences. The more affluent residents live in the lower, central areas of the city southwest of the Prado. Many middle-class residents live in high-rise condos near the center. Lower-income residents live in makeshift brick houses in the surrounding hills.

The satellite city of El Alto, where the airport is, is spread over a broad area to the west of the canyon, on the Altiplano. La Paz is renowned for its unique markets, unusual and dramatic topography, and traditional culture.

La Paz is in the valleys of the Andes, close to the Eastern split of the Altiplano region. It is closer to such notable mountains as the Illimani (guardian of La Paz), Huayna Potosi, Mururata, and Illampu. On the Western side of the Altiplano divide, about an hour to the west of the La Paz, is the Sajama Volcano, the tallest mountain in Bolivia and ninth-tallest mountain in the Andes.

An [[1994 Bolivia earthquake|earthquake in July 1994]] rated at 8.2 struck {{convert|200|mi|0|abbr=out}} north of La Paz. It could be felt near La Paz and caused damage throughout the villages of the area.

At more than {{convert|4000|m|ft}} above sea level, higher parts of La Paz have an unusual [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwc'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety (Cfc, Cwc)|subpolar oceanic]] characteristics (less than 4 months have a mean temperature above 10&amp;nbsp;°C), bordering on a [[Polar climate|tundra climate]] (''ET''). The whole city has rainy summers and dry winters. Night-time temperatures range from cold to very cold. [[Snow flurry|Snow flurries]] can occur in winter, especially at dawn and it usually melts before noon. At these high altitudes despite being located only 16 degrees from the equator, the city's average temperature is similar to that of cities such as [[Bergen]], [[Norway]] or [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]], located as far as 60 and 62 degrees from the equator respectively.

The temperatures in the central La Paz, at {{convert|3600|m|0|abbr=off}}, and in the ''Zona Sur'' (Southern Zone), at {{convert|3250|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, are warmer ([[Oceanic climate|subtropical highland climate]] ''Cwb'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate-Data.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/764108/ |title=Climate: La Paz (altitude: 3610m) - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2014-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105061638/http://en.climate-data.org/location/764108/ |archive-date=2014-01-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the Köppen classification).

Owing to the altitude of the city, temperatures are consistently cool to mild throughout the year, though the [[diurnal temperature variation]] is typically large. The city has a relatively dry climate, with rainfall occurring mainly in the slightly warmer months of November to March.

In the highest part of the city, above 4,000 metres, the two cloudiest months are February and March, in late summer, when sunshine averages around 5 hours per day. The two sunniest months are June and July, in winter, when sunshine averages around 8 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-paz.climatemps.com/index.php|title=La Paz Climate La Paz Temperatures La Paz Weather Averages|access-date=2015-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616071238/http://www.la-paz.climatemps.com/index.php|archive-date=2015-06-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy precipitation typically occurs throughout summer, and often causes destructive [[Mudflow|mudslides]]. At an altitude of 3,250 metres, in the southern part of the city, the wettest month is January with a monthly average of {{convert|114|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the driest is July with {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The warmest temperature recorded was {{convert|27.0|C|F|1|}} and the coldest was {{convert|-12.5|C|F|1|}}.

[[File:Panlapaz 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|left|La Paz skyline from the &quot;Via Balcón&quot;.]]

; San Jorge : Located in the district known as Cotahuma and near [[Sopocachi]], is one of the main residential and diplomatic areas of the city. San Jorge is one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of La Paz and the financial center of the metropolis, housing international firms like [[Deloitte]], [[Bank of America]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[BBVA]] and the famous [[The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Ritz Hotel]]. It is now home of Bolivia's tallest building known as Torre Girasoles, and the only [[intelligent building]] of the country, known as Torre Azul. The neighborhood is also populated with expensive offices, renowned restaurants, museums and bookstores. Its Avenida Arce, one of the main streets of the city, is the highest-priced street in the country and the one with the most upscale boutiques in Bolivia. San Jorge is home to the embassies of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]. The offices of the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[CAF – Development Bank of Latin America]], the [[Goethe Institut]], the [[Alliance Française]] and the [[Dante Alighieri Society]] are also located in this modern neighborhood.

; [[Sopocachi]] : Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), Sopocachi is probably one of the oldest residential neighborhoods, 10 minutes from the center of the city. Despite the expansion and development of the area, this quarter maintained its residential property. In the last years, there has been an important commercial expansion, mainly on the surroundings of Abaroa Square, one of the many squares and parks of the zone.

; San Pedro : Located in the 1st District (Cotahuma), on the right bank of the Choqueyapu River and built around the &quot;Plaza de San Pedro&quot; (official name: Plaza Sucre, ''Sucre Square''), is home to numerous shops, businesses and small enterprises, especially printing, spare parts and auto maintenance and repair shops. San Pedro's &quot;Rodriguez Market&quot; remains as one of the most popular [[middle-class]] and oldest of the city. The [[San Pedro prison]] is here.

; Centro : The city's downtown area, in the 7th District, comprising the center of La Paz and principal roads of the city, like Arce Avenue, July 16 Avenue (also known as &quot;Prado Avenue&quot;), Mariscal Santa Cruz Avenue and Camacho Avenue — the last one being the home of the headquarters of the principal banks and companies of the country.
; Casco Viejo : Located in the 7th District, is the historic and ancient center of La Paz. It now houses museums, hotels, shops and buildings as the Mayor City of La Paz and the [[Central Bank of Bolivia]]. In the Old Quarter is the [[Plaza Murillo]], which is home to the Government Palace and the National Congress.

[[File:Calacoto La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|250px|The Southern District is one of the most affluent neighborhoods in La Paz.]]
; Miraflores : In the 7th District, Miraflores district is separated from downtown by a long barrel (''Parque Urbano Central'', &quot;Central Urban Park&quot;) and connected by the Bridge of the Americas and two avenues. Originally a residential zone, its growth has led it to become a major recreational center. It houses universities (including the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andrés]]'s faculty of medicine), hospitals and the [[Estadio Hernando Siles]] (capacity of 45,000 people).

; Northern District : Located in the 2nd and 3rd districts, it has a significant industrial activity (mainly food), being the Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (Bolivian National Brewery) the most significant industry founded by Germans, and one of the city's biggest companies in the country. It connects La Paz with the city of El Alto by the ''autopista'' (highway).

; Southern District : In the 5th district; has less height than the rest of La Paz (3,200 to 2,800 meters). This area houses some of the most affluent and exclusive neighborhoods of the city, like Obrajes, Irpavi, [[Calacoto]], La Florida and Achumani, among others. It has been benefited from steady economic growth and is now the second commercial and financial center of the city, housing international firms like [[Moody's]], [[Citibank]], [[Aon Corporation]], [[Huawei]], [[Millicom]] International Cellular, [[Nissan Motor Corporation]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Pan American Silver Corporation]], a [[Sumitomo Corporation]] branch, [[Ernst &amp; Young]], and the &quot;MegaCenter&quot;, La Paz's biggest shopping mall.

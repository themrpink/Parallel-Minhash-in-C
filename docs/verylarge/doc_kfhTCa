The history of Brunei before the arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s ships in 1519-1522 CE is based on speculation, the interpretation of Chinese sources, and local legends. Historians believe that there was a forerunner to the present day Brunei Sultanate. One possible predecessor state was called Vijayapura, which possibly existed in northwest [[Borneo]] in the 7th century.{{efn|1=Not to be confused with the [[Vijayapura|Indian state of the same name]].}} It was probably a subject state of the powerful [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]].  One predecessor state was called Po-ni (pinyin: Boni).&lt;ref&gt;This view recently has been challenged. See Johannes L. Kurz &quot;Boni in Chinese Sources: Translations of Relevant Texts from the Song to the Qing Dynasties&quot;, paper accessible under http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=172 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 10th century Po-ni had contacts with first the [[Song Dynasty|Song dynasty]] and at some point even entered into a tributary relationship with China.  By the 14th century Po-ni also fell under the influence of the Indianised Hindu [[Java]]nese [[Majapahit]] Empire. The book of [[Nagarakretagama]], canto 14, written by Prapanca in 1365 mentioned ''Berune'' as a vassal state of Majahpahit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher=Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | archive-date=23 May 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However this may have been nothing more than a symbolic relationship, as one account of the annual tribute owed each year to Majahpahit was a jar of [[areca]] juice obtained from the young green nuts of the areca palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|author=Hose, Charles|authorlink=Charles Hose|wstitle=Brunei|volume=4|pages=681–682|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming dynasty resumed communications with Po-ni in the 1370s and the Po-ni ruler Ma-na-jih-chia-na visited the Ming capital Nanjing in 1408 and died there; [[Tomb of the King of Boni|his tomb]] was rediscovered in the 20th century, and is now a protected monument.

== Chinese settlement and the Kinabatangan ==
{{Main|Kinabatangan|Kinabatangan River}}
The greater part of the official historical record for early Brunei until the arrival of Pigafetta is based on legends and assumptions.

The historical account – lacking any real evidence – has been constructed in such a way that around 1370, [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuan Zhang]] sent representatives to Brunei and Indonesia, and Brunei paid tribute to the Ming Chinese, which signified the strong influence of the Ming Dynasty and accounts for the combination of [[Ong Sum Ping]]'s influence in Brunei. the account that follows below is the version currently accepted in Brunei, but challenged by a number of scholars because it lacks factual substance.

In 1402, after the death of [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Sultan Muhammad Shah]] (or known before converting to Islam, Awang Alak Betatar), his son Abdul Majid Hasan ascended the throne. Ong Sum Ping and Pengiran Temenggong became [[regent]]s. Bruneian history has seldom treated Hasan as the second Sultan. In 1406, after the death of Sultan Majid Hasan, there existed a two-year power vacuum. During this two years, Bruneian nobles were locked in a power struggle; in the end, with the clever maneuvering of Ong Sum Ping, Sultan Ahmad came out victorious and Pengiran Temenggong's faction lost. Ahmad thus became the second Sultan in Bruneian official History. Sultan Ahmad was married to a sister of Ong Sum Ping. To further cement his influence on the new sultan, Ong Sum Ping advised the sultan that a visit to China, a regional Asian power at that time was good. Thus, the new sultan sent Ong Sum Ping and several court officials as representatives to China to assure the new Ming Dynasty of continued tributary relationship. Ong Sum Ping and his entourage landed in the coastal region of Fujian; [[Yongle emperor|emperor Yong Le]] had officials organised a welcome party for Ong Sum Ping.

Advanced in age, Ong Sum Ping could not make the long journey back to Brunei, and died in Nanjing. Prior to his death, he had pleaded with Emperor Yong Le to grant several wishes among which (1) that Brunei continued to be a tributary kingdom, (2) Sungai Kinabatangan and the surrounding area, decades ago under the province of the Mongol Yuan dynasty of China, be re-annexed as Chinese territory, (3) that the highest mountain in the territory be named &quot;Kinabalu&quot; or &quot;new China&quot; or alternatively some say &quot;Chinese Widow&quot;. Emperor Yong Le granted his wish and further conferred upon Ong's son Awang as the new ruler, and named the mountain of Brunei as Chang Ning Mountainجبل السلام – mean Jabel Alsalam (&quot;mountain of peace&quot;) in Arabic.

In 1408, Awang returned to Brunei under the escort of Chinese Imperial eunuchs, officials, and soldiers. Awang succeeded to the position of Ong Sum Ping in Brunei, and continued to exercise political power and influence upon the sultan. The Chinese still referred to him as Chung Ping – General. In 1412, he paid tribute to Emperor Yong Le. The wife of Ong Sum Ping was also buried in Brunei at a location which the local Malays called Bukit Cina. The sister of Ong Sum Ping, who was the wife of Sultan Ahmad gave birth to a daughter. This daughter later inherited the throne and her consort became Sultan Sharif Ali (so he was Sayyidina), who came from the Arabian Peninsula. Sultan Sharif Ali was a descendant of [[Muhammad]]. The granddaughter and the Arabian were the ancestors of today's sultan of Brunei.

Bruneians today, still believe that Ong Sum Ping was an ancestor of the Brunei royalty. Even though the Bruneian royal family stressed more on the concept of [[Melayu Islam Beraja]] ملاي إسلام براج, but they do not discount the Chinese connection. Ong Sum Ping's name was recorded under the genealogy of the Sultans of Brunei. In the capital of Brunei—Bandar Seri Begawan (similar with श्री भगवान् in Sanskrit), there exist a street named Jalan Ong Sum Ping, and the Muzium Brunei also contained artifacts of Ong Sum Ping. The tomb of Ong Sum Ping's son is also under the Bruneian government heritage protection.

The historical &quot;Silsilah Raja-raja Sulu&quot; provide further evidence of Ong Sum Ping's existence. According to the record of the Silsilah Raja-raja Sulu, Ong Sum Ping arrived at Brunei with several Chinese soldiers on a commission to collect a certain precious Jewell, called Gomala, in North Borneo, assumed to be on the highest mountain and said to be guarded by a dragon. Ong Sum Ping and his men later landed on the eastern coast of North Borneo. The Chinese explorers knew from vast experience that to reach a high mountain they had to logically start from the big river mouth and move ever upwards to the source of the river. Ong Sum Ping set up a staging station on the Kinabatangan river and sent men upriver. Unfortunately, the source of the Kinabatangan river is not on Mount Kinabalu. After the demise of Ong Sum Ping, Awang the new raja of Kinabatangan sent an expedition, this time up the Labuk River. It only managed to set up another staging station at the confluence of the Liwagu Kogibangan and Liwagu Kawananan.

== The Nunuk Ragang Connection ==

Later this staging station became the permanent settlement now known as [[Nunuk Ragang]] the original home of the Kadazan-Dusun race. At the staging station the Chinese hung red colored pieces of fabric and red colored banner to indicate their presence to any follow-up parties. Red is an important symbolic color in Chinese culture, and even today whenever the Chinese set up a new project such as land development, they never neglect to set up a red coloured altar and offer sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;On, Low Kok (2006). ''Reading Symbols and Mythical Landscape in the &quot;Tambunan Dusun Origin Myth&quot; ''Kota Kinabalu:Universiti Malaysia Sabah. pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no zoological record of a red coloured [[Banyan Tree]] so it can only be assumed that to the simple native mind the Banyan tree has turned red, hence the name Nunuk Ragang. The offspring of the soldiers, porters and local natives women became the ancestors of the Kadazan-Dusun race. This explain the reason behind the many similarities in language between the natives of Taiwan and the Kadazan-Dusun language. The ethnic [[Tagahas]], warlike and aggressive claim they are the descendants of soldiers.  Additionally, the local native women were themselves descendants of previous waves of migrations of Austronesian people from mainland China and Taiwan to [[Australia (continent)|Sahul]], and also during the Mongol Empire [[Yuan dynasty]] under Kublai Khan, in 1292, during which Sulu and Northern Borneo became a province under the Mongol Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, Owen (1922).''British North Borneo: An Account of its History, Resources and Native Tribes.''London: Constable and Company Limited. p.84-85&lt;/ref&gt; When, on a visit to China with the Sultan of Brunei in 1408, Ong Sum Ping died, his son, Awang returned as the new Raja of Kinabatangan three years later. Meanwhile, the settlement at Nunuk Ragang had already been well established and thriving. The new Raja, having converted to Islam was no longer interested in Jewell and dragon, but more concerned with court affairs having been appointed an important adviser to the Brunei Sultanate. Trading in the abundant resources at Kinabatangan became his most primary concern and the men at Nunuk Ragang was abandoned and left to fend for themselves.

According to this record, Ong Sum Ping didn't become Sultan, but his daughter was married to the Sultan, and he became the Sultan's father-in-law. Bruneian royal houses adopted the maternal succession system; it is known for certain that his maternal granddaughter became the Queen of Sultan Sharif Ali. However, it is believed that the year might be in 1375, not in the Yuan Dynasty, but in the 8th year of Emperor Hong Wu.

== Relations with Europeans ==
Brunei's relations varied with the different European powers in the region.  The Portuguese, for the most part, were more interested in economic and trading relations with the regional powers and did little to interfere with Brunei's development.  This does not mean that relations were always cordial, such as in 1536 when the Portuguese attacked the Muslims in the [[Moluccas]] and the ambassador to the Brunei court had to leave because of the sultan's hostility.  The Portuguese also noted that the sultanate was heavily involved in the region's politics and wars, and that Brunei merchants could be found in [[Ligor]] and [[Thailand|Siam]].

Relations with [[Spain]] were far more hostile.  From 1565 on, Spanish and Brunei forces engaged in a number of naval skirmishes, and in 1571 the Spanish who had been sending expeditions from Mexico succeeded in capturing [[Manila]] from the Brunei aristocracy that had been established there.  Brunei raised several large fleets with the intention of recapturing the city, but the campaigns, for various reasons, never launched.{{efn|1=The Chinese pirate [[Limahon]] attacked Manila in December 1574, but Brunei was unable to take advantage of the Spaniards' distraction.}} In 1578, the Spanish took Sulu and in April [[Castille War|attacked and captured Brunei]] itself, after demanding that the sultan cease [[Islamic Missionary Activity#Missionary activity in Southeast Asia|proselytising]] in the Philippines and, in turn, allow [[Christian missionaries]] to be active in his kingdom. The Spaniards withdrew after suffering heavy losses due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frankham|2008|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atiyah|2002|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short-term damage to the sultanate was minimal, as [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]] regained its independence soon after. However, Brunei failed to regain a foothold in [[Luzon]], with the island firmly in Spanish hands.

The long-term effects of regional changes could not be avoided.  After Sultan Hassan, Brunei entered a period of decline, due to internal battles over royal succession as well as the rising influences of European colonial powers in the region, that, among other things, disrupted traditional trading patterns, destroying the economic base of Brunei and many other Southeast Asian sultanates.

== Relationship with the British and Sarawak ==
During Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddin II]]’s reign, disturbances occurred in [[Sarawak]]. In 1839, the British adventurer [[James Brooke]] arrived in Borneo and helped the Sultan put down this rebellion.

As a reward, he became governor and later &quot;White Rajah&quot; of Sarawak and gradually expanded the territory under his control. Brooke never gained control of Brunei, though he did attempt to. He asked the British to check whether or not it would be acceptable for him to claim Brunei as his own; however, they came back with bad news—although Brunei was poorly governed, it had a definite sense of national identity and could therefore not be absorbed by Brooke.

In 1843 an open conflict between Brooke and the Sultan ended in the latter's defeat. The Sultan recognised Sarawak's independence. In 1846, [[Brunei Town]] was attacked and captured by the British and Sultan Saifuddin II was forced to sign a treaty to end the British occupation of Brunei Town. In the same year, Sultan Saifuddin II ceded [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]] to the British under the Treaty of Labuan. In 1847, he signed the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the British and in 1850, he signed a similar treaty with the United States, which, after a series of events, resulted in the first consul of the US, Charles Lee Moses, burning down his consulate. Over the years, the Sultans of Brunei ceded further stretches of territory to Sarawak; in 1877, stretches to the east of the capital were leased (later ceded) to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] ([[North Borneo]]). Eventually, due to these seizures of territory, which was accepted by the sultan for annual lease payments, the British occupied the vast majority of the coast of Brunei. The Sultan only stopped handing over territory when [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]] asked for [[Limbang]], which the Sultan refused. Against the Sultan's wishes, Sarawak obtained control over the territory.

In 1906, the British started a [[Resident (title)|residency]] in Brunei. This was averted from greater British control from a friendly report by [[Malcolm Stewart Hannibal McArthur]], who prevented the nation from being colonized completely, in the Report on Brunei in 1904. This residency, with the Sultan having control over internal policies, continued until 1984. During this residency, oil was discovered, in 1928, by Shell. This is what has changed the country from its former impoverished state to a much wealthier one today.

== Prior to Independence ==
The Sultan of Brunei participated in efforts to form a federation of [[Malaysia]] with the [[Federation of Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo]] and the [[Colony of Singapore]], but decided not to in the end due to the issue of oil profits and massive popular opinion against the move. This wish by the sultan resulted in a [[Brunei revolt|coup]] by the most populous party in the nation, comprising a vast majority of the population, by the [[Brunei People's Party]] (PRB). This failed due to poor organisation and their leader, [[A.M. Azahari]], not even being in the country during the coup. Another option considered was a [[North Borneo Federation|federation]] between North Borneo, Sarawak, and Brunei, but this was rejected due to oil revenues and the possible limitation of the Sultan's power. 

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:

* Brunei was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
* Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[British Military Garrison Brunei|Gurkha units]] to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the UK. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters. In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title &quot;[[Majesty|His Majesty]]&quot;, rather than the previous &quot;[[His Royal Highness]]&quot;. Brunei was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.&lt;!-- This sub-section is copied from the article entitled &quot;Brunei&quot; --&gt;

== After Independence ==
Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, joining ASEAN on the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/brunei/bntimeln.htm|title=Brunei Time Line Chronological Timetable of Events - Worldatlas.com|website=www.worldatlas.com|access-date=2019-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic growth from its extensive petroleum and natural gas fields during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] country. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[Southeast Asian]]  nations, after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a &quot;[[developed country]]&quot;. In 2014, the [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan]] instituted an [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia|Sharia penal code]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- This sub-section is partially copied from the article entitled &quot;Brunei&quot; --&gt;

{{History of Bulgaria}} 
The '''history of Bulgaria''' can be traced from the first settlements on the lands of [[Bulgaria|modern Bulgaria]] to its formation as a nation-state, and includes the history of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian people]] and their origin. The earliest evidence of hominid occupation discovered in what is today Bulgaria date from at least 1.4 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20141225190811/http://www.academia.edu/400095/Sirakov_et_al._2010_.-_An_ancient_continuous_human_presence_in_the_Balkans_and_the_beginnings_of_human_settlement_in_western_Eurasia_A_Lower_Pleistocene_example_of_the_Lower_Palaeolithic_levels_in_Kozarnika_cave_North-western_Bulgaria_]&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5000 BC, a sophisticated civilization already existed which produced some of the first pottery, jewellery and golden artifacts in the world. After 3000 BC, the [[Thracians]] appeared on the Balkan peninsula. In the late 6th century BC, most of what is nowadays Bulgaria came under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA345 &quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4443-5163-7}} pp 135–138, pp 343–345&lt;/ref&gt; In the 470s BC, the Thracians formed the powerful [[Odrysian Kingdom]] which lasted until 46 BC, when it was finally conquered by the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oKx4FyAOOQC&amp;pg=PA221|title=The Expedition of Cyrus|isbn=9780191605048|access-date=24 December 2014|author1=Xenophon|date=8 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the centuries, some Thracian tribes fell under [[Macedonian Empire|Ancient Macedonian]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], and also [[Celts|Celtic]] domination. This mixture of ancient peoples was assimilated by the [[Slavs]], who permanently settled on the peninsula after 500 AD.

Meanwhile, in 632 the [[Bulgars]] formed an independent state north of the [[Black sea]] that became known as [[Great Bulgaria]] under the leadership of [[Kubrat]]. Pressure from the [[Khazars]] led to the disintegration of Great Bulgaria in the second half of the 7th century. One of [[Kubrat]]'s successors, [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], migrated with some of the Bulgar tribes to the area around the [[Danube delta]], and subsequently conquered [[Scythia Minor]] and [[Moesia Inferior]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 and the establishment of a permanent Bulgarian capital at [[Pliska]] south of the Danube mark the beginning of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. The new state brought together Thracian remnants and Slavs under Bulgar rule, and a slow process of mutual assimilation began. In the following centuries Bulgaria established itself as a powerful empire, dominating the Balkans through its aggressive military traditions, which led to development of a distinct ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0013) Bulgaria - Introduction], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; Its ethnically and culturally diverse people united under a common religion, language and alphabet which formed and preserved the Bulgarian national consciousness despite foreign invasions and influences.

In the 11th century, the First Bulgarian Empire collapsed under [[Rus' people|Rus']] and Byzantine attacks, and became part of the Byzantine Empire until 1185. Then, a [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|major uprising]] led by two brothers, Asen and Peter of the [[Asen dynasty]], restored the Bulgarian state to form the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. After reaching its apogee in the 1230s, Bulgaria started to decline due to a number of factors, most notably its geographic position which rendered it vulnerable to simultaneous attacks and invasions from many sides. A peasant rebellion, one of the few successful such in history, established the swineherd [[Ivaylo of Bulgaria|Ivaylo]] as a Tsar. His short reign was essential in recovering—at least partially—the integrity of the Bulgarian state. A relatively thriving period followed after 1300, but ended in 1371, when factional divisions caused Bulgaria to split into three small Tsardoms. By 1396, they were subjugated by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Turks eliminated the Bulgarian system of nobility and ruling clergy, and Bulgaria remained [[Ottoman Bulgaria|an integral Turkish territory]] for the next 500 years.

With the decline of the Ottoman Empire after 1700, signs of revival started to emerge. The Bulgarian nobility had vanished, leaving an egalitarian peasant society with a small but growing urban middle class. By the 19th century, the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] became a key component of the struggle for independence, which would culminate in the failed [[April uprising]] in 1876, which prompted the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] and the subsequent [[Liberation of Bulgaria]]. The initial [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was rejected by the Western Great Powers, and the following Treaty of Berlin limited Bulgaria's territories to [[Moesia]] and the region of Sofia. This left many ethnic Bulgarians out of the borders of the new state, which defined Bulgaria's militaristic approach to regional affairs and its allegiance to Germany in both World Wars.

After World War II, Bulgaria became a [[Communist state]], with [[Todor Zhivkov]] serving as General Secretary of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] for a period of 35 years, sparking rapid economic development, increased life expectancies, and a heavier focus on industry. Bulgaria's economic advancement during the era came to an end in the 1980s, and the collapse of the Communist system in Eastern Europe marked a turning point for the country's development. A series of crises in the 1990s left much of Bulgaria's industry and agriculture in shambles, although a period of relative stabilization began with the election of [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] as prime minister in 2001. Bulgaria joined [[NATO]] in 2004 and the [[European Union]] in 2007.

[[Image:Or de Varna - Nécropole.jpg|thumb|A burial at Varna, with some of the world's oldest gold jewellery, dating back to 4,600 - 4,200 BC.]]
The earliest human remains found in Bulgaria were excavated in the [[Kozarnika]] cave, with an approximate age of 1,6 million BC. This cave probably keeps the earliest evidence of human symbolic behaviour ever found. A fragmented pair of human jaws, which are 44,000 years old, were found in [[Bacho Kiro cave]], but it is disputed whether these early humans were in fact [[Homo sapiens]] or [[Neanderthals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=After Eden: The evolution of human domination |last=Sale |first=Kirkpatrick |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2006 |page=48 |isbn=0822339382 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2q9780EgEBEC&amp;pg=PA48 |access-date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Thracians===
{{Main|Thracians}}
[[File:Panagyurishte gold.jpg|thumb|250px|A golden [[rhyton]], one of the items in the [[Panagyurishte treasure]], dating from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC]]
The first people to leave lasting traces and cultural heritage throughout the Balkan region were the [[Thracians]]. Their origin remains obscure. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of [[Neolithic Europe|indigenous peoples]] and [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the [[Early Bronze Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoddinott, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Thracian craftsmen inherited the skills of the indigenous civilisations before them, especially in gold working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Lost Races|last=Noorbergen|first=Rene|publisher=Teach Services Inc.|year=2004|page=72|isbn=1-57258-267-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSBnYno2-1oC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thracians were generally disorganized, but had an advanced culture despite the lack of their own proper script, and gathered powerful military forces when their divided tribes formed unions under the pressure of external threats. They never achieved any form of unity beyond short, dynastic rules at the height of the Greek classical period. Similar to the [[Gauls]] and other [[Celt]]ic tribes, most Thracians are thought to have lived simply in small [[Thracian warfare#Fortifications|fortified villages]], usually on hilltops. Although the concept of an urban Center wasn't developed until the Roman period, various larger fortifications which also served as regional market centres were numerous. Yet, in general, despite Greek colonization in such areas as [[Byzantium]], [[Apollonia, Thrace|Apollonia]] and other cities, the Thracians avoided urban life. The first [[Greek colonies]] in Thrace were founded in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth. ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary''. Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 1515. &quot;From the 8th century BC the coast Thrace was colonised by Greeks.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Thracian tribes remained divided and most of them fell under nominal Persian rule from the late 6th century till the first half of the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;q=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&amp;pg=PA345|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|isbn=9781444351637|access-date=17 December 2014|last1=Roisman|first1=Joseph|last2=Worthington|first2=Ian|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until King [[Teres I|Teres]] united most of them in the [[Odrysian kingdom]] around 470 BC, probably after the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Persian defeat in Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Waterfield.

At the commencement of the [[Peloponnesian war]] Sitalces entered into alliance with the [[Athenians]], and in 429 BC he invaded [[Macedon]] (then ruled by [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas II]]) with a vast army that included 150,000 warriors from independent Thracian tribes. Cotys I on the other hand, went to war with the Athenians for the possession of the [[Thracian Chersonese]]. Thereafter the [[Macedonian Empire]] incorporated the Odrysian kingdom&lt;ref&gt;

===Achaemenid Persian rule===

===The Celts===

[[File:Silver cauldron.jpg|thumb|The Gundestrup cauldron, today in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]]]
In 298 BC, [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes reached what is today Bulgaria and clashed with the forces of Macedonian king [[Cassander]] in Mount Haemos ([[Stara Planina]]). The Macedonians won the battle, but this did not stop the Celtic advancement. Many Thracian communities, weakened by the Macedonian occupation, fell under Celtic dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Celts: A History |last=Ó hÓgáin |first=Dáithí|year=2002 |publisher=The Collins Press |location=Cork |isbn=0-85115-923-0 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yd1huHoXJwC&amp;pg=PA50 |access-date=8 November 2011|quote=This, however, had little effect on the Celts, who within some years reached as far as Bulgaria.

Many placenames of that area in ancient times bear witness to the presence of Celtic strongholds&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 279 BC, one of the Celtic armies, led by Comontorius, attacked Thrace and succeeded in conquering it. Comontorius established the kingdom of [[Tylis]] in what is now eastern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Celtic culture&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Celtic culture: A historical encyclopedia |last=Koch |first=John T. |year=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=1-85109-440-7 |page= 156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA15 |access-date=8 November 2011|quote=Their influence in Thrace (roughly modern Bulgaria and European Turkey) is very modest, with only occasional samples of armour and jewellery, but they established a kingdom known as Tylis (alternatively Tyle) on the Thracian coast of the Black Sea.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern-day village of Tulovo bears the name of this relatively short-lived kingdom.

Patton attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former [[Nazi Party]] members continued to hold political posts in the region.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163–164}} When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] in noting that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165–166}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=16}} On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, &quot;All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army.&quot;{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165–166}}

Patton's final assignment was to command the [[U.S. 15th Army]], based in [[Bad Nauheim]]. The 15th Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff working to compile a history of the war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest. He began traveling, visiting Paris, [[Rennes]], [[Chartres]], [[Brussels]], [[Metz]], [[Reims]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Verdun]]. Then he went to [[Stockholm]], where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165–166}} Patton decided that he would leave his post at the 15th Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for [[Christmas]] leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire from the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}

=== Accident and death ===
[[File:General Patton's grave 300806.jpg|thumb|Patton's grave in [[Luxembourg City]]]]
On December 8, 1945, Patton's chief of staff, Major General [[Hobart R. Gay|Hobart Gay]], invited him on a [[pheasant]] hunting trip near [[Speyer]] to lift his spirits. Observing derelict cars along the side of the road, Patton said, &quot;How awful war is. Think of the waste.&quot; Moments later his car collided with an American army truck at low speed.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826–827}}

Gay and others were only slightly injured, but Patton hit his head on the glass partition in the back seat. He began bleeding from a gash to the head, and complained that he was paralyzed and having trouble breathing. Taken to a hospital in [[Heidelberg]], Patton was discovered to have a [[compression fracture]] and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth [[vertebra]]e, resulting in a broken neck and [[cervical spinal cord]] injury that rendered him [[quadriplegia|paralyzed from the neck down]].{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826–827}}

Patton spent most of the next 12 days in [[traction (orthopedics)#Spinal decompression|spinal traction]] to decrease the pressure on his spine. All nonmedical visitors, except for Patton's wife, who had flown from the U.S., were forbidden. Patton, who had been told he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life, at one point commented, &quot;This is a hell of a way to die.&quot; He died in his sleep of [[pulmonary edema]] and [[congestive heart failure]] at about 6:00{{nbsp}}pm on December 21, 1945.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=168–169}}

Patton was buried at the [[Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial]] in the [[Hamm, Luxembourg|Hamm district]] of [[Luxembourg City]], alongside some wartime casualties of the Third Army, in accordance with his request to, &quot;be buried with [his] men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials |publisher=[[American Battle Monuments Commission]] |title=Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General Patton 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|right|General Patton U.S. commemorative stamp, issued in 1953]]
According to [[Martin Blumenson]]:
:Patton epitomized the fighting soldier in World War II. He exercised unique leadership by his ability to obtain the utmost--some would say more than the maximum--response from American combat troops. Through his charisma, exemplified by a flamboyant and well-publicized image, he stimulated, better than any other high-ranking U.S. army commander, American troops to an aggressive desire to close with and destroy the enemy. He personified the offensive spirit, the ruthless drive, and the will for victory in battle....As the outstanding exponent of combat effectiveness, particularly with respect to the employment of armored forces--that is, the combined use of tanks, motorized infantry, and self-propelled artillery, closely supported by tactical aircraft--Patton brought the blitzkrieg concept to perfection.&lt;ref&gt; Martin Blumenson, “Patton, George Smith” in John Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) p 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton's colorful personality, hard-driving leadership style, and success as a commander, combined with his frequent political missteps, produced a mixed and often contradictory image. Patton's great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=ix}} Historian [[Terry Brighton]] concluded that Patton was &quot;arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but&amp;nbsp;... among the greatest generals of the war&quot;.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xv}} Patton's impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial, with the [[U.S. Army]]'s adopting many of Patton's aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death. Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy. The first American tank designed after the war became the [[M46 Patton]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=viii}}

Several actors have portrayed Patton on screen, the most famous being [[George C. Scott]] in the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. Scott's iconic depiction of Patton earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and it was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture as a [[folk hero]].{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=1}} He would reprise the role in 1986 in the made-for-television film ''[[The Last Days of Patton]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;/&gt; Other actors who have portrayed Patton include [[Stephen McNally]] in the 1957 episode &quot;The Patton Prayer&quot; of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] religion [[anthology series]], ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', [[John Larch]] in the 1963 film ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]'', [[Kirk Douglas]] in the 1966 film ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'', [[George Kennedy]] in the 1978 film ''[[Brass Target]]'', [[Darren McGavin]] in the 1979 miniseries [[Ike (TV miniseries)|''Ike'']], Robert Prentiss in the 1988 film ''[[Pancho Barnes (1988 film)|Pancho Barnes]]'', [[Mitchell Ryan]] in the 1989 film ''[[Double Exposure: The Story of Margaret Bourke-White]]'', [[Lawrence Dobkin]] in a 1989 episode of the miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance (TV miniseries)|War and Remembrance]]'', [[Edward Asner]] in the 1997 film ''[[The Long Way Home (1997 film)|The Long Way Home]]'', [[Gerald McRaney]] in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]'', [[Dan Higgins]] in a 2006 episode of the miniseries ''[[Man, Moment, Machine]]'', and [[Kelsey Grammer]] in the 2008 film ''[[An American Carol]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028822/ |title=George S. Patton |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|George S. Patton's speech to the Third Army}}

Patton cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that this would inspire his troops. He carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, silver-plated [[Colt Single Action Army]] .45 caliber revolver on his right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 27]] .357 Magnum on his left hip.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvi}} He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots.{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=478}} Patton also cultivated a stern expression he called his &quot;war face&quot;.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=110}} He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white and blue. His [[jeep]] bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps, featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; the proposal was derided in the media as &quot;the Green Hornet&quot;, and it was rejected by the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77–79}}

The historian [[Alan Axelrod]] wrote that &quot;for Patton, leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders, it was about transforming oneself into a symbol&quot;.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80–82}} Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. He was an admirer of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] for his actions in leading the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in a full dress uniform.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80–82}} Patton had a preoccupation with bravery,{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=14–15}} wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat, and at one point during World War II, he rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=54–55}}

Patton was a staunch [[fatalist]],{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} and he believed in [[reincarnation]]. He believed that he might have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army or a [[Roman legionary]] in a previous life.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|pp=36–37}}

Patton developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=67–68}} He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command, but it offended other generals, including Bradley.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=578}} The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=130–131}} When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, &quot;The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored [[halftrack]] and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers. &quot;{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151–168}} During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should &quot;let the sons-of-bitches [Germans] go all the way to Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up.&quot;{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151–168}} He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could &quot;drive the British back into the sea for another [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].&quot;{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151–168}}

As media scrutiny on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that he was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=111}} His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=113}} Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at [[Knutsford]] in England, and said, in part, &quot;since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do.&quot; The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p= 114}}

On a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them &quot;the real heroes&quot; of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163–164}} His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said &quot;[d]enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time.&quot; This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=117}}
[[File:Patton's .357 revolver.jpg|thumb|left|Patton's well-known custom ivory-handled revolver]]
As a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77–79}} Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, [[Orlando Ward]], and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=467–468}} Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded.{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.{{sfn|Wallace|1946|p=97}}

=== Views on race ===
Patton's views on race were complicated and controversial. This may have resulted from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the [[Confederate States of America|southern United States]].{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=18}} Privately he wrote of black soldiers: &lt;blockquote&gt;Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor.{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=60}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a Nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him.{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=864}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Addressing the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st Tank Battalion]] Patton also said, &lt;blockquote&gt;Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=726}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;Likewise, Patton called heavily on the Black troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into the same rifle companies.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p= 726}}

=== Views on the Arab world ===
After reading the [[Koran]] and observing [[North Africa]]ns, he wrote to his wife, &quot;Just finished reading the Koran—a good book and interesting.&quot; Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture; he once rated the progress of word-of-mouth rumor in [[Arab]] country at {{convert|40|–|60|mi}} a day. In spite of his regard for the Koran, he concluded, &lt;blockquote&gt;To me it seems certain that the [[fatalistic]] teachings of [[Mohammad]] and the utter degradation of women is the outstanding cause for the arrested development of the Arab&amp;nbsp;... Here, I think, is a text for some eloquent sermon on the virtues of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Views on Russians ===
Patton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of [[Russians]], saying &lt;blockquote&gt;I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=739}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Antisemitic views ===

Patton expressed growing feelings of antisemitism.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165–166}} In his journal, Patton referred to the Jewish survivors in [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|displaced persons camps]] which he oversaw, as &quot;the greatest stinking mass of humanity&quot;, &quot;lower than animals&quot;: &quot;Of course, I have seen them since the beginning and marveled that beings alleged to be made in the form of God can look the way they do or act the way they act.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|date=2015-02-07|title=Surviving the Nazis, Only to Be Jailed by America (Published 2015)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/sunday-review/surviving-the-nazis-only-to-be-jailed-by-america.html|access-date=2020-10-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As viewed by Allied leaders ===
[[File:Patton Monument West Point in new location 2009 upright.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Patton at the US Military Academy at [[West Point]]]]
On February 1, 1945, Eisenhower wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of his subordinate American generals in Europe. General Bradley and the [[Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Spaatz]] shared the number one position, [[Walter Bedell Smith]] was ranked number three, and Patton number four.{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=801}} Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book ''Patton and His Third Army'': &quot;George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an Army in the open field that our or any other service produced. But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign.&quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}} Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely &quot;a brilliant executor&quot;.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}

Notwithstanding Eisenhower's estimation of Patton's abilities as a strategic planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe is revealed in his refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, &quot;Patton is indispensable to the war effort—one of the guarantors of our victory.&quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=536}} As [[Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] told Eisenhower: &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s remark after they got after [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] comes to mind when I think of Patton—'I can't spare this man, he fights'.&quot;{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=442}} After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: &lt;blockquote&gt;He was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader&amp;nbsp;... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Historian [[Carlo D'Este]] insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=466–467}}{{sfn|D'Este|2002|pp=403–404}} but Bradley's biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise.{{sfn|DeFelice|2011|p=402}} President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities, stating &quot;he is our greatest fighting general, and sheer joy&quot;.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}} On the other hand, Roosevelt's successor, [[Harry S. Truman]], appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton, at one point comparing both him and [[Douglas MacArthur]] to [[George Armstrong Custer]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}}

For the most part, British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS)—the professional head of the British Army—noted in January 1943 that &lt;blockquote&gt;I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild, and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push, but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=451}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;One possible exception was [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] who appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=549}} Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the [[Free France|Free French]] in particular. General [[Henri Giraud]] was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|French President]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=801}} Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was apparently an admirer, stating that the [[Red Army]] could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France.{{Sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=562}}

=== As viewed by Axis leaders ===
[[File:2011-01-6 Baugnez laarzen van George Patton 6-01-2012 14-09-34.JPG|thumb|Patton's boots at a museum in [[Malmedy]]]]

While Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted to have more respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} [[Adolf Hitler]] reportedly called him &quot;that crazy cowboy general&quot;.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war,{{refn|Among the opinions of Patton's abilities, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' Horst Freiherr von Wangenheim, operations officer of the [[277th Volksgrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|277th Volksgrenadier Division]], stated that &quot;General Patton is the most feared general on all fronts. [His] tactics are daring and unpredictable&amp;nbsp;.... He is the most modern general and the best commander of [combined] armored and infantry forces.&quot;{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|pp=480–483}} ''General der Panzertruppen'' [[Hasso von Manteuffel]], who had fought both Soviet and Anglo-American tank commanders, agreed: &quot;Patton! No doubt about this. He was a brilliant Panzer army commander.&quot;{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}}|group=Note}} and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. [[Erwin Rommel]] credited Patton with executing &quot;the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare&quot;.{{Sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvii}} ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alfred Jodl]], chief of staff of the German Army, stated that Patton &quot;was the American [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]]. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes.&quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]] said that &lt;blockquote&gt;Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]], [[Fritz Bayerlein]] opined that &quot;I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily.&quot;{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} In an interview conducted for ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' just after his capture, Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] stated simply of Patton, &quot;He is your best.&quot;{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=1}}

'''John Herbert Dillinger''' (June 22, 1903&amp;nbsp;– July 22, 1934) was an American gangster of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He led a group known as the &quot;[[Dillinger Gang]]&quot; which was accused of robbing 24 banks and 4 police stations.  Dillinger escaped from jail twice. He was charged but not convicted of the murder of an [[East Chicago, Indiana]], police officer who shot Dillinger in his [[bullet-proof vest]] during a [[shootout]]. It was the only time Dillinger was charged with homicide.

Dillinger courted publicity.  The media ran exaggerated accounts of his bravado colorful personality and cast him as a [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Dean|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/on-the-trail-of-john-dillinger/|title=On the trail of John Dillinger|website=CBS News|access-date=28 June 2018|date=21 June 2009}} &quot;Middle Americans were so angry at the bankers and businessmen who had taken their money, their homes, their jobs, hundreds of thousands of Middle Americans especially were cheering on Dillinger,&quot; said [[Bryan Burrough]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/americas-own-robin-hood-the-dillinger-legend-ljr06mj88z8|title=America's own Robin Hood The Dillinger legend|newspaper=The Sunday Times|access-date=28 June 2018|date=28 June 2009|last=Goodwin|first=Christopher|quote=Dillinger's audacious string of robberies and prison escapes in the early 1930s turned him into an American folk hero, a Depression-era Robin Hood. He and his gang robbed more than a dozen banks between May 1933 and July 1934, stealing more than $300,000, the equivalent of more than $5m today. He also destroyed thousands of mortgage records during the robberies, helping many poor people escape onerous payments to rapacious banks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then director of the [[Bureau of Investigation]] (BOI), used Dillinger and his gang as his campaign platform to evolve the BOI into the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], developing more sophisticated investigative techniques as weapons against [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''Dillinger's Wild Ride: The Year That Made America's Public Enemy Number One'' (2009), p 101.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After evading police in four states for almost a year, Dillinger was wounded and went to his father's home to mend. He returned to Chicago in July 1934 and sought refuge in a [[brothel]] owned by [[Ana Cumpănaș]].  She informed authorities of his whereabouts. On July 22, 1934, the police and [[G-man|G-men]]&lt;ref name=fbihist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2006/march/fbiname_022406|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|title=A Byte Out of History – How The FBI Got Its Name|accessdate=February 17, 2011|date=March 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; closed in on the [[Biograph Theater]]. Federal agents, led by [[Melvin Purvis]] and [[Samuel P. Cowley]], moved to arrest Dillinger as he exited the theater. He drew a gun while attempting to flee, but was killed. This was ruled as [[justifiable homicide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;J.J. Kearns' autopsy report&quot;&gt;J.J.

==Early life==
===Family and background===
John Dillinger was born on June 22, 1903 at 2053 Cooper Street (now Caroline Avenue), [[Indianapolis, Indiana| Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/john-dillinger|title=Famous Cases &amp; Criminals – John Dillinger|publisher=Fbi.gov|accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the younger of two children born to John Wilson Dillinger (1864–1943) and Mary Ellen &quot;Mollie&quot; Lancaster (1870–1907).&lt;ref name=matera&gt;{{cite book|title=John Dillinger: The Life and Death of America's First Celebrity Criminal|author=Matera, Dary|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|year=2005|isbn=0-7867-1558-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

According to some biographers, his German grandfather, Matthias Dillinger, immigrated to the United States in 1851 from [[Metz]], in the region of [[Moselle (department)|Lorraine]], then still under [[French Second Republic|French sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germerica.net/tolzmann-dillinger-germerica|title=Was John Dillinger German?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101211957/http://germerica.net/tolzmann-dillinger-germerica|date=July 9, 2009|archive-date=January 1, 2011|last=Tolzmann|first=Dr. Don Heinrich|via=[[Internet Archive]]|website=Germerica}} citing ''The Untold Story'' by G. Russell Giradin and William J. Helmer; and Dary Matera's ''John Dillinger''.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Matthias Dillinger was born in [[Wallerfangen|Gisingen]], near [[Dillingen, Saarland|Dillingen]] in the present-day German state of [[Saarland]]. John Dillinger's parents had married on August 23, 1887. Dillinger's father was a grocer by trade and, reportedly, a harsh man.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|9}} In an interview with reporters, Dillinger said that he was firm in his discipline and believed in the adage &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Dillinger's older sister, Audrey, was born March 6, 1889. Their mother died in 1907 just before his fourth birthday.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/dillinger/dillinger.htm |title=Famous Cases: John Dillinger |accessdate=2009-06-26 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919030546/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/dillinger/dillinger.htm |archivedate=2009-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Audrey married Emmett &quot;Fred&quot; Hancock that year and they had seven children together. She cared for her brother John for several years until their father remarried in 1912 to Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Fields (1878–1933). They had three children, Hubert M. Dillinger (1913–1974) Doris M. Dillinger Hockman (1918–2001) and Frances Dillinger Thompson (1922–2015).&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/27856998/depression-era-gangster-john-dillingers-sister-dies-in-mooresville-at-92|title=Depression-era gangster John Dillinger's sister dies in Mooresville at 92|website=[[WTHR]]|date=January 15, 2015|author=WTHR.com Staff|access-date=January 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119023231/http://www.wthr.com/story/27856998/depression-era-gangster-john-dillingers-sister-dies-in-mooresville-at-92|archive-date=January 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formative years and marriage===
As a teenager, Dillinger was frequently in trouble with the law for fighting and petty theft; he was also noted for his &quot;bewildering personality&quot; and [[bullying]] of smaller children.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|14}} He quit school to work in an Indianapolis machine shop. His father feared that the city was corrupting his son, prompting him to move the family to [[Mooresville, Indiana]], in 1921.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|15}} Dillinger's wild and rebellious behavior was unchanged, despite his new rural life. In 1922, he was arrested for [[Motor vehicle theft|auto theft]], and his relationship with his father deteriorated.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

In 1923, Dillinger's troubles led to him enlisting in the [[United States Navy]], where he was a [[Petty officer third class]] Machinery Repairman assigned aboard the battleship {{USS|Utah|BB-31|6}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&amp;type=AssignmentExt&amp;ID=1660265|title=Shadow box|website=navy.togetherweserved.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he [[Desertion|deserted]] a few months later when his ship was docked in [[Boston]]. He was eventually [[dishonorably discharge]]d some months later.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|18–20}}

Dillinger then returned to Mooresville where he met Beryl Ethel Hovious.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;&gt;&quot;Certificate of Birth: Beryl Hovious&quot; Morgan County Health Department, [[Martinsville, Indiana]]. Filed 9-1923.&lt;/ref&gt; The two were married on April 12, 1924. He attempted to settle down, but he had difficulty holding a job and preserving his marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; Unable to find a job, he began planning a robbery with his friend Ed Singleton,&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|22}} who was an ex-convict and umpire for the semi-professional baseball team, the AC Athletics, for which Dillinger played shortstop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landers |first1=Chris |title=Dillinger played ball before he robbed banks |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/bank-robber-john-dillinger-played-baseball |website=MLB |publisher=MLB Advanced Media |accessdate=26 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200426125200/https://www.mlb.com/news/bank-robber-john-dillinger-played-baseball |archivedate=26 April 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two robbed a local grocery store, stealing $50.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|26}} While leaving the scene, the criminals were spotted by a minister who recognized the men and reported them to the police. During the robbery, Dillinger had struck a victim on the head with a machine bolt wrapped in a cloth and had also carried a gun which, although it discharged, hit no one. The two men were arrested the next day. Singleton pleaded not guilty, but after Dillinger's father (the local Mooresville Church deacon) discussed the matter with Morgan County prosecutor Omar O'Harrow, his father convinced Dillinger to confess to the crime and plead guilty without retaining a defense attorney.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Dillinger was convicted of [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] with intent to rob, and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit a [[felony]].

==Prison time==
Within [[Indiana Reformatory]] and [[Indiana State Prison]], from 1924 to 1933, Dillinger began to become embroiled in a criminal lifestyle. Upon being admitted to the prison, he is quoted as saying, &quot;I will be the meanest bastard you ever saw when I get out of here.&quot;&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|26}} His physical examination upon being admitted to the prison showed that he had [[gonorrhea]]. The treatment for his condition was extremely painful.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|22}} He became embittered against society because of his long prison sentence and befriended other criminals, such as seasoned bank robbers like [[Harry Pierpont|Harry &quot;Pete&quot; Pierpont]], [[Charles Makley]], [[Russell Clark (criminal)|Russell Clark]], and [[Homer Van Meter]], who taught Dillinger how to be a successful criminal. The men planned heists that they would commit soon after they were released.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|32}} Dillinger studied [[Herman Lamm]]'s meticulous bank-robbing system and used it extensively throughout his criminal career.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

His father launched a campaign to have him released and was able to obtain 188 signatures on a petition. Dillinger was [[parole]]d on May 10, 1933, after serving nine and a half years. Dillinger's stepmother became sick just before he was released from the prison, and died before he arrived at her home.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|37}} Released at the height of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Dillinger had little prospect of finding gainful employment.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|35}} He immediately returned to crime.&lt;ref name=matera/&gt;{{rp|39}}

On June 21, 1933, he robbed his first bank, taking $10,000 from the New Carlisle National Bank, which occupied the building at the southeast corner of Main Street and Jefferson (State Routes 235 and 571) in [[New Carlisle, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DDN-1933-06-21&quot;&gt;&quot;Bandits Bind Cashier, Clerk and Assistant&quot;, ''Dayton Daily News'', June 21, 1933, pp, 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, Dillinger robbed a bank in [[Bluffton, Ohio]]. Tracked by police from [[Dayton, Ohio]], he was captured and later transferred to the Allen County Jail in [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]] to be indicted in connection to the Bluffton robbery. After searching him before letting him into the prison, the police discovered a document which appeared to be a [[prison escape]] plan. They demanded Dillinger tell them what the document meant, but he refused.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

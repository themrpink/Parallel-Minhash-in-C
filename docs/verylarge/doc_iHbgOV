Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the [[urban heat island]] effect limits Phoenix's [[diurnal temperature variation]]. As the city has expanded, average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising. Pavement, sidewalks, and buildings store the sun's heat and radiate it at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Insider's Guide: Phoenix &amp; Scottsdale |publisher=Morris Book Publishing|editor-last=Sirois|editor-first=Kevin |isbn=978-0-7627-7321-3 |edition=7th |year=2012 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily normal low remains at or above {{convert|80|°F|0}} for an average of 67 days per summer.

July is the wettest month ({{convert|1.05|in|mm|abbr=on}}), while June is the driest ({{convert|0.02|in|mm|abbr=on}}). On September 8, 2014, the city of Phoenix recorded its single highest rainfall total by the National Weather Service with {{convert|3.30|in|mm|abbr=on}} breaking the 75-year-old record of {{convert|2.91|in|mm|abbr=on}}, set on September 4, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/wettest-day-record-phoenix-flooding-leaves-2-dead-n198201 |title=Wettest Day on Record in Phoenix, Flooding Leaves 2 Dead |publisher=NBC News |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023858/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/wettest-day-record-phoenix-flooding-leaves-2-dead-n198201 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The September 2014 storm was created from the remnants of Hurricane Norbert which had moved up from the [[Gulf of California]] and flooded the city's major interstates and low-lying roadways, stranding hundreds of motorists.&lt;ref name=&quot;BATTG19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2014/09/09/record-amount-rainfall-floods-phoenix-as-hurricane-norbert-remnants-soak/ |title=Record amount of rainfall floods Phoenix as Hurricane Norbert remnants soak Southwest |publisher=FOX News |access-date=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, dew points range from {{convert|29|°F|0}} in April to {{convert|57|°F|0}} in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/westcomp.dp.html |title=AVERAGE MONTHLY DEW POINT TEMPERATURE |publisher=westcomp.dp.html |access-date=March 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, dew points can drop as low as {{convert|0|°F|0}}, or they can rise as high as {{convert|70|°F|0}}, or higher, during periods of strong monsoon activity—creating muggy conditions in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://azclimate.asu.edu/climate/climate-of-phoenix-summary/ |title=Arizona State Climate Office: General Geographical and Climatological Summary |publisher=asu.edu | access-date=March 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BATTG19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tiggrweather.net/wxdewpointsummary.php/ |title=Phoenix Weather Forecasts and Current Conditions: Average Dew Point Summary |publisher=TiggrWeather.net | access-date=June 9, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During prolonged periods of parched and windy conditions, desert lands in and around the city are susceptible to [[wildfire]] outbreaks. Fire risk is highest in the spring and summer months following winters with above-average precipitation, due to the resulting carpet of invasive grass, weeds, and brush. Rugged terrain often makes firefighting efforts difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ktar.com/story/3228115/arizona-wildfire-season-is-already-ahead-of-previous-years-pace/ |title=Arizona wildfire season is already ahead of previous year’s pace |publisher=KTAR News |access-date=June 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the annual minimum temperature in Phoenix is in the mid-to-low 30s. It rarely drops to 32&amp;nbsp;°F (0&amp;nbsp;°C) or below, having done so in only seven of the years between 1995 and 2015 on a total of sixteen days.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;/&gt; However, peripheral portions of the greater [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] frequently see frost in the winter. The earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987. {{efn|Since Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) opened, the earliest and latest freezes recorded there are November 3, 1946, and April 4, 1945, respectively. However, as the [http://threadex.rcc-acis.org/ official Phoenix climatology station] was changed to PHX in October 1953, those records are not considered official.}} The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was {{convert|16|°F|0}} on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature ever recorded was {{convert|36|°F|0}} on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979, to January 31, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ag.arizona.edu/maricopa/garden/html/weather/frost.htm |title=Frost in the Valley of the Sun |publisher=The University of Arizona |access-date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/az1002.pdf |title=Frost Protection |publisher=The University of Arizona |access-date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow is a rare occurrence in Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record took place on January 21–22, 1937, when {{convert|1|to|4|in|cm}} fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. On December 6, 1998, snow fell across the northwest portions of the city, and Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/psr/general/history/index.php?page=snow |title=A history of snow fall in Phoenix |publisher=NOAA |access-date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 2010, and February 20, 2013, [[graupel]] fell across much of the city, although it was widely believed to be snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haldiman |first=Philip |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2010/12/30/20101230phoenix-area-residents-report-snow-falling-valley.html |title=Phoenix-area residents report snow falling across Valley |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=December 30, 2010 |access-date=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720052218/http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2010/12/30/20101230phoenix-area-residents-report-snow-falling-valley.html |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, on February 21–22, 2019, the far northern and northeastern sections of the metro area were blanketed with several inches of snow while Sky Harbor received record rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ktar.com/story/2449524/snow-lands-really-sticks-in-phoenix-during-record-rainy-day/ |title=Snow lands, really sticks in far Phoenix area during record rainy day |publisher=ktar.com |date=February 22, 2019 |access-date=February 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
While some of the native flora and fauna of the [[Sonoran Desert]] can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include [[coyote]], [[Collared Peccary|javelina]], [[bobcat]], [[Cougar|mountain lion]], [[Sylvilagus audubonii|desert cottontail rabbit]], [[jackrabbit]], [[antelope ground squirrel]], [[mule deer]], [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]], [[coati]], and multiple species of bats, such as the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]] and [[western pipistrelle]], that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including [[Costa's hummingbird]], [[Anna's hummingbird]], [[Gambel's quail]], [[Gila woodpecker]], [[mourning dove]], [[white-winged dove]], the [[roadrunner]], the [[cactus wren]], and many species of raptors, including [[falcons]], [[hawks]], [[owls]], [[vultures]] (such as the [[turkey vulture]] and [[black vulture]]), and [[eagles]], including the [[golden eagle|golden]] and the [[bald eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/trails/things-to-do/wildlife |title=The Wildlife of the Phoenix Mountain Preserves |publisher=phoenix.gov |access-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919085511/https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/trails/things-to-do/wildlife |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_az_wildlife.shtml |title=Living With Wildlife&amp;nbsp;– Arizona Wildlife |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish Department |access-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011519/http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_az_wildlife.shtml |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of [[rosy-faced lovebird]]s in the U.S. This bird is a popular [[birdcage]] pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These [[lovebird]]s prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead [[palm tree]] fronds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://azfo.org/journal/Rosy-facedLovebird2011.html |title=Status of the Rosy-faced Lovebird in Phoenix, Arizona |first1=Kurt A. |last1=Radamaker |first2=Troy E. |last2=Corman |date=September 15, 2011 |work=Arizona Field Ornithologists |access-date=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PF-Lovebird&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Greg |title=Peach-faced Lovebird Range Expansion Data in Greater Phoenix, Arizona Area |url=http://mirror-pole.com/collpage/pf_loveb/pfl_1.htm |access-date=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the [[Crotalus atrox|Western diamondback rattlesnake]], [[Crotalus cerastes cercobombus|Sonoran sidewinder]], several other types of rattlesnakes, [[Micruroides|Sonoran coral snake]], dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the [[Sonoran gopher snake]] and the [[California kingsnake]]), the [[gila monster]], [[Sceloporus magister|desert spiny lizard]], several types of [[Teiidae|whiptail lizards]], the [[chuckwalla]], [[desert horned lizard]], [[western banded gecko]], [[Sonora mud turtle]], and the [[desert tortoise]]. Native amphibian species include the [[Scaphiopus couchii|Couch's spadefoot toad]], [[Chiricahua leopard frog]], and the [[Incilius alvarius|Sonoran desert toad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsnakeremoval.com/snakes-of-phoenix.php |title=Common Snakes of the Phoenix Area |publisher=Phoenix Snake Removal |access-date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the [[Arizona bark scorpion]], [[giant desert hairy scorpion]], [[Arizona blond tarantula]], [[Sonoran Desert centipede]], [[tarantula hawk wasp]], [[solifugae|camel spider]], and [[amblypygi|tailless whip scorpion]]. Of great concern is the presence of [[Africanized bee]]s which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.

The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has &quot;the most structurally diverse flora in the United States.&quot; One of the most well-known types of succulents, the [[Saguaro|giant saguaro cactus]], is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], [[Barrel cactus|barrel]], [[Fishhook cactus|fishhook]], [[Pachycereus schottii|senita]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] and [[Cylindropuntia|cholla]] cacti; [[Fouquieria|ocotillo]]; [[Parkinsonia aculeata|Palo Verde trees]] and [[Parkinsonia microphylla|foothill]] and [[Parkinsonia florida|blue paloverde]]; [[Washingtonia filifera|California fan palm]]; [[agave]]s; [[Yucca elata|soaptree yucca]], [[Hesperoyucca whipplei|Spanish bayonet]], [[Dasylirion wheeleri|desert spoon]], and [[Hesperaloe parviflora|red yucca]]; [[Olneya|ironwood]]; [[mesquite]]; and the [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/center/swbiodiversity.php |title=Sonoran Desert Region Flora&amp;nbsp;– Maricopa County |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum |access-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222050828/http://www.desertmuseum.org/center/swbiodiversity.php |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/azso/body.1_div.4.html |title=Natural Vegetation of Arizona |publisher=University of Arizona Library |access-date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix's population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% in 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as &quot;other races&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona&amp;nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same study says other religions (including [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism]]) collectively make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the area's religious composition was reported as 35% [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 22% to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestant]] denominations, 16% [[Latter-Day Saints]] (LDS), 14% to [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] congregations, 7% to [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations, and 2% [[Hindu]]. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism and Judaism.

While the number of religious adherents increased by 103,000 during the decade, the growth did not keep pace with the county's overall population increase of almost three-quarters of million individuals during the same period. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly or remain static. The Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/04/rcms2010_04013_county_tradition_2010.asp |title=2010 U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations &amp; Membership Study. |publisher=The Association of Religious Data Archives |access-date=March 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429154429/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/04/rcms2010_04013_county_tradition_2010.asp |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Phoenix, real estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new projects. Accordingly, the city is prone to overbuilding during times of economic prosperity. This explains the city's higher-than-average vacancy rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Some Investors Bid High on Phoenix Office Market|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-investors-bid-high-on-phoenix-office-market-1438703866|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 10, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Matt|last = Hudgins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine arts===
The downtown Phoenix art scene has developed in the past decade. The Artlink organization and the galleries downtown have launched a [[First Friday (public event)|First Friday]] cross-Phoenix gallery opening, as well as hosting Art Detour which has become central to the city's cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/arts/2018/03/11/art-detour-30-5-pioneers-who-built-downtown-phoenix-studio-scene/408866002/|title=Art Detour at 30: 5 pioneers who built the downtown Phoenix studio scene|website=azcentral|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, artist [[Janet Echelman]] inaugurated her monumental sculpture, ''[[Her Secret Is Patience]]'', a civic icon suspended above the new [[Phoenix Civic Space Park]], a two-city-block park in the middle of downtown. This netted sculpture makes the invisible patterns of desert wind visible to the human eye. During the day, the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall sculpture hovers high above heads, treetops, and buildings, the sculpture creates what the artist calls &quot;shadow drawings&quot;, which she says are inspired by Phoenix's cloud shadows. At night, the illumination changes color gradually through the seasons. Author Prof. Patrick Frank writes of the sculpture that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;most Arizonans look on the work with pride: this unique visual delight will forever mark the city of Phoenix just as the Eiffel Tower marks Paris.&quot;&lt;ref name='Prebles'&gt;{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Patrick |title=Prebles' ARTFORMS |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-79753-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cryosphere''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κρύος}} ''kryos'', &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;frost&quot; or &quot;ice&quot; and {{lang|grc|σφαῖρα}} ''sphaira'', &quot;globe, ball&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is an all-encompassing term for those portions of [[Earth]]'s surface where [[water]] is in [[solid]] form, including [[sea ice]], lake ice, river [[ice]], [[snow]] cover, [[glacier]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[ice sheet]]s, and frozen ground (which includes [[permafrost]]). Thus, there is a wide overlap with the [[hydrosphere]]. The cryosphere is an integral part of the [[global climate]] system with important linkages and [[feedback]]s generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, [[cloud]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[hydrology]], atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these [[feedback]] processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the [[global climate]] and in [[climate model]] response to global changes. The term [[deglaciation]] describes the retreat of cryospheric features. Cryology is the study of cryospheres.

[[File:Components of the Cryosphere.tif|thumb|300px|Extent of the regions affected by components of the cryosphere around the world from the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]]]]
[[Ice|Frozen water]] is found on the [[Earth]]’s surface primarily as [[snow]] cover, [[freshwater]] [[ice]] in [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, [[sea ice]], [[glaciers]], [[ice sheets]], and frozen ground and [[permafrost]] (permanently frozen ground). The residence time of water in each of these cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central [[Arctic]], lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in [[glaciers]], [[ice sheets]], or ground ice, however, may remain frozen for 10–100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of [[East Antarctica]] may have an age approaching 1 million years.

Most of the world's ice volume is in [[Antarctica]], principally in the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. In terms of areal extent, however, [[Northern Hemisphere]] winter snow and ice extent comprise the largest area, amounting to an average 23% of hemispheric surface area in January. The large areal extent and the important climatic roles of [[snow]] and [[ice]], related to their unique physical properties, indicate that the ability to observe and model snow and ice-cover extent, thickness, and [[Properties of water#Physics and chemistry|physical properties]] (radiative and thermal properties) is of particular significance for [[climate research]].

There are several fundamental physical properties of snow and ice that modulate energy exchanges between the surface and the [[atmosphere]]. The most important properties are the surface reflectance ([[albedo]]), the ability to transfer heat (thermal diffusivity), and the ability to change state ([[latent heat]]). These physical properties, together with surface roughness, [[emissivity]], and [[dielectric]] characteristics, have important implications for observing [[snow]] and [[ice]] from space. For example, surface roughness is often the dominant factor determining the strength of [[radar]] [[backscatter]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;hall&quot;&gt;Hall, D. K., 1996: Remote sensing applications to hydrology: imaging radar. Hydrological Sciences, 41, 609–624.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical properties such as [[crystal]] structure, density, length, and liquid water content are important factors affecting the transfers of heat and water and the scattering of [[microwave]] [[energy]].

The surface reflectance of incoming [[solar radiation]] is important for the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to incident solar radiation, commonly referred to as [[albedo]]. [[Climatologists]] are primarily interested in [[albedo]] integrated over the [[Shortwave radiation|shortwave]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (~300 to 3500&amp;nbsp;nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, [[albedo]] values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80–90%) except in the case of forests. The higher [[albedo]]s for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface [[reflectivity]] in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by [[cloud cover]]. (Planetary [[albedo]] is determined principally by [[cloud cover]], and by the small amount of total [[solar radiation]] received in high [[latitudes]] during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the [[Arctic Ocean]] so the [[albedo]] [[feedback]] associated with the large seasonal changes in [[sea-ice]] extent is greatly reduced. Groisman ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;groisman&quot; /&gt; observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the [[Earth]] [[Irradiance|radiative balance]] in the spring (April to May) period when incoming [[solar radiation]] was greatest over snow-covered areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;groisman&quot;&gt;Groisman, P. Ya, T. R. Karl, and R. W. Knight, 1994a: Observed impact of snow cover on the heat balance and the rise of continental spring temperatures. Science, 363, 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[thermal]] properties of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. [[Snow]] and [[ice]] have much lower [[thermal]] diffusivities than [[air]]. [[Thermal diffusivity]] is a measure of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. [[Snow]] and [[ice]] are many [[orders of magnitude]] less efficient at diffusing heat than [[air]]. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the [[hydrological cycle]]. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch&quot;&gt;Lynch-Stieglitz, M., 1994: The development and validation of a simple snow model for the GISS GCM. J. Climate, 7, 1842–1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[snow]] and [[ice]] act to insulate the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming in the spring and summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the [[latent heat]] of fusion, 3.34 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; J/kg at 0&amp;nbsp;°C). However, the strong static stability of the [[atmosphere]] over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen&quot;&gt;Cohen, J., and D. Rind, 1991: The effect of snow cover on the climate. J. Climate, 4, 689–706.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of the world such as [[Eurasia]], however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer [[monsoon]] circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;vernekar&quot;&gt;Vernekar, A. D., J. Zhou, and J. Shukla, 1995: The effect of Eurasian snow cover on the Indian monsoon. J. Climate, 8, 248–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation [[feedback]] over the southwestern [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutzler|first=David S.|last2=Preston|first2=Jessica W.|date=1997-09-01|title=Evidence for a relationship between spring snow cover in North America and summer rainfall in New Mexico|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=24|issue=17|pages=2207–2210|doi=10.1029/97gl02099|bibcode=1997GeoRL..24.2207G|issn=1944-8007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[snow]] cover in modulating the monsoon is just one example of a short-term cryosphere-climate [[feedback]] involving the land surface and the [[atmosphere]]. From Figure 1 it can be seen that there are numerous cryosphere-climate feedbacks in the [[global climate]] system. These operate over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales from local seasonal cooling of air temperatures to hemispheric-scale variations in [[ice sheet]]s over time-scales of thousands of years. The [[feedback]] mechanisms involved are often complex and incompletely understood. For example, Curry ''et al.'' (1995) showed that the so-called “simple” sea ice-albedo feedback involved complex interactions with lead fraction, melt ponds, ice thickness, snow cover, and sea-ice extent.

=== Snow ===
[[Snow]] cover has the second-largest areal extent of any component of the cryosphere, with a mean maximum areal extent of approximately 47 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Most of the Earth's snow-covered area (SCA) is located in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and [[Time|temporal]] variability is dominated by the seasonal cycle; [[Northern Hemisphere]] snow-cover extent ranges from 46.5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in January to 3.8 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;&gt;Robinson, D. A., K. F. Dewey, and R. R. Heim, 1993: Global snow cover monitoring: an update. Bull. Amer. Meteorol. Soc., 74, 1689–1696.&lt;/ref&gt; [[North America]]n winter SCA has exhibited an increasing trend over much of this century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ross D.|last2=Goodison|first2=Barry E.|last3=Brown|first3=Ross D.|last4=Goodison|first4=Barry E.|date=1996-06-01|title=Interannual Variability in Reconstructed Canadian Snow Cover, 1915–1992|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1299–1318|language=EN|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1996)009&lt;1299:ivircs&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1996JCli....9.1299B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PassAQAAMAAJ|title=Proceedings of the Annual Meeting - Eastern Snow Conference|last=Hughes|first=M.

Ya, and D. R. Easterling, 1994: Variability and trends of total precipitation and snowfall over the United States and Canada. J. Climate, 7, 184–205.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the available [[satellite]] data show that the hemispheric winter snow cover has exhibited little interannual variability over the 1972–1996 period, with a coefficient of variation (COV=s.d./mean) for January [[Northern Hemisphere]] [[snow]] cover of &lt; 0.04. According to Groisman ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;groisman&quot; /&gt; [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring snow cover should exhibit a decreasing trend to explain an observed increase in [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring [[air temperature]]s this century. Preliminary estimates of SCA from historical and reconstructed [[in situ]] snow-cover data suggest this is the case for [[Eurasia]], but not for [[North America]], where spring snow cover has remained close to current levels over most of this century.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;Brown, R. D., 1997: Historical variability in Northern Hemisphere spring snow covered area. Annals of Glaciology, 25, 340–346.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the close relationship observed between hemispheric air temperature and snow-cover extent over the period of [[satellite]] data (IPCC 1996), there is considerable interest in monitoring [[Northern Hemisphere]] snow-cover extent for detecting and monitoring [[climate change]].

[[Snow]] cover is an extremely important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal [[snowpack]]s in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal [[snowpack]]s in the [[Earth]]’s mountain ranges account for the major source of the runoff for stream flow and [[groundwater]] recharge over wide areas of the midlatitudes. For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the [[Colorado River]] basin originates as snowmelt. [[Snowmelt]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the Earth's mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Furthermore, over 40% of the world's protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique [[ecosystem]]s needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale [[feedback]]s to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in [[soil moisture]] and runoff to the [[ocean]]s.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;prinsenberg&quot;&gt;Prinsenberg, S. J. 1988: Ice-cover and ice-ridge contributions to the freshwater contents of Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin. Arctic, 41, 6–11.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon [[ablation]] of the [[sea-ice]] .

=== Sea ice ===
[[Sea ice]] covers much of the polar oceans and forms by freezing of sea water. [[Satellite]] data since the early 1970s reveal considerable seasonal, regional, and interannual variability in the [[sea-ice]] covers of both hemispheres. Seasonally, sea-ice extent in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] varies by a factor of 5, from a minimum of 3–4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in February to a maximum of 17–20 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;zwally&quot;&gt;Zwally, H. J., J. C. Comiso, C. L. Parkinson, W. J. Campbell, F. D. Carsey, and P. Gloersen, 1983: Antarctic Sea Ice, 1973–1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations. NASA SP-459, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C., 206 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gloersen&quot;/&gt; The seasonal variation is much less in the Northern Hemisphere where the confined nature and high latitudes of the [[Arctic Ocean]] result in a much larger perennial ice cover, and the surrounding land limits the equatorward extent of wintertime ice. Thus, the seasonal variability in [[Northern Hemisphere]] ice extent varies by only a factor of 2, from a minimum of 7–9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in September to a maximum of 14–16 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in March.&lt;ref name=&quot;gloersen&quot;&gt;Gloersen, P., W. J. Campbell, D. J. Cavalieri, J. C. Comiso, C. L. Parkinson, and H. J. Zwally, 1992: Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice, 1978–1987: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations and Analysis. NASA SP-511, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C., 290 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parkinson&quot;&gt;Parkinson, C. L., J. C. Comiso, H. J. Zwally, D. J. Cavalieri, P. Gloersen, and W. J. Campbell, 1987: Arctic Sea Ice, 1973–1976: Satellite Passive-Microwave Observations, NASA SP-489, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C., 296 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice cover exhibits much greater regional-scale interannual variability than it does hemispherical. For instance, in the region of the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and [[Japan]], maximum ice extent decreased from 1.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1983 to 0.85 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1984, a decrease of 35%, before rebounding the following year to 1.2 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gloersen&quot;/&gt; The regional fluctuations in both hemispheres are such that for any several-year period of the [[satellite]] record some regions exhibit decreasing ice coverage while others exhibit increasing ice cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkinson1995&quot;&gt;Parkinson, C. L., 1995: Recent sea-ice advances in Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and retreats in the Bellinshausen Sea. Annals of Glaciology, 21, 348–352.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall trend indicated in the passive microwave record from 1978 through mid-1995 shows that the extent of [[Arctic sea ice]] is decreasing 2.7% per decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;johannessen&quot;&gt;Johannessen, O. M., M. Miles, and E. Bjørgo, 1995: The Arctic’s shrinking sea ice. Nature, 376, 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work with the satellite passive-microwave data indicates that from late October 1978 through the end of 1996 the extent of [[Arctic]] [[sea ice]] decreased by 2.9% per decade while the extent of [[Antarctic]] [[sea ice]] increased by 1.3% per decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;cavalieri&quot;&gt;Cavalieri, D. J., P. Gloersen, C. L. Parkinson, J. C. Comiso, and H. J. Zwally, 1997: Observed hemispheric asymmetry in global sea ice changes. Science, 278, 1104–1106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change publication ''Climate change 2013: The Physical Science Basis'' stated that sea ice extent for the [[Northern Hemisphere]] showed a decrease of 3.8% ± 0.3% per decade from November 1978 to December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter04_FINAL.pdf|website=ipcc|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=16 June 2015|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake ice and river ice ===
[[Ice]] forms on [[river]]s and [[lake]]s in response to seasonal cooling. The sizes of the ice bodies involved are too small to exert anything other than localized climatic effects. However, the freeze-up/break-up processes respond to large-scale and local weather factors, such that considerable interannual variability exists in the dates of appearance and disappearance of the ice. Long series of lake-ice observations can serve as a proxy climate record, and the monitoring of freeze-up and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally-specific index of climatic perturbations. Information on river-ice conditions is less useful as a climatic proxy because ice formation is strongly dependent on river-flow regime, which is affected by precipitation, snow melt, and watershed runoff as well as being subject to human interference that directly modifies channel flow, or that indirectly affects the runoff via land-use practices.

[[Lake]] freeze-up depends on the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any [[inflow (hydrology)|inflow]], and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although some indication of the depth of shallow lakes in the [[Arctic]] can be obtained from airborne [[radar imagery]] during late winter (Sellman ''et al.'' 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.

=== Frozen ground and permafrost ===
Frozen ground (permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) occupies approximately 54 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the exposed land areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2003) and therefore has the largest areal extent of any component of the cryosphere. [[Permafrost]] (perennially frozen ground) may occur where mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) are less than −1 or −2&amp;nbsp;°C and is generally continuous where MAAT are less than −7&amp;nbsp;°C. In addition, its extent and thickness are affected by ground moisture content, [[vegetation]] cover, winter snow depth, and aspect. The global extent of permafrost is still not completely known, but it underlies approximately 20% of [[Northern Hemisphere]] land areas. Thicknesses exceed 600 m along the Arctic coast of northeastern Siberia and Alaska, but, toward the margins, permafrost becomes thinner and horizontally discontinuous. The marginal zones will be more immediately subject to any melting caused by a warming trend. Most of the presently existing permafrost formed during previous colder conditions and is therefore relic. However, permafrost may form under present-day polar climates where glaciers retreat or land emergence exposes unfrozen ground. Washburn (1973) concluded that most continuous permafrost is in balance with the present climate at its upper surface, but changes at the base depend on the present climate and geothermal heat flow; in contrast, most discontinuous permafrost is probably unstable or &quot;in such delicate equilibrium that the slightest climatic or surface change will have drastic disequilibrium effects&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;washburn&quot;&gt;Washburn, A. L., 1973: Periglacial processes and environments. Edward Arnold, London, 320 pp. p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Under warming conditions, the increasing depth of the summer [[active layer]] has significant impacts on the [[hydrologic]] and [[geomorphic]] regimes. Thawing and retreat of [[permafrost]] have been reported in the upper [[Mackenzie Valley]] and along the southern margin of its occurrence in [[Manitoba]], but such observations are not readily quantified and generalized. Based on average latitudinal gradients of air temperature, an average northward displacement of the southern [[permafrost]] boundary by 50-to-150&amp;nbsp;km could be expected, under equilibrium conditions, for a 1&amp;nbsp;°C warming.

Only a fraction of the permafrost zone consists of actual ground ice. The remainder (dry permafrost) is simply soil or rock at subfreezing temperatures. The ice volume is generally greatest in the uppermost permafrost layers and mainly comprises pore and segregated ice in [[Earth]] material. Measurements of bore-hole temperatures in permafrost can be used as indicators of net changes in temperature regime. Gold and Lachenbruch (1973) infer a 2–4&amp;nbsp;°C warming over 75 to 100 years at [[Cape Thompson]], [[Alaska]], where the upper 25% of the 400-m thick [[permafrost]] is unstable with respect to an equilibrium profile of temperature with depth (for the present mean annual surface temperature of −5&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Maritime climate|Maritime]] influences may have biased this estimate, however. At [[Prudhoe Bay]] similar data imply a 1.8&amp;nbsp;°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch ''et al.'' 1982). Further complications may be introduced by changes in snow-cover depths and the natural or artificial disturbance of the surface vegetation.

The potential rates of permafrost thawing have been established by Osterkamp (1984) to be two centuries or less for 25-meter-thick permafrost in the discontinuous zone of interior [[Alaska]], assuming warming from −0.4 to 0&amp;nbsp;°C in 3–4 years, followed by a further 2.6&amp;nbsp;°C rise. Although the response of permafrost (depth) to temperature change is typically a very slow process (Osterkamp 1984; Koster 1993), there is ample evidence for the fact that the [[active layer]] thickness quickly responds to a temperature change (Kane ''et al.'' 1991). Whether, under a warming or cooling scenario, global climate change will have a significant effect on the duration of frost-free periods in both regions with seasonally  and perennially frozen ground.

=== Glaciers and ice sheets ===
[[Ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s are flowing ice masses that rest on solid land. They are controlled by snow accumulation, surface and basal melt, calving into surrounding oceans or lakes and internal dynamics. The latter results from gravity-driven creep flow (&quot;[[Ice flow dynamics|glacial flow]]&quot;) within the ice body and sliding on the underlying land, which leads to thinning and horizontal spreading.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreveBlatter2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greve, R. |author2=Blatter, H. |year=2009|title=Dynamics of Ice Sheets and Glaciers|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03415-2|isbn=978-3-642-03414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any imbalance of this dynamic equilibrium between mass gain, loss and transport due to flow results in either growing or shrinking ice bodies.

Ice sheets are the greatest potential source of global freshwater, holding approximately 77% of the global total. This corresponds to 80 m of world sea-level equivalent, with [[Antarctica]] accounting for 90% of this. [[Greenland]] accounts for most of the remaining 10%, with other ice bodies and glaciers accounting for less than 0.5%. Because of their size in relation to annual rates of snow accumulation and melt, the residence time of water in ice sheets can extend to 100,000 or 1 million years. Consequently, any climatic perturbations produce slow responses, occurring over glacial and interglacial periods. Valley glaciers respond rapidly to climatic fluctuations with typical response times of 10–50 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;oerlemans&quot;&gt;Oerlemans, J., 1994: Quantifying global warming from the retreat of glaciers. Science, 264, 243–245.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the response of individual glaciers may be asynchronous to the same climatic forcing because of differences in glacier length, elevation, slope, and speed of motion. Oerlemans (1994) provided evidence of coherent global [[glacier retreat]] which could be explained by a linear warming trend of 0.66&amp;nbsp;°C per 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;oerlemans&quot;/&gt;

While glacier variations are likely to have minimal effects upon [[global climate]], their recession may have contributed one third to one half of the observed 20th Century rise in sea level (Meier 1984; IPCC 1996). Furthermore, it is extremely likely that such extensive glacier recession as is currently observed in the Western Cordillera of North America,&lt;ref name=&quot;pelto&quot;&gt;Pelto, M. S., 1996: Annual net balance of North Cascade Glaciers, 1984–94. J. Glaciology, 42, 3–9.&lt;/ref&gt; where runoff from glacierized basins is used for [[irrigation]] and [[hydropower]], involves significant hydrological and [[ecosystem]] impacts. Effective water-resource planning and impact mitigation in such areas depends upon developing a sophisticated knowledge of the status of glacier ice and the mechanisms that cause it to change. Furthermore, a clear understanding of the mechanisms at work is crucial to interpreting the global-change signals that are contained in the time series of [[glacier mass balance]] records.

Combined [[glacier mass balance]] estimates of the large ice sheets carry an uncertainty of about 20%. Studies based on estimated snowfall and mass output tend to indicate that the ice sheets are near balance or taking some water out of the oceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;bentley&quot;&gt;Bentley, C. R., and M. B. Giovinetto, 1991: Mass balance of Antarctica and sea level change. In: G. Weller, C. L. Wilson and B. A. B. Severin (eds.), Polar regions and climate change. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, p. 481-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Marinebased studies &lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs&quot;&gt;Jacobs, S. S., H. H. Helmer, C. S. M. Doake, A. Jenkins, and R. M. Frohlich, 1992: Melting of ice shelves and the mass balance of Antarctica. J. Glaciology, 38, 375–387.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest [[sea level rise]] from the Antarctic or rapid ice-shelf basal melting. Some authors (Paterson 1993; Alley 1997) have suggested that the difference between the observed rate of sea-level rise (roughly 2&amp;nbsp;mm/y) and the explained rate of sea-level rise from melting of mountain glaciers, thermal expansion of the ocean, etc. (roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm/y or less) is similar to the modeled imbalance in the [[Antarctic]] (roughly 1&amp;nbsp;mm/y of sea-level rise; Huybrechts 1990), suggesting a contribution of sea-level rise from the Antarctic.

Relationships between global climate and changes in ice extent are complex. The mass balance of land-based glaciers and ice sheets is determined by the accumulation of snow, mostly in winter, and warm-season [[ablation]] due primarily to net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes to melting ice and snow from warm-air advection,&lt;ref name=&quot;paterson&quot;&gt;

Van den Broeke, M. R., 1996: The atmospheric boundary layer over ice sheets and glaciers. Utrecht, Universitiet Utrecht, 178 pp..&lt;/ref&gt;(Munro 1990). However, most of [[Antarctica]] never experiences surface melting.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandenbroeke2&quot;&gt;Van den Broeke, M. R., and R. Bintanja, 1995: The interaction of katabatic wind and the formation of blue ice areas in East Antarctica. J. Glaciology, 41, 395–407&lt;/ref&gt; Where ice masses terminate in the [[ocean]], iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] is the major contributor to mass loss. In this situation, the ice margin may extend out into deep water as a floating [[ice shelf]], such as that in the [[Ross Sea]]. Despite the possibility that global warming could result in losses to the [[Greenland ice sheet]] being offset by gains to the [[Antarctic ice sheet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ohmura&quot;&gt;Ohmura, A., M. Wild, and L. Bengtsson, 1996: A possible change in mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in the coming century. J. Climate, 9, 2124–2135.&lt;/ref&gt; there is major concern about the possibility of a [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] collapse. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level, and its collapse has the potential of raising the world sea level 6–7 m over a few hundred years.

Most of the discharge of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Rutford Ice Stream]] entering [[Ronne-Filchner shelf]] of the [[Weddell Sea]], and the Thwaites Glacier and [[Pine Island Glacier]] entering the [[Amundsen Ice Shelf]]. Opinions differ as to the present mass balance of these systems (Bentley 1983, 1985), principally because of the limited data. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is stable so long as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] is constrained by drag along its lateral boundaries and pinned by local grounding.

==Science==
&quot;Cryospheric sciences&quot; is an [[umbrella term]] for the study of the cryosphere (not unlike [[atmospheric sciences]], encompassing [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[aeronomy]]). As an interdisciplinary [[Earth science]], many disciplines contribute to it, most notably [[geology]], [[hydrology]], and [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]]; in this sense, it is comparable to [[glaciology]].

'''Cumulonimbus''' (from [[Latin]] ''cumulus'', &quot;heaped&quot; and ''nimbus'', &quot;rainstorm&quot;) is a dense, towering vertical [[cloud]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cumulonimbus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Cumulonimbus, International Cloud Atlas |volume=I |year=1975 |url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/48 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/48 48–50] |isbn=92-63-10407-7 |accessdate=28 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming from [[water vapor]] carried by powerful upward air currents. If observed during a storm, these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads. Cumulonimbus can form alone, in clusters, or along [[Squall line|cold front squall line]]s. These clouds are capable of producing [[lightning]] and other dangerous [[severe weather]], such as [[tornado]]es and hailstones. Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped [[cumulus congestus cloud]]s and may further develop as part of a [[supercell]]. Cumulonimbus is abbreviated '''Cb'''.

== Appearance ==
Towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds. The cumulonimbus base may extend several kilometres across and occupy low to middle altitudes - formed at altitude from approximately {{convert|200|to|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. Peaks typically reach to as much as {{convert|12000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with extreme instances as high as {{convert|21000|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints2/536/ |title=Factors Influencing Thunderstorm Height |last1= Haby |first1=Jeff |publisher=theweatherprediction.com |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flat, [[anvil]]-like top (anvil dome), caused by wind shear or [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] near the [[tropopause]]. The shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud's vertical component for many kilometres, and be accompanied by [[lightning]]. Occasionally, rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level (due to momentum) and form an [[overshooting top]] culminating at the [[maximum parcel level]]. When vertically developed, this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions. Even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison.

Cumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential [[rain]] of a [[convection|convective]] nature (often in the form of a [[rain shaft]]) and [[flash flood]]ing, as well as [[straight-line winds]]. Most storm cells die after about 20&amp;nbsp;minutes, when the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] causes more downdraft than updraft, causing the energy to dissipate. If there is enough [[solar energy]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], however (on a hot summer day, for example), the moisture from one storm cell can [[evaporation|evaporate]] rapidly—resulting in a new cell forming just a few kilometres from the former one. This can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours. Cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms (called &quot;[[blizzard]]s&quot;) which bring lightning, thunder, and torrential snow. However, cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/flying-through-‘thunderstorm-alley’|title=Flying through ‘Thunderstorm Alley’|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618075755/https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/flying-through-%E2%80%98thunderstorm-alley%E2%80%99|archive-date=18 June 2018|date=31 December 2014|website=[[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life cycle or stages ==
[[File:Thunderstorm formation.jpg|thumb|300px|Stages of a cumulonimbus cloud's life.]]
In general, cumulonimbus require moisture, an unstable air mass, and a lifting force (heat) in order to form. Cumulonimbus typically go through three stages: the '''developing stage''', the '''mature stage''' (where the main cloud may reach [[supercell]] status in favorable conditions), and the '''dissipation stage'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Weather&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Extreme Weather |author=Michael H.

Depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsbasics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tstorm/tst_basics.html |title=A Severe Weather Primer: Questions and Answers about Thunderstorms |author=National Severe Storms Laboratory |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |date=15 October 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825000832/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tstorm/tst_basics.html |archive-date=25 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cloud types ==
{{Main|List of cloud types}}
[[Cloud]]s form when the [[dewpoint]] temperature of [[water]] is reached in the presence of [[condensation nuclei]] in the [[troposphere]]. The atmosphere is a dynamic system, and the local conditions of [[turbulence]], [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds. Various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized. Furthermore, some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as [[wave cloud]]s or [[actinoform cloud]]s. These are large-scale structures and are not always readily identifiable from a single point of view.

The name &quot;Iguazú&quot; comes from the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] or [[Old Tupi|Tupi]] words &quot;''y''&quot; {{IPA-gn|ɨ|}}, meaning &quot;water&quot;, and &quot;''ûasú'' &quot;{{IPA-gn|waˈsu|}}, meaning &quot;big&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SATravel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/IguazuFalls.htm|title=Iguazu Falls|author=Bonnie Hamre|work=About.com Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a [[canoe]]. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall.&lt;ref name=SATravel/&gt; The first European to record the existence of the falls was the Spanish [[Conquistador]] [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] in 1541.

==Geology and geography==
[[Image:Iguazupan.ogv|thumb|left|Video clip: Close view of the falls from the Argentine side]]
The [[staircase]] character of the falls consists of a two-step waterfall formed by three layers of [[flood basalt|basalt]]. The steps are {{Convert|35 and 40|m||abbr=}} in height.  The [[columnar basalt]] rock sequences are part of the {{Convert|1000|m||-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} Serra Geral [[formation (geology)|Formation]] within the [[Paleozoic]]-[[Mesozoic]] Paraná [[Sedimentary basin|Basin]].  The tops of these sequences are characterized by {{Convert|8-10|m||abbr=on}} of [[geological resistance|highly resistant]] [[vesicular texture|vesicular]] basalt and the contact between these layers controls the shape of the falls.  [[Headward erosion|Headwater erosion]] rates are estimated at {{Convert|1.4-2.1|cm/year||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piotr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevaux|first1=Jose|last2=Latrubesse|first2=Edgardo|editor1-last=Migon|editor1-first=Piotr|title=Iguazu Falls: A History of Differential Fluvial Incision, in Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789048130542|pages=101–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iguazu Falls are located where the [[Iguazu River]] tumbles over the edge of the Paraná Plateau, {{convert|23|km|mi}} upriver from the Iguazu's confluence with the [[Paraná River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Iguaçu Falls |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9042070 |accessdate= 15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous islands along the {{convert|2.7|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} edge divide the falls into many separate waterfalls and cataracts, varying between {{convert|60|and|82|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. The number of these smaller waterfalls fluctuates from 150 to 300, depending on the water level. About half of the river's flow falls into a long and narrow chasm called the [[Devil's Throat, Iguazu Falls|Devil's Throat]] ({{lang|es|Garganta del Diablo}} in Spanish or {{lang|pt|Garganta do Diabo}} in Portuguese).&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

The Devil's Throat canyon is {{Convert|80–90|m||abbr=on}} wide and {{Convert|70-80|m||abbr=on}} deep.  Left of this canyon, another part of the river forms 160-200 individual falls, which merge into a single front during flood stage.  The largest falls are named San Martín, Adam and Eva, Penoni, and Bergano.&lt;ref name=Piotr/&gt;

About {{convert|900|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} of the {{convert|2.7|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} length does not have water flowing over it.  The water of the lower Iguazu collects in a canyon that drains into the [[Paraná River]], a short distance downstream from the [[Itaipu Dam]]. The junction of the water flows marks the border between Brazil, Argentina, and [[Paraguay]]. Some points in the cities of [[Foz do Iguaçu]], Brazil, [[Puerto Iguazú]], Argentina, and [[Ciudad del Este]], Paraguay, have access to the Iguazu River, where the borders of all three nations may be seen, a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the three cities.

==Distribution of the falls between Argentina and Brazil==
[[File:Iguazú Falls from ISS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Iguazú Falls from the [[International Space Station]], 2016]]
The Iguazu Falls are arranged in a way that resembles a reversed letter &quot;J&quot;. The [[Argentina–Brazil border]] runs through the Devil's Throat. On the right bank is the Brazilian territory, which is home to more than 95% of the Iguazu River basin but has just over 20% of the jumps of these falls, and the left side jumps are Argentine, which makes up almost 80% of the falls.

==Access==

[[File:Tren ecológico de la Selva Parque Nacional Iguazú.JPG|thumb|Ecological train to Devil's Throat, [[Iguazú National Park]], Argentina]]
The falls may be reached from two main towns, with one on either side of the falls: [[Foz do Iguaçu]] in Brazil and [[Puerto Iguazú]] in Argentina, as well as from [[Ciudad del Este]], Paraguay, on the other side of the Paraná River from Foz do Iguaçu, each of those three cities having commercial airports. The falls are shared by the [[Iguazú National Park]] (Argentina) and [[Iguaçu National Park]] (Brazil). The two parks were designated [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1984 and 1986, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/303|title=Iguazu National Park - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/355|title=Iguaçu National Park - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to &quot;future generations&quot;, just as &quot;it had been created by God&quot; and endowed with &quot;all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome&quot; and &quot;an unmatched flora&quot; located in the &quot;magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls&quot;. These were the words used by [[André Rebouças]], an engineer, in his book ''Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia'', which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls in 1876. At this time, [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the U.S., the first national park in the world, was four years old.

On the Brazilian side, a walkway along the canyon has an extension to the lower base of Devil's Throat. [[Helicopter]] rides offering aerial views of the falls have been available from Brazil, but Argentina has prohibited such helicopter tours because of the adverse environmental impact on the flora and fauna of the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iguazufalls.com/activities/helicopter-ride/ |title=IguazuFalls.com Helicopter Ride |publisher=IguazuFalls.com |accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Foz do Iguaçu airport, the park may be reached by taking a taxi or bus to the entrance of the park. Their park has an entrance fee on both sides. Once inside, free and frequent buses are provided to various points within the park. The town of Foz do Iguaçu is about {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away, and the airport is between the park and the town.
The Argentine access, across the forest, is by a [[Rainforest Ecological Train]] very similar to the one in [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The train brings visitors to the entrance of Devil's Throat, as well as the upper and lower trails. The ''Paseo Garganta del Diablo'' is a {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|1|abbr=on}} trail that brings visitors directly over the falls of Devil's Throat, the highest and deepest of the falls. Other walkways allow access to the elongated stretch of falls across the forest on the Argentine side and to the boats that connect to San Martin Island. Also on the Argentine side,  inflatable boat services take visitors very close to the falls.

The Brazilian transportation system aims at allowing the increase in the number of visitors, while reducing the adverse environmental impact, through an increase in the average number of passengers per vehicle inside the park.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The new transportation system has 72-passenger capacity and panoramic-view, double-deck buses.

==Comparisons to other notable falls==
{{See also|List of waterfalls by flow rate|Victoria Falls#Statistics}}
Upon seeing Iguazu, the United States First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] reportedly exclaimed, &quot;Poor [[Niagara Falls|Niagara]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=SATravel/&gt; (which, at 50 m or 165 feet, are a third shorter). Often, Iguazu also is compared with [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] in Southern Africa, which separates [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Iguazu is wider but is split into roughly 275 distinct falls and large islands, whereas Victoria has the largest curtain of water in the world, at more than {{convert|1600|m|0|abbr=on}} wide and over {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}} in height (in low flow, Victoria is split into five by islands but in high flow it may be uninterrupted). The only wider falls are extremely large rapid-like falls, such as the [[Boyoma Falls]] (Stanley Falls).

With the flooding of the [[Guaíra Falls]] in 1982, Iguazu currently has the [[List of waterfalls by flow rate|sixth-greatest average annual flow]] of any waterfall in the world, following number five Niagara, with an average rate of {{convert|1746|m3/s|cuft/s|-1|abbr=on}}. Its maximum recorded flow was {{convert|45700|m3/s|cuft/s|-3|abbr=on}} on 9 June 2014.&lt;!--source's numbers in m3/s properly rounded based on cfs rounding; clearly source converted to m3/s but did not properly round to significant digits--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maxflux2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://g1.globo.com/pr/oeste-sudoeste/noticia/2014/06/chuvas-fazem-vazao-das-cataratas-bater-recorde-e-itaipu-abrir-vertedouro.html|title = Chuvas fazem vazão das Cataratas bater recorde e Itaipu abrir vertedouro|date = 9 June 2014|accessdate = 11 June 2014|author = Fabiula Wurmeister|publisher = globo.com notícias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maxflux1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cataratasdoiguacu.com.br/portal/paginas/430-dia-historico-nas-cataratas-do-iguacu.aspx|title = Dia histórico nas Cataratas do Iguaçu|date = 10 June 2014|accessdate = 11 June 2014|publisher = Cataratas do Iguaçu S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the average flow of Niagara Falls is {{convert|2400|m3/s|cuft/s|-3|abbr=on}}, with a maximum recorded flow of {{convert|8300|m3/s|cuft/s|-3|abbr=on}}.&lt;!--properly rounded as above--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wwd-niagara&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Niagara Falls |publisher= World Waterfall Database |url= http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=142 |accessdate= 2 December 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201115458/http://world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=142 |archive-date= 1 December 2010 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average flow at Victoria Falls is {{convert|1088|m3/s|cuft/s|-1|abbr=on}}, with a maximum recorded flow of {{convert|7100|m3/s|cuft/s|-4|abbr=on}}.&lt;!--properly rounded as above--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wwd-victoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Victoria Falls |publisher= World Waterfall Database |url= http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=147 |accessdate= 2 December 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201102227/http://world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=147 |archive-date= 1 December 2010 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The Iguazu Falls experience a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with abundant precipitation and high temperatures year-round. During the summer of 2006, a severe drought caused the Iguazu River to become diminished, reducing the amount of water flowing over the falls to {{convert|300|m3/s|cuft/s}} until early December. This was unusual, as dry periods normally last only a few weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerala&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keralaarticles.blogspot.com/2007/11/iguazu-falls.html|title=The Kerala Articles|work=keralaarticles.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:BWI Overhead.jpg|thumb|Aerial of BWI Marshall Airport with [[Downtown Baltimore]] in background]]
Planning for a new airport on {{convert|3200|acre}} to serve the Baltimore-Washington area began just before the end of [[World War II]]. In 1944, the Baltimore Aviation Commission announced its decision that the best location to build a new airport would be on a {{convert|2100|acre|adj=on}} tract of land near [[Linthicum Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/151674708/ Arundel Tract Favored For Baltimore Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002318/http://search.proquest.com/docview/151674708/ |date=March 5, 2017 }}&quot;.

''The Baltimore Sun''. August 10, 1944. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of building the airport was estimated at $9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name= anne/&gt; The site was chosen because it was a 15-minute drive from downtown Baltimore; close to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] line, the [[Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad]] line, and the proposed [[Baltimore–Washington Parkway]]; and visibility was generally good.&lt;ref name= anne/&gt; An alternate site along [[Ritchie Highway|Gov. Ritchie Highway]] at [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Furnace Branch]] was rejected by the [[United States War Department]], and another possible site at [[Pasadena, Maryland|Lipin's Corner]] was deemed too far from Baltimore.&lt;ref name= anne/&gt; The State Aviation Commission approved of the Linthicum Heights site in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/151827918/ Linthicum Heights Airport Approved] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002315/http://search.proquest.com/docview/151827918/ |date=March 5, 2017 }}&quot;. ''The Washington Post''. March 17, 1946. p. M3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friendship International Airport''' was dedicated on June 24, 1950, by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]]. Truman arrived in the then official presidential plane [[Air Force One|Independence]] from nearby [[Washington National Airport]] carrying the [[Governor of Maryland]], [[William Preston Lane Jr.]], and Baltimore mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]] on his first aircraft flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Cooperation Built Airport, Truman Says: President Dedicates Baltimore Project; Praises Aid Programs Truman Lauds Cooperation|date=June 25, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost to construct the airport totaled $15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name= airportopen/&gt; The following month the airlines moved to the new airport from the old [[Baltimore Municipal Airport]] (Harbor Field in southeast Baltimore at {{coord|39.25|-76.53|display=inline}}). [[Eastern Airlines]] flew the first scheduled flight, a [[DC-3]], into the airport at 12:01 am on July 23, 1950.&lt;ref name= airportopen&gt;&quot;Friendship Airport Opens&quot;. ''The Washington Post''. July 24, 1950. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven minutes later, the same plane was also the first flight to depart from the airport.&lt;ref name= airportopen/&gt; 300 people came to watch the first flight arrive and depart.&lt;ref name= airportopen/&gt;

The Official Airline Guide for April 1957 shows 52 weekday departures: 19 [[Eastern Air Lines|Eastern]], 12 [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital]], 8 [[American Airlines|American]], 4 [[National Airlines (1934–1980)|National]], 3 [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], 3 [[United Airlines|United]], 2 [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], and 1 [[Allegheny Airlines|Allegheny]]. Miami had a couple of nonstop flights, but westward nonstop flights did not reach beyond Ohio; Baltimore's reach expanded when jet service started. The early Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s could not use [[Washington National Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]] did not open until 1962, so Baltimore became Washington's jet airport in May–June 1959 when American and TWA began transcontinental 707 flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/bwi-timeline/#1959 &quot;BWI History at a Glance&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208051146/http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/bwi-timeline |date=December 8, 2009 }} BWI Airport Timeline: 1950–59, retrieved November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s–1990s===
The [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] purchased Friendship International Airport from the City of Baltimore for $36 million in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friendship International Airport from the City of Baltimore for $36 million in 1972|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 8, 1984|author=John Mintz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under MDOT, the [[Maryland State Aviation Administration]] took over airfield operations and grew from three employees to more than 200. Plans to upgrade, improve, and modernize all Maryland airport facilities were announced almost immediately by the Secretary of Transportation, [[Harry Hughes]].

To attract passengers from the [[Washington metropolitan area]], particularly [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County|Prince George's]] counties,&lt;ref name= newname&gt;&quot;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/148324405/ New Name for Airport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002318/http://search.proquest.com/docview/148324405/ |date=March 5, 2017 }}&quot;.

The first phase of the airport's modernization was completed in 1974 at a cost of $30 million. Upgrades included improved instrument landing capabilities and runway systems, and construction of three new air cargo terminals, expanding the airport's freight capacity to {{convert|2.53|acre}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline1979&quot;/&gt;

The terminal renovation program was complete in 1979, the most dramatic work of the airport's modernization, which was designed by [[AECOM|DMJM]] along with Peterson &amp; Brickbauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charlesbrickbauer.com/|title=Projects: BWI Airport|publisher=Charles Brickbauer, Architect|accessdate=October 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128225135/http://charlesbrickbauer.com/|archive-date=November 28, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BWI terminal more than doubled in size to {{convert|14.58|acre|ha}}; the number of gate positions increased from 20 to 27.

To accommodate Southwest's extensive presence at the airport, in 2005 Concourses A and B were expanded, renovated, and integrated with one another to house all of that airline's operations there for their major operating base. This new facility, designed by [[URS Corporation]], opened on May 22, 2005. On October 1 of that year, the airport was renamed again, becoming '''Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport,''' to honor former [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] [[judge|justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]], who grew up in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline 2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/bwi-timeline/#2000 &quot;BWI History at a Glance&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208051146/http://www.bwiairport.com/en/about-bwi/bwi-timeline |date=December 8, 2009 }} BWI Airport Timeline: 2005, retrieved November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mlis.state.md.us/2005rs/chapters/Ch_442_HB0189E.pdf|title=An Act concerning Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Other State Facilities, Roads, and Bridges – Naming FOR the purpose of renaming the Baltimore-Washington International Airport as the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|access-date=November 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415150015/http://mlis.state.md.us/2005rs/chapters/Ch_442_HB0189E.pdf|archive-date=April 15, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

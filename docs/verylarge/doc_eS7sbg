In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180207105442/https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that &quot;the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago&quot;. Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of a process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing [[resource depletion]] to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;LivingPlanetReport2014&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |access-date=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archive-date=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in ''[[PLOS One]]'' found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of [[Sussex University]] stated that their study suggested that humans &quot;appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers|title=Warning of 'ecological Armageddon' after dramatic plunge in insect numbers|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2017|last1=Editor|first1=Damian Carrington Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, many species were formally classified as [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]]; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized.

A 2007 study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and ''vice versa''. &quot;If anyone type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.&quot;&lt;!-- the quote doesn't talk about genetic diversity --&gt;&lt;ref name=enn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/23391 |title= Study: Loss of Genetic Diversity Threatens Species Diversity |publisher= Enn.com |date= 26 September 2007 |access-date= 21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 report has revealed that bees and other pollinating insects have been wiped out of almost a quarter of their habitats across the United Kingdom. The population crashes have been happening since the 1980s and are affecting biodiversity. The increase in industrial farming and pesticide use, combined with diseases, invasive species, and climate change is threatening the future of these insects and the agriculture they support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/insects-pollination-bees-flies-uk-farming-agriculture-pesticides-climate-change-a8839306.html|title=Bees and other pollinating insects disappear from quarter of UK habitats in population crash|date=26 March 2019|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduced and invasive species===

Barriers such as large [[river]]s, [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3-link=Dobson, Andrew P|author3=Dobson, Andrew P. |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T |s2cid=4384385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|s2cid=13987518|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J.

Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|s2cid=8628360|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], ''[[Prunus spinosa]]'' from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its [[gene pool]]. This problem is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of [[gene flow]] is normal adaptation and not all [[gene]] and [[genotype]] constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | year = 1996 | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = Daniel | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | pages = 83–109 | jstor = 2097230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PottsBarbour2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bradley M. |last1=Potts|first2=Robert C.|last2= Barbour|first3=Andrew B. |last3=Hingston|title=Genetic Pollution from Farm Forestry Using Eucalypt Species and Hydrids: A Report for the RIRDC/L &amp; WA/FWPRDC Joint Venture Agroforestry Program|journal=Research Report, Chicken Meat &amp; Egg Programs|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PyQIOAAACAAJ}}|year=2001|publisher=RIRDC|isbn=978-0-642-58336-9 |issn=1440-6845}}

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution. This has resulted in the loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulletin28&quot;&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html &quot;Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal&quot;];  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified organism]]s contain genetic material that is altered through [[genetic engineering]]. [[Genetically modified crops]] have become a common source for genetic pollution in not only wild varieties, but also in domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pollan |first=Michael |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DE143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63 |title=The year in ideas: A TO Z.; Genetic Pollution; By Michael Pollan, The New York Times, December 9, 2001 |work=The New York Times|date=9 December 2001 |access-date=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n1/full/nbt0104-29.html |title=Dangerous Liaisons?

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulletin28&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

Climate change has advanced the time of evening when Brazilian free-tailed bats (''Tadarida brasiliensis'') emerge to feed.

In 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the ''[[Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]'', was published by the [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] (IPBES). The report was finalized in Paris. The main conclusions:

1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.

2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution, and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.

3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans, and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.

4. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including [[sustainable agriculture]], reductions in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. On page 8 the report proposes on page 8 of the summary &quot; enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption&quot; as one of the main measures. The report states that  &quot;Some pathways chosen to achieve the goals related to energy, economic growth, industry and infrastructure and sustainable consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9 and 12), as well as targets related to poverty, food security and cities (Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 11), could have substantial positive or negative impacts on nature and therefore on the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Summary for policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |date=6 May 2019 |publisher=the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |url=https://www.ipbes.net/sites/default/files/downloads/spm_unedited_advance_for_posting_htn.pdf |access-date=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Deutsche Welle |first1=Deutsche |title=Why Biodiversity Loss Hurts Humans as Much as Climate Change Does |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/biodiversity-loss-human-health-2636410357.html |access-date=10 May 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The October 2020 &quot;Era of Pandemics&quot; report by IPBES asserted that the same human activities which are the underlying drivers of [[climate change]] and [[biodiversity loss]] are also the same drivers of [[pandemics]], including the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Dr. [[Peter Daszak]], Chair of the IPBES workshop, said &quot;there is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic – or of any modern pandemic . . . Changes in the way we use land; the expansion and intensification of agriculture; and unsustainable trade, production and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between wildlife, livestock, pathogens and people. This is the path to pandemics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mcelwee |first=Pamela |date=November 2, 2020 |title=COVID-19 and the biodiversity crisis |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/523944-covid-19-and-the-biodiversity-crisis |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=November 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IPBESPandemic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipbes.net/pandemics |title=Escaping the 'Era of Pandemics': Experts Warn Worse Crises to Come Options Offered to Reduce Risk |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2020|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]|access-date=November 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

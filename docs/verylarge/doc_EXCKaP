The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements [[Zionism|among the Jews]] and [[Arab nationalism|among the Arabs]], both geared towards attaining sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaConflict&quot; /&gt; The [[Balfour Declaration]] was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=James |last=Gelvin |authorlink=James L.

The return of several hard-line Palestinian Arab nationalists, under the emerging leadership of [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], from Damascus to [[Mandatory Palestine]] marked the beginning of [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian Arab nationalist struggle]] towards establishment of a national home for Arabs of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sela |editor-first=Avraham |editor-link=Avraham Sela |chapter=Palestine Arabs |title=The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East |location=New York |year=2002 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=9780826414137 |pages=664–673 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin al-Husseini, the architect of the Palestinian Arab national movement, immediately marked [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,&lt;ref name=&quot;al-Husseini&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sela|2002|p=361|loc=&quot;al-Husseini, Hajj (Muhammad) Amin&quot;}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He [Husseini] incited and headed anti-Jewish riots in April 1920. ...

Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force [[Haganah]]. In 1929, a series of violent [[1929 Palestine riots|anti-Jewish riots]] was initiated by the Arab leadership. The riots resulted in massive Jewish casualties in [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron]] and [[1929 Safed riots|Safed]], and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaConflict&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Palest against british.gif|right|thumb|The [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt of 1936–1939]] in Palestine, motivated by opposition to mass [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]].]]

In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, most notably [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam|Sheikh Izaddin al-Qassam]] from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936 Arab revolt. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, the tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence and the bloodily repressed [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] against the British and the Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryPBS&quot; /&gt; In the first wave of organized violence, lasting until early 1937, most of the Arab groups were defeated by the British and forced expulsion of much of the Arab leadership was performed. The revolt led to the establishment of the [[Peel Commission]] towards partitioning of Palestine, though it was subsequently rejected by the Palestinian Arabs. The two main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion]], accepted the recommendations but some secondary Jewish leaders did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Louis |first=William Roger |title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization |year=2006 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781845113476 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |author-link=Benny Morris |title=One State, Two States: Resolving the Israel/Palestine Conflict |year=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300156041 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RelhRR-9RUC |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |title=The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521009676 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewed violence, which had sporadically lasted until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties, mostly from the Arab side. With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs, under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab [[Palestine Regiment]] under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini however tended to cooperation with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. Defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv. By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of the Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the [[Yishuv]] and the Palestinian Arab leadership. Immigration quotas were established by the British, while on the other hand illegal immigration and Zionist insurgency against the British was increasing.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaConflict&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
Following the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baum&quot; /&gt; The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank]] and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the [[All-Palestine Government]] was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryPBS&quot; /&gt;

Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the [[Palestinian Fedayeen]] militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out [[reprisal operations]] in the host countries. The [[1956 Suez Crisis]] resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the [[All-Palestine Government]], which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the [[United Arab Republic]], to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. [[Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]] then was put under the authority of Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baum&quot; /&gt; It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the [[Arab League]].

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as Israel gained military control of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Consequently, the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and established its headquarters in Jordan, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and supported the Jordanian army during the [[War of Attrition]], most notably the [[Battle of Karameh]]. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the [[Black September in Jordan|Jordanian–Palestinian civil war]] in 1970. The PLO defeat by the Jordanians caused most of the Palestinian militants to relocate to South Lebanon, where they soon took over large areas, creating the so-called &quot;Fatahland&quot;.

[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon]] peaked in the early 1970s, as Lebanon was used as a base to launch attacks on northern Israel and airplane hijacking campaigns worldwide, which drew Israeli retaliation. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the [[Coastal Road massacre]] led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as [[Operation Litani]]. Israeli forces, however, quickly withdrew from Lebanon, and the attacks against Israel resumed. In 1982, following an assassination attempt on one of its diplomats by Palestinians, the Israeli government decided to take sides in the Lebanese Civil War and the [[1982 Lebanon War]] commenced. The initial results for Israel were successful. Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryPBS&quot; /&gt; However, Israeli intervention in the civil war also led to unforeseen results, including small-scale conflict between Israel and Syria. By 1985, Israel withdrew to a 10&amp;nbsp;km occupied strip of South Lebanon, while the low-intensity conflict with Shia militants escalated.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaConflict&quot; /&gt;{{citation needed span|text= Those Iranian-supported Shia groups gradually consolidated into Hizbullah and Amal, operated against Israel, and allied with the remnants of Palestinian organizations to launch attacks on Galilee through the late 1980s. By the 1990s, Palestinian organizations in Lebanon were largely inactive.|date=March 2013}}

The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to escalating attacks and the endless occupation. By the early 1990s, international efforts to settle the conflict had begun, in light of the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually, the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] led to the [[Oslo Accords]] of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], establishing the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. The peace process also had significant opposition among radical Islamic elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of radical anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Rabin was assassinated]] by an Israeli fanatic who objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, from which the newly elected government of Israel in 1996 backed off.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaConflict&quot; /&gt;

Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the [[Second Intifada]] in September 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryPBS&quot; /&gt; The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the [[Palestinian National Security Forces]] and the [[Israel Defense Forces]], lasted until 2004/2005 and led to approximately [[Operation Days of Penitence Fatalities|130 fatalities]]. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it &quot;had no effective control over what occurred&quot; in Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn2009-01-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory? |last=Levs |first=Josh|date=6 January 2009|publisher=CNN|access-date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United Nations]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and many other international bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn2009-01-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AI_briefing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/007/2009/en/ |title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability |date=2009-01-19 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |access-date=2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isrlpa13698&quot;&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm &quot;Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015172833/http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm |date=15 October 2008 }} 6 July 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Israeli officials led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Palestinian leaders from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. In 1993, the Oslo Accords were finalized as a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian relations. The crux of the Oslo agreement was that Israel would gradually cede control of the Palestinian territories over to the Palestinians in exchange for peace. The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts, the process took a turning point at the [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin]] and finally unraveled when Arafat and [[Ehud Barak]] failed to reach agreement at Camp David in July 2000. [[Robert Malley]], special assistant to US President [[Bill Clinton]] for Arab–Israeli Affairs, has confirmed that while Barak made no formal written offer to Arafat, the US did present concepts for peace which were considered by the Israeli side yet left unanswered by Arafat &quot;the Palestinians' principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malley, Robert and Hussein Agha.

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as &quot;bases for negotiation&quot;, via the US to the Palestinian President; a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92%&lt;ref group=note&gt;Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers. Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which reduces the total to 5,538&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective. &lt;br /&gt; Jeremy Pressman, ''International Security'', vol 28, no. 2, Fall 2003, [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/pressman.pdf ''&quot;Visions in Collision: What Happened at Camp David and Taba?&quot;''].

===Developments following Camp David===
{{Main|The Clinton Parameters}}
Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the [[Second Intifada]] at the end of September.&lt;ref name=JPressman/&gt;

Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem the plan stated that, &quot;the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli.&quot; The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgement of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a &quot;non-militarized&quot; Palestinian state, and an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan&lt;ref name=JPressman/&gt;&lt;ref name=USEmbassy&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCERPTS: STATE DEPT.

===Taba Summit (2001)===
{{Main|Taba Summit}}

The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the [[Taba Summit]] in [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba, Egypt]] in January 2001.  The proposition removed the &quot;temporarily Israeli controlled&quot; areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: &quot;The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections.&quot; The following month the [[Likud]] party candidate [[Ariel Sharon]] defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.&lt;ref name=JPressman/&gt;

===Road Map for Peace===
{{Main|Road map for peace}}
One peace proposal, presented by the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel moves to green light 2,200 new settlement units, recognizes outposts |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.684929|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=3 December 2015|date=2015-11-09|last1=Levinson|first1=Chaim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN: Israeli-Palestinian violence nears 'catastrophe'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/israeli-palestinian-violence-151029060544251.html|publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the dead in latest Israeli-Palestinian violence |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/10/mapping-dead-latest-israeli-palestinian-violence-151013142015577.html |publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Peace Initiative===
{{Main|Arab Peace Initiative}}
The Arab Peace Initiative ({{lang-ar|مبادرة السلام العربية}} ''Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah'') was first proposed by Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] at the [[Beirut Summit]] (2002). The peace initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Prince al-Faisal tells Haaretz: Desire for peace exists both in Gaza and Ramallah - Israel Conference on Peace TLV|url=http://www.haaretz.com/peace/1.685313|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=3 December 2015|date=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut Summit, and agreed upon again in 2007 in the [[2007 Arab League Summit|Riyadh Summit]].

Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out &quot;final-solution&quot; borders based explicitly on the UN borders established before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the [[Golan Heights]], to recognize &quot;an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital&quot; in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a &quot;just solution&quot; for the Palestinian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3691148,00.html &quot;The Saudi Arabia peace initiative.&quot;] ''[[Ynetnews]]''.  23 March 2009.  21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Israeli officials have responded to the initiative with both support and criticism. The Israeli government has expressed reservations on 'red line,' issues such as the Palestinian refugee problem, homeland security concerns, and the nature of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About%20the%20Ministry/MFA%20Spokesman/2002/Response%20of%20FM%20Peres%20to%20the%20decisions%20of%20the%20Arab &quot;Response of FM Peres to the decisions of the Arab Summit in Beirut.&quot;].

===Present status===
The peace process has been predicated on a &quot;two-state solution&quot; thus far, but questions have been raised towards both sides' resolve to end the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2013/06/18/israels-legal-obligations|title=Palestinian Chief Negotiator, Saeb Erekat, on Israel's Legal Obligations |author=Richard Horowitz |work=World Policy Review |date=18 June 2013 |access-date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by S.

====Israel's settlement policy====
[[File:SettlersShuhadaStreet.jpg|thumb|Israeli settlers in [[Hebron]], West Bank]]

====Israeli Military Police====
In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, [[Amnesty International]] asserted that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself &quot;to the highest of professional standards,&quot; adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action &quot;where appropriate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crispian Balmer,[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-palestinians-israel-amnesty-idUSBREA1Q00G20140227 'Amnesty says some Israeli West Bank killings may be war crimes,'] [[Reuters]] 26 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/002/2014/en/ 'Trigger-happy:Israel's use of excessive force in the West Bank,'] [[Amnesty International]], February 2014 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public support====
Polling data has produced mixed results regarding the level of support among Palestinians for the two-state solution. A poll was carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University; it indicated that support for a two-state solution was growing among both Israelis and Palestinians. The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the [[Clinton Parameters]], compared with 47% of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians and 70% of Israelis expressing their support for an end to violence, an increase of 2% for Israelis and 5% for Palestinians from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=251311 |title=Support growing for two-state solution |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 December 2011 |access-date=10 February 2012 |author=Lidman, Melanie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152656/http://www.jpost.com/diplomacyandpolitics/article.aspx?id=251311 |archivedate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues in dispute===
The following outlined positions are the official positions of the two parties; however, it is important to note that neither side holds a single position. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides include both moderate and [[Extremism|extremist]] bodies as well as [[Political dove|dovish]] and [[War Hawk|hawkish]] bodies.

One of the primary obstacles to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is a deep-set and growing distrust between its participants. Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence and incitements by civilians against one another, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the peace process. Support among Palestinians for [[Hamas]] is considerable, and as its members consistently call for the destruction of Israel and [[Palestinian political violence|violence]] remains a threat, [[#Israeli security concerns|security]] becomes a prime concern for many Israelis. The expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-basics.com/2011/israel-and-the-palestinians/|title=Overview of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians|work=News Basics|access-date=13 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424152450/http://news-basics.com/2011/israel-and-the-palestinians/|archivedate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jerusalem====

The control of Jerusalem is a particularly delicate issue, with each side asserting claims over the city. The three largest [[Abrahamic religions]]—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city for Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the [[Temple Mount]] and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the site of [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mohammad's Night Journey]] to heaven, and the [[al-Aqsa mosque]]. For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of [[crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

The Israeli government, including the [[Knesset]] and [[Israeli Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], is located in the &quot;new city&quot; of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948. After Israel captured the Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] declaring &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/Basic_Law_Jerusalem.html &quot;Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel.&quot;] [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. 9 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, notable exceptions being Israel, the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |last2=Labott |first2=Elise |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/politics/president-donald-trump-jerusalem/index.html |work=CNN |access-date=7 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahren |first=Raphael |date=6 April 2017 |title=In curious twist, Russia recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel's capital |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-historic-first-russia-recognizes-west-jerusalem-as-israels-capital/ |work=The Times of Israel |location=Jerusalem |access-date=7 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of UN member states and most international organisations do not recognise Israel's claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after the 1967 Six-Day War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/DDE590C6FF232007852560DF0065FDDB|title=UN security Council Resolution 478|publisher=unispal.un.org|access-date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the &quot;Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; described East Jerusalem as &quot;occupied Palestinian territory.&quot;&lt;ref name=RL2008&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapidoth|first=Ruth|title=Jerusalem – Some Legal Issues|url=http://www.jiis.org/.upload/lapidoth-jerusalem.pdf|publisher=The Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies|access-date=7 April 2013|pages=21–26|postscript=Reprinted from: Rüdiger Wolfrum (Ed.), The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (Oxford University Press, online 2008-, print 2011)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605013337/http://www.jiis.org/.upload/lapidoth-jerusalem.pdf|archive-date=5 June 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, there were more than 719,000 people living in Jerusalem; 465,000 were Jews (mostly living in West Jerusalem) and 232,000 were Muslims (mostly living in East Jerusalem).&lt;ref&gt;Zaritzky, Suzanna. [http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf &quot;Press Release.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614014210/http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf |date=14 June 2007 }} ''[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]]''. 24 May 2006. 9 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Camp David and Taba Summits in 2000–2001, the United States proposed a plan in which the Arab parts of Jerusalem would be given to the proposed Palestinian state while the Jewish parts of Jerusalem were given to Israel. All archaeological work under the Temple Mount would be jointly controlled by the Israeli and Palestinian governments. Both sides accepted the proposal in principle, but the summits ultimately failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaJerusalem&quot; /&gt;

Israel expresses concern over the security of its residents if neighborhoods of Jerusalem are placed under Palestinian control. Jerusalem has been a prime target for attacks by militant groups against civilian targets since 1967. Many Jewish neighborhoods have been fired upon from Arab areas. The proximity of the Arab areas, if these regions were to fall in the boundaries of a Palestinian state, would be so close as to threaten the safety of Jewish residents.&lt;ref&gt;Nadav Shragai states this idea in his study for the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], &quot;An Israeli security body that was tasked in March 2000 with examining the possibility of transferring three Arab villages just outside Jerusalem – Abu Dis, Al Azaria, and a-Ram – to Palestinian security control, assessed at the time that: 'Terrorists will be able to exploit the short distances, sometimes involving no more than crossing a street, to cause damage to people or property. A terrorist will be able to stand on the other side of the road, shoot at an Israeli or throw a bomb, and it may be impossible to do anything about it. The road will constitute the border.' If that is the case for neighborhoods outside Jerusalem's municipal boundaries, how much more so for Arab neighborhoods within those boundaries.{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/text/shragai_last2.pdf

====Holy sites====
Israel has concerns regarding the welfare of Jewish holy places under possible Palestinian control. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, no Jews were allowed to visit the [[Western Wall]] or other Jewish holy places, and the Jewish cemetery on the [[Mount of Olives]] was desecrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaJerusalem&quot; /&gt; Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping at [[Joseph's Tomb]], a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the [[mihrab]]. During the Second Intifada the site was looted and burned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dore Gold|Gold]].

Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and Muslim holy places under Israeli control.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In general, Israeli policy towards holy places can be considered a success with regard to its primary goal: facilitating Israel's acceptance into the international community of nations. However, the repeated failure of the Muslim Affairs Department to fulfill its mandate of protecting the Muslim holy places in Israel has been a largely forgotten chapter in Israeli history that deserves reexamination&quot;. Alisa Rubin Peled, ''Debating Islam in the Jewish State: The Development of Policy Toward Islamic Institutions in Israel'', State University of New York Press, 2001 p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the [[Western Wall Tunnel]] was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/03/27/47501.html &quot;Secret tunnel under Al-Aqsa Mosque exposed.&quot;] [[Al Arabiya]]. 27 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied this claim in a 1996 speech to the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1997/9/FM+Levy-+Address+to+the+UN+Security+Council+-Sept.htm &quot;FM Levy- Address to the UN Security Council.&quot;] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 27 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized the statement as &quot;escalation of rhetoric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict&lt;ref name=&quot;Efrat&quot; /&gt; and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first2=Mohammed|last2=Dajani Daoudi |authorlink2=Mohammed Dajani Daoudi|first1=Joel|title=THE ISRAEL–PALESTINE CONFLICT Parallel discourses |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-83939-3|pages=26, 37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ubfEsbawzoC&amp;q=The+Israel-Palestine+Conflict+Parallel+Discourses}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from Israel following its creation was estimated at 711,000 in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1950 |url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883!OpenDocument |title=General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Covering the Period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950 |publisher=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine |access-date=20 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203241/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883%21OpenDocument |archivedate=11 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of these original Palestinian Refugees are also eligible for registration and services provided by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA), and as of 2010 number 4.7 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=86 &quot;UNRWA-Palestinian refugees.&quot;] UNRWA, 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in [[Jordan]], Lebanon, [[Syria]], the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

However, according to reports of private peace negotiations with Israel they have countenanced the return of only 10,000 refugees and their families to Israel as part of a peace settlement. [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the current Chairman of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] was reported to have said in private discussion that it is &quot;illogical to ask Israel to take 5 million, or indeed 1 million.

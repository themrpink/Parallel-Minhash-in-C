Until World War II, most of Nassau County was still farmland, particularly in the eastern portion. Following the war, the county saw an influx of people from the five boroughs of New York City, especially from Brooklyn and Queens, who left their urban dwellings for a more suburban setting. This led to a massive population boom in the county. In 1947, [[William Levitt]] built his first [[planned community]] in Nassau County, in the Island Trees section (later renamed [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]]). (This should not be confused with the county's first planned community, in general, which is [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]].) While in the 1930s, [[Robert Moses]] had engineered curving [[parkways]] and parks such as [[Jones Beach State Park]] and [[Bethpage State Park]] for the enjoyment of city-dwellers, in the 1950s and 1960s the focus turned to alleviating commuter traffic.

In 1994, Federal Judge Arthur Spatt declared the Nassau County Board of Supervisors unconstitutional and directed that a 19-member legislature be formed.&lt;ref&gt;McQuiston, John T. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/judge-says-he-will-create-nassau-legislature-his-own-if-supervisors-fail-act.html &quot;Judge Says He Will Create a Nassau Legislature on His Own if Supervisors Fail to Act&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 9, 1994.

According to a ''Forbes'' magazine 2012 survey, residents of Nassau County have the 12th highest median household annual income in the country and the highest in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes-2012-ranks-Nassau-12th&quot;/&gt; In the 1990s, however, Nassau County experienced substantial budget problems, forcing the county to near [[bankruptcy]]. Thus, the county government increased taxes to prevent a takeover by the state of New York, leading to the county having high [[property tax]]es.  Nevertheless, on January 27, 2011, a New York State oversight board seized control of Nassau County's finances, saying the wealthy and heavily taxed county had failed to balance its $2.6 billion budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/nyregion/27nassau.html?hp |title=New York State Takes Control of Nassau's Finances |work=The New York Times |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassau County occupies a portion of Long Island immediately east of the New York City borough of Queens. It is [[Administrative divisions of New York|divided into]] two cities and three towns, the latter of which contain 64 villages and numerous hamlets. The county borders [[Connecticut]] across the [[Long Island Sound]].

Between the [[1990 United States Census|1990 census]] and the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the county exchanged territory with Suffolk County and lost territory to Queens County.&lt;ref name=PopH2000&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-3-34.pdf |title=New York: 2000 Population and Housing Unit Counts |date=September 2003 |accessdate=March 12, 2012 |page=III-9}}

===Climate===
Nassau County has a climate similar to other coastal areas of the [[Northeastern United States]]; it has warm, humid summers and cool, wet winters. The county is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') by some definitions, particularly closer to NYC and on the south coast (other areas of Nassau have a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'')). A significant portion of the western area of the county is ''Cfa'' due to being downwind from the [[urban heat island]] of NYC. The winters used to be colder with more snowstorms, but have warmed due to climate change.  The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Nassau County has a moderately sunny climate, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=December 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|archivedate=April 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}

===Law enforcement===
{{Main|Nassau County Police Department}}
[[County police]] services are provided by the [[Nassau County Police Department]]. The cities of [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]] and [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], as well as a number of villages, are not members of the county police district and maintain their own police forces. The following village police departments exist in Nassau County: Centre Island, Floral Park, Freeport, Garden City, Great Neck Estates, Hempstead, Kensington, Kings Point, Lake Success, Lynbrook, Malverne, Muttontown, Old Brookville (Old Brookville P.D. provides police protection for Old Brookville, Brookville, Upper Brookville, Matinecock, Mill Neck and Cove Neck), Old Westbury, Oyster Bay Cove, Rockville Centre and Sands Point.  The Port Washington Police Department is not a village department but is authorized by a special district, the only such district in New York State.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} These smaller forces, however, make use of such specialized county police services as the police academy and the aviation unit. Also, all homicides in the county are investigated by the county police, regardless of whether or not they occur within the police district.

On June 1, 2011, the Muttontown Police Department commenced operations.  The Old Brookville Police had formerly provided police services to the Village of Muttontown.

In 2006, village leaders in the county seat of [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] expressed dissatisfaction with the level of police coverage provided by the county force and actively explored seceding from the police district and having the village form its own police force. A referendum on December 5, 2006, however, decisively defeated the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antonnews.com/mineolaamerican/2006/12/15/news/referendum.html Residents Make Statement Against Village Police Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013038/http://www.antonnews.com/mineolaamerican/2006/12/15/news/referendum.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}, ''Mineola American'', December 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Long Island State Parkway Police]] was disbanded in 1980, all of Nassau County's state parkways have been patrolled by Troop L of the [[New York State Police]]. State parks in Nassau are patrolled by the [[New York State Park Police]]. In 1996, the [[Long Island Rail Road]] Police Department was consolidated into the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police]]. The MTA Police patrol Long Island Rail Road tracks, stations and properties. The [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Police]] provides enforcement of state environmental laws and regulations.  The [[State University of New York Police]] provides enforcement for [[SUNY Old Westbury]].

The Nassau County Police Department posts the mug shots of [[Driving While Intoxicated|DWI]] offenders as press releases on their website. This practice has come under the scrutiny of residents, media, and those pictured in these press releases. This practice has been criticized as being able to cost potential employees, students, or public figures their positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/handle/1951/48384 Nassau County Should be Ashamed], ''The Statesman'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

County correctional services and enforcement of court orders are provided by the [[Nassau County, New York Sheriff's Department|Nassau County Sheriff's Department]]. [[New York State Court Officers]] provide security for [[courthouse]]s.

[[File:NCAP RMP.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A Nassau County Auxiliary Police car.]]
The Nassau County Auxiliary Police are a unit of the [[Nassau County Police Department]]. These volunteer police officers are assigned to 1 of 38 local community units and perform routine patrols of the neighborhood and provide traffic control for local parades, races and other community events. Auxiliary Police officers are empowered to make arrests for crimes that occur in their presence. Nassau County Auxiliary Police are required to complete a 42-week training course at the Nassau County Police Academy and qualified officers are also offered Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training. Auxiliary Police officers are certified and registered by the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services as full-time &quot;peace officers&quot;. The [[Long Beach, New York|City of Long Beach]] has an independent [[Long Beach Police Department (New York)|Auxiliary Police force]] which is part of its municipal police force. These officers are represented by the Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association of Long Island.

{{Hidden end}}

Before, during and for the first four decades after World War II, like neighboring [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], Nassau County residents primarily supported the Republican Party in national elections. However, in the 1990s, the tide of voter support began to shift toward the Democratic Party. Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] carried the county in the presidential elections of [[1992 U.S. presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 U.S. presidential election|1996]]. Later Nassau voters gave a large plurality of the vote to [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 U.S. presidential election|2000]] (19.4%), while [[John Kerry]]'s Nassau margin in [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004]] was considerably slimmer (5.6%). In that election, Kerry won the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead, but lost the Town of Oyster Bay. The County went solidly for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and by a similar margin for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The County voted for [[Joseph Biden]] in the 2020 general election. 

Democratic strength is chiefly concentrated in both the wealthier and more lower income sections of the county.  Liberal voters dominate many of the wealthy communities of the North Shore, particularly in the town of [[North Hempstead]] where affluent villages such as [[Sands Point, New York|Sands Point]], [[Old Westbury, New York|Old Westbury]], [[Roslyn, New York|Roslyn]], [[East Hills, New York|East Hills]], [[Kensington, New York|Kensington]], [[Thomaston, New York|Thomaston]], [[Great Neck Plaza, New York|Great Neck Plaza]], and [[Great Neck Estates, New York|Great Neck Estates]] as well as the neighboring city of [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]] vote consistently Democratic.  Democratic strongholds also include several low income municipalities in the central portion of the county, such as the village of [[Hempstead (village)|Hempstead]], [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]], [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]] and [[New Cassel, New York|New Cassel]], as well as in a few waterfront communities on the South Shore, such as the city of [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]] and the village of [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]].

Republican voters are primarily concentrated in the middle to upper middle class southeastern portion of the county, which developed during the &quot;post-war boom-era.&quot;  Heavily Republican communities such as [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]], [[Massapequa Park, New York|Massapequa Park]], [[Seaford, New York|Seaford]], [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]], [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]], and [[Farmingdale, New York|Farmingdale]] are the political base of many county GOP officials such as Congressman [[Peter T. King]] and former County Executive [[Edward P. Mangano]].  In the western portion of the county, wealthy [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]] is solidly Republican, as is the more middle-class community of [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]].  Additionally, some of the more rustic areas of the North Shore, particularly in the town of [[Oyster Bay, New York|Oyster Bay]] usually vote for the GOP.

Areas of the county containing large numbers of swing voters are in [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]], [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]], and [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] on the South Shore and [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] on the North Shore.  Several areas have changed in partisan affiliation.  Formerly Democratic strongholds such as the [[Five Towns]] have trended to the GOP while previously Republican areas such as [[Elmont, New York|Elmont]] and [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin]] have become Democratic bastions.

The dean of the Long Island Congressional Delegation, Representative [[Peter T. King]], is from Nassau County. His [[New York's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]] includes heavily populated suburban neighborhoods like [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]], [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], [[Seaford, New York|Seaford]], [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]], and [[Farmingdale, New York|Farmingdale]]. However, Nassau County is also home to the popular former district attorney, Democrat [[Kathleen M. Rice]], whose [[New York's 4th congressional district|4th District]] includes [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], [[Carle Place, New York|Carle Place]], [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]], [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]], [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]], [[Valley Stream, New York|Valley Stream]], [[Franklin Square, New York|Franklin Square]], [[West Hempstead, New York|West Hempstead]] and portions of the Village of Freeport and [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]].

Nassau County's other two congressmen are both Democrats. Representative [[Gregory Meeks]] represents the [[New York's 5th congressional district|5th District]], which includes the southwestern part of the county, including [[Valley Stream, New York|Valley Stream]]. [[Thomas Suozzi]]'s [[New York's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]] includes [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], [[Port Washington, New York|Port Washington]], [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]], [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]], [[Hicksville, New York|Hicksville]], [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]], and [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]] in Nassau County.

Seven out of Long Island's nine [[New York Senate|state senators]] are Republican at the start of the 2017–2019 legislative term in January 2017, with the exceptions being State Senator John Brooks and Senator Todd Kaminsky.

==Education==
Nassau County has 56 public [[school district]]s, which like post office districts use the same names as a city, hamlet, or village within them, but each sets the boundaries independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkschools.com/counties/nassau.html | title=Public School Districts in Nassau County, NY | accessdate=November 11, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The number of districts and communities do not coincide, therefore the boundaries cannot be the same, and residences often have postal addresses that differ from the name of the hamlet and/or school district in which they are located.

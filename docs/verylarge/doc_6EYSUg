Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method. Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable. Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.

=== Effectiveness ===
Some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals. For example, [[Sweden]] has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} A study of [[Maize]] fields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic [[nematode]]s and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;nematodes&quot; /&gt;

However, pesticide resistance is increasing. In the 1940s, U.S. farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests. Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panna.org/issues/pesticides-101-primer#2|title=Pesticides 101 - A primer on pesticides, their use in agriculture and the exposure we face|publisher=Pesticide Action Network|access-date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}

==Types==
Pesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control. Pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of DDT, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides are derived from a common source or production method.&lt;ref name=&quot;US-EPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/types.htm|title=Types of Pesticides|publisher=US [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328231904/http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/types.htm|archive-date=March 28, 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecticides===
[[Neonicotinoids]] are a class of neuro-active [[insecticide]]s chemically similar to [[nicotine]].

[[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]] insecticides have a similar [[mode of action]]. They affect the nervous system of target pests (and non-target organisms) by disrupting [[acetylcholinesterase]] activity, the enzyme that regulates [[acetylcholine]], at nerve [[synapse]]s. This inhibition causes an increase in synaptic [[acetylcholine]] and over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colović MB, Krstić DZ, Lazarević-Pašti TD, Bondžić AM, Vasić VM | title = Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: pharmacology and toxicology | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–35 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 24179466 | pmc = 3648782 | doi = 10.2174/1570159X11311030006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these insecticides, first developed in the mid 20th century, are very poisonous.

[[Pyrethroid]] insecticides were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums.

===Biopesticides===
{{Main|Biopesticide}}
[[Biopesticides]] are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides. Biopesticides fall into three major classes:

* [[Microbial]] pesticides which consist of bacteria, [[entomopathogenic fungi]] or viruses (and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce). Entomopathogenic [[nematode]]s are also often classed as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coombs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Coombs|first=Amy | name-list-style = vanc |title=Fighting Microbes with Microbes|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33703/title/Fighting-Microbes-with-Microbes/|work=The Scientist|access-date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microbial Insecticides: Principles and Applications|date=2011|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=9781619427709|editor-last=Borgio|editor-first=J.

* Biochemical pesticides or herbal pesticides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=GK|last2=Kumar|first2=B|date=2013|title=Antifungal activity of some common weed extracts against wilt causing fungi, ''Fusarium oxysporum''|url=https://www.academia.edu/5848539|url-status=live|journal=Current Discovery|volume=2|issue=1|pages=62–67|issn=2320-4400|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209123704/http://www.academia.edu/5848539/Antifungal_activity_of_some_common_weed_extracts_against_wilt_causing_fungi_Fusarium_oxysporum_Article_Information_Abstract|archive-date=December 9, 2018|via=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt; are naturally occurring substances that control (or monitor in the case of [[pheromones]]) pests and microbial diseases.
* Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material (''i.e.'' [[GM crop]]s). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npic.orst.edu/reg/pip.html|title=Plant Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) / Genetically Modified Plants|date=February 9, 2017|website=npic.orst.edu|publisher=[[National Pesticide Information Center|US NPIC]]|access-date=Dec 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further types===
The term pesticide also include these substances:

*[[Defoliant]]s: Cause leaves or other foliage to drop from a plant, usually to facilitate harvest.
*[[Crop desiccation|Desiccants]]: Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.
*[[Insect growth regulator]]s: Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.
*[[Plant growth regulator]]s: Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.
*'''Soil sterilant''': a chemical that temporarily or permanently prevents the growth of all plants and animals, depending on the chemical.  [[Soil]] sterilants must be registered as pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= Jasper Womach}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wood preservation|Wood preservatives]]: They are used to make wood resistant to insects, fungus, and other pests.

==Regulation==
===International===
Many countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook|last=Willson|first=Harold R.|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1996|editor-last=Radcliffe|editor-first=E.

In Europe, EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are [[carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]] or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are [[persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic]] (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) and measures have been approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/066-45937-012-01-03-911-20090112IPR45936-12-01-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|title=MEPs approve pesticides legislation|date=Jan 13, 2009|website=europarl.europa.eu|publisher=EU Parliament|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201195914/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/066-45937-012-01-03-911-20090112IPR45936-12-01-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|archive-date=February 1, 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=Dec 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides, and products on which they were used are traded across international borders. To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/PM_Code.htm|title=Programmes: International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization|UN FAO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202034101/http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpp/pesticid/Code/PM_Code.htm|archive-date=December 2, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.&lt;ref name=code&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | date = 2002 | url = http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/Download/code.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404190746/http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/Download/code.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 4 April 2013 | title = International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the [[United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade]] and the [[Codex Alimentarius|United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission]]. The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=JD|date=1997|title=International Pesticide Trade: Is There any Hope for the Effective Regulation of Controlled Substances?|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/vol131/reyn.html|journal=Journal of Land Use &amp; Environmental Law|volume=13|issue=1|pages=69–105|jstor=42842699|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527062748/http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/vol131/reyn.html|archive-date=May 27, 2012|via=|jstor-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from [[pesticide misuse]], but do not eliminate all misuse. Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCE&quot;/&gt; [[Integrated pest management]], the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], the U.S., [[Australia]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sustaining&quot;/&gt; IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an [[ecosystem]], so that natural balances are not upset.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks. In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.

Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's lifecycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/10/011010074556.htm|title=Environmentally-Friendly Pesticide To Combat Potato Cyst Nematodes|last=NWO|first=|date=October 11, 2001|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=December 10, 2018|authorlink=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[potato cyst nematode]]s emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the [[nematode]]s to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;/&gt; During the registration process, a label is created. The label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions. Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a [[Toxicity Class]]. Pesticides are the most thoroughly tested chemicals after drugs in the United States; those used on food requires more than 100 tests to determine a range of potential impacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated [[restricted use pesticide]]s. Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/incentives/auditing/apcol-fifra.pdf|title=Protocol for Conducting Environmental Compliance Audits under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)|date=2011|website=epa.gov|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801031141/http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/incentives/auditing/apcol-fifra.pdf|archive-date=August 1, 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=Dec 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-01/documents/fiframanual.pdf|title=Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Inspection Manual|last=|first=|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|year=2013|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=11–1–11–4|chapter=Ch. 11.

In addition to the EPA, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regulations&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipm.ncsu.edu/safety/factsheets/laws.pdf|title=Federal Pesticide Laws and Regulations|date=Mar 1996|publisher=North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403092424/http://ipm.ncsu.edu/safety/factsheets/laws.pdf|archive-date=April 3, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=Dec 10, 2018|vauthors=Toth SJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/registration.htm|title=Pesticide Registration Program|date=2010|website=Pesticides: Topical &amp; Chemical Fact Sheets|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212233949/http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/registration.htm|archive-date=February 12, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Kaua'i County (Hawai'i) passed Bill No. 2491 to add an article to Chapter 22 of the county's code relating to pesticides and GMOs. The bill strengthens protections of local communities in Kaua'i where many large pesticide companies test their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://media.wix.com/ugd/5f73cf_56e4e700de9ae57e7b709740824bbed4.pdf | title=Bill No. 2491, Draft 2 | publisher = Council of the County of Kaua‘i | date = October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology|date=1987|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0-9678550-9-7|editor-last=McNaught|editor-first=Alan D.|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|chapter=Pesticide Residue|doi=10.1351/goldbook.P04520|oclc=901451465|name-list-style=vanc|postscript=. XML on-line corrected version created by Nic M, Jirat J, Kosata B; updates compiled by Jenkins A.|editor-last2=Wilkinson|editor-first2=Andrew|title-link=IUPAC books#Gold Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum allowable levels of these residues in foods are often stipulated by regulatory bodies in many countries. Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAres&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/eroe/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail.viewInd&amp;lv=list.listByAlpha&amp;r=224028&amp;subtop=312|title=Pesticide Residues in Food|date=Dec 5, 2011|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104075151/http://cfpub.epa.gov/eroe/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail.viewInd&amp;lv=list.listByAlpha&amp;r=224028&amp;subtop=312|archive-date=November 4, 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=Dec 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit [[bioaccumulation]] which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;chlorinatedpest&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Crinnion WJ|date=Dec 2009|title=Chlorinated pesticides: threats to health and importance of detection|journal=Alternative Medicine Review|volume=14|issue=4|pages=347–59|pmid=20030461}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persistent organic pollutant|Persistent chemical]]s can be magnified through the [[food chain]] and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=&quot;fattyfood&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chung SW, Chen BL|date=Aug 2011|title=Determination of organochlorine pesticide residues in fatty foods: a critical review on the analytical methods and their testing capabilities|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=1218|issue=33|pages=5555–67|doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2011.06.066|pmid=21742333|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tripartite Pact''', also known as the '''Berlin Pact''', was an agreement between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] signed in [[Berlin]] on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Galeazzo Ciano]] and [[Saburō Kurusu]]. It was a defensive [[military alliance]] that was eventually joined by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] (20 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (23 November 1940), [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1 March 1941) and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (25 March 1941) as well as by the German client state of [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]] (24 November 1940). [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|Yugoslavia's accession]] provoked a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|''coup d'état'' in Belgrade]] two days later. Germany, Italy and Hungary responded by [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invading Yugoslavia]]. The resulting Italo-German [[client state]], known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]], joined the pact on 15 June 1941.

The Tripartite Pact was, together with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and the [[Pact of Steel]], one of a number of agreements between Germany, Japan, Italy, and other countries of the [[Axis Powers]] governing their relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooke |first1=Tim |title=History of World War II: Volume 1 - Origins and Outbreak |date=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=0761474838 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKDhPHvv_c0C&amp;q=%22Tripartite+pact%22+%22The+axis%22+%22anti-comintern+pact%22&amp;pg=PA154 |accessdate=28 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tripartite Pact was directed primarily at the [[United States]]. Its practical effects were limited since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world, and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. As such the Axis was only ever a loose alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Folly &amp; Palmer1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Folly |first1=Martin |last2=Palmer |first2=Niall |title=The A to Z of U.S. Diplomacy from World War I through World War II |date=20 April 2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-1461672418 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BUiM5yuNcEC&amp;q=%22Tripartite+pact%22+%22The+axis%22+%22anti-comintern+pact%22&amp;pg=PT95 |accessdate=28 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its defensive clauses were never invoked, and signing the agreement did not oblige its signatories to fight a common war ''per se''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tallgren1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tallgren |first1=Immi |title=Martyrs and Scapegoats of the Nation?

Starting in 1995, Mosaic lost market share to [[Netscape Navigator]] and only had a tiny fraction of users left by 1997, when the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed Mosaic to create [[Internet Explorer]] in 1995.

== History ==
[[File:NCSAMosaic1.0Mac.png|thumb|left|Mosaic 1.0 running under [[System 7|System 7.1]], displaying the Mosaic Communications Corporation (later [[Netscape]]) website.]]
After trying ViolaWWW, David Thompson demonstrated it to the NCSA software design group.&lt;ref name=&quot;timbl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|access-date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]] - two programmers working at NCSA - to create Mosaic. Andreessen and Bina originally designed and programmed NCSA Mosaic for Unix's [[X Window System]] called ''xmosaic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mosaic and th w3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timbl&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andreessen+Bina_1994&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Andreessen|first1=Marc|last2=Bina|first2=Eric|title=NCSA Mosaic: A Global Hypermedia System|journal=Internet Research|volume=4|issue=1|pages=7–17|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|location=Bingley, U.K.|year=1994|issn=1066-2243|doi=10.1108/10662249410798803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in December 1991, the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991|Gore Bill]] created and introduced by then Senator and future Vice President [[Al Gore]] was passed, which provided the funding for the Mosaic project. Development began in December 1992. Marc Andreessen announced the project on January 23, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0099.html|title=NCSA X Mosaic 0.5 released|access-date=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first alpha release (numbered 0.1a) was published in June 1993, and the first beta release (numbered 0.6b) followed quickly thereafter in September 1993. Ports to Microsoft Windows and [[Macintosh]] had been released in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;timbl&quot; /&gt; A [[AMosaic|port of Mosaic]] to the [[Commodore Amiga]] was available by October 1993. NCSA Mosaic for Unix (X Window System) version 2.0 was released on November 10, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0447.html|title=NCSA Mosaic for X 2.0 available|access-date=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 1.0 for Microsoft Windows was released on November 11, 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History of NCSA Mosaic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Windows/Archive/MosaicHistory.html|title=The History of NCSA Mosaic|publisher=NCSA}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html |url-status=dead |title=About NCSA Mosaic |publisher=NCSA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927225544/http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html |archive-date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1997, the [[National Science Foundation]] supported the further development of Mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100274|title=Mosaic Launches an Internet Revolution|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Andreessen, the leader of the team that developed Mosaic, left NCSA and, with [[James H. Clark]], one of the founders of [[Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (SGI), and four other former students and staff of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], started Mosaic Communications Corporation. Mosaic Communications eventually became [[Netscape Communications Corporation]], producing [[Netscape Navigator]]. Mosaic's popularity as a separate browser began to decrease after the 1994 release of [[Netscape Navigator]] the relevance of which was noted in ''The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML'': &quot;Netscape Communications has designed an all-new WWW browser Netscape, that has significant enhancements over the original Mosaic program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The HTML Sourcebook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|332}}

In 1994, [[Santa Cruz Operation|SCO]] released Global Access, a modified version of [[SCO OpenServer|SCO's Open Desktop Unix]], which became the first commercial product to incorporate Mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=InfoWorld |title=SCO brings Internet access to PCs |first=Scott |last=Mace |date=7 March 1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1998, the Mosaic user base had almost completely evaporated as users moved to other web browsers.

==Licensing==
The licensing terms for NCSA Mosaic were generous for a proprietary software program. In general, non-commercial use was free of charge for all versions (with certain limitations). Additionally, the X Window System/Unix version publicly provided [[source code]] (source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed). Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, however, Mosaic was never released as [[open source software]] during its brief reign as a major browser; there were always constraints on permissible uses without payment.

{{As of|1993}}, license holders included these:&lt;ref name=&quot;The Second Phase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Wolfe |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic_pr.html|title=The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |volume=2 |page=10 |date=October 1994 |access-date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Robert Reid notes that Andreessen's team hoped:

{{quote| text=... to rectify many of the shortcomings of the very primitive prototypes then floating around the Internet. Most significantly, their work transformed the appeal of the Web from niche uses in the technical area to mass-market appeal. In particular, these University of Illinois students made two key changes to the Web browser, which hyper-boosted its appeal: they added graphics to what was otherwise boring text-based software, and, most importantly, they ported the software from so-called [[Unix]] computers that are popular only in technical and academic circles, to the [Microsoft] Windows operating system, which is used on more than 80 percent of the computers in the world, especially personal and commercial computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architects of the Web&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Robert H. |title=Architects of the Web: 1000 Days That Built the Future of Business |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1997 |isbn=0-471-17187-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/architectsofweb100reid }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxv}}}}

Mosaic is based on the [[libwww]] [[library (computing)|library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahan|first=José|title=Change History of libwww|url=http://www.w3.org/Library/User/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|access-date=30 May 2010|date=7 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petrie|first1=Charles|title=Interview Robert Cailliau on the WWW Proposal: &quot;How It Really Happened.&quot;|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/ic-cailliau|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|access-date=18 August 2010|author-link2=Robert Cailliau|first2=Robert|last2=Cailliau|date=November 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106041256/http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/ic-cailliau|archive-date=6 January 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Libwww?|url=http://www.w3.org/Library/Activity.html|access-date=15 June 2010|date=5 August 1999|first=José|last=Kahan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus supported a wide variety of [[Communications protocol|Internet protocols]] included in the library: [[Archie search engine|Archie]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]], [[telnet]], [[Wide area information server|WAIS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mosaic and th w3&quot; /&gt;

Mosaic is not the first web browser for Microsoft Windows; this is [[Thomas R. Bruce]]'s little-known [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]]. The Unix version of Mosaic was already famous before the Microsoft Windows, Amiga, and Mac versions were released. Other than displaying images embedded in the text (rather than in a separate window), Mosaic's original feature set is similar to the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot; /&gt; But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics reportedly proved immensely appealing. Mosaic is said to have made the Web accessible to the ordinary person for the first time and already had 53% [[Usage share of web browsers|market share]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;CiteSeerX&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cockburn|first1=Andy|title=Which Way Now? Analysing and Easing Inadequacies in WWW Navigation|citeseerx=10.1.1.25.8504|first2=Steve|last2=Jones|date=6 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Impact ==
Mosaic led to the [[Internet boom]] of the 1990s&lt;ref name=&quot;Architects of the Web&quot;/&gt;{{rp|xlii}}. Other browsers existed during this period, such as [[Erwise]], [[ViolaWWW]], [[MidasWWW]], and [[tkWWW]], but did not have the same effect as Mosaic on public use of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ref.web.cern.ch/ref/CERN/CNL/2001/001/www-history/|title=A Little History of the World Wide Web From 1960s to 1995|date=2001-05-05|access-date=2006-12-16|publisher=[[CERN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219114722/http://ref.web.cern.ch/ref/CERN/CNL/2001/001/www-history/|archive-date=2007-12-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 1994 issue of ''Wired'' magazine, Gary Wolfe notes in the article titled &quot;The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun: Don't look now, but [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[AOL]], and [[CompuServe]] are all suddenly obsolete – and Mosaic is well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface&quot;:

{{quote| text=When it comes to smashing a paradigm, pleasure is not the most important thing. It is the only thing. If this sounds wrong, consider Mosaic. Mosaic is the celebrated graphical &quot;browser&quot; that allows users to travel through the world of electronic information using a point-and-click interface. Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext &quot;links&quot; to other documents. By following the links - click, and the linked document appears - you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition. Mosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Second Phase&quot;/&gt;}}

Reid also refers to Matthew K. Gray's website, [https://www.mit.edu/~mkgray/net/ Internet Statistics: Growth and Usage of the Web and the Internet], which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of Mosaic's introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Architects of the Web&quot;/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}

David Hudson concurs with Reid:

{{quote| text=Marc Andreessen's realization of Mosaic, based on the work of [[Tim Berners-Lee|Berners-Lee]] and the hypertext theorists before him, is generally recognized as the beginning of the web as it is now known. Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the Net masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public. The adjective phenomenal, so often overused in this industry, is genuinely applicable to the... 'explosion' in the growth of the web after Mosaic appeared on the scene. Starting with next to nothing, the rates of the web growth (quoted in the press) hovering around tens of thousands of percent over ridiculously short periods of time were no real surprise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rewired&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=David |title=Rewired: A Brief and Opinionated Net History |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Macmillan Technical Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-57870-003-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rewired00huds }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}}}

Ultimately, web browsers such as Mosaic became the ''[[killer application]]s'' of the 1990s. Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the Internet's burgeoning wealth of distributed information services. A mid-1994 guide lists Mosaic alongside the traditional, text-oriented information search tools of the time, [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], and [[Wide area information server|WAIS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucey|first=Sean|title=Internet tools help navigate the busy virtual highway.|journal=MacWeek|date=9 May 1994|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all. Joseph Hardin, the director of the NCSA group within which Mosaic was developed, said downloads were up to 50,000 a month in mid-1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Jason|title=A Matter of Attribution: Can't Forget to Give Credit for Mosaic Where Credit is Due|journal=Open Systems Today|date=9 May 1994|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1992, there were twenty-six websites in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/|title=home of the first website|access-date=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each one attracted attention. In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What's New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by August 1995 and millions by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/ Web Server Survey | Netcraft]. News.netcraft.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Metcalfe expressed the pivotal role of Mosaic this way:

{{quote|
text=
In the Web's first generation, Tim Berners-Lee launched the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and HTML standards with prototype Unix-based servers and browsers. A few people noticed that the Web might be better than Gopher.

In the second generation, Marc Andreessen and [[Eric Bina]] developed NCSA Mosaic at the University of Illinois. Several million then suddenly noticed that the Web might be better than sex.

In the third generation, Andreessen and Bina left NCSA to found Netscape...

== Legacy ==
[[Netscape Navigator]] was later developed by [[Netscape]], which employed many of the original Mosaic authors; however, it intentionally shared no code with Mosaic. Netscape Navigator's code descendant is [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]].&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Jim|title=Netscape Time|url=https://archive.org/details/netscapetimemaki00clar|url-access=registration|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spyglass, Inc.]] licensed the technology and trademarks from NCSA for producing its own web browser but never used any of the NCSA Mosaic source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html |title=Memoirs From the Browser Wars|last=Sink|first=Eric|work=Eric Sink's Weblog|date=2003-05-15|access-date=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] licensed Spyglass Mosaic in 1995 for [[United States dollar|US$]]2 million, modified it, and renamed it [[Internet Explorer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;win&quot; /&gt; After a later auditing dispute, Microsoft paid Spyglass $8 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;win&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/microsoft-and-spyglass-kiss-and-make-up.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919002551/http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/microsoft-and-spyglass-kiss-and-make-up.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 September 2012|title=Microsoft and Spyglass kiss and make up|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|author-link=Paul Thurrott|date=22 January 1997|access-date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/january/new0122d.htm|title=MICROSOFT'S $8 MILLION GOODBYE TO SPYGLASS|access-date=9 February 2011|first=Peter|last=Elstrom|date=22 January 1997|magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 user guide ''The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML'', specifically states, in a section called ''Coming Attractions'', that Internet Explorer &quot;will be based on the Mosaic program&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The HTML Sourcebook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Graham |first=Ian S. |title=The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1995 |edition=First |isbn=0-471-11849-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/htmlsourcebook00grah }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}} Versions of Internet Explorer before [[Internet Explorer 7|version 7]] stated &quot;Based on NCSA Mosaic&quot; in the About box. Internet Explorer 7 was audited by Microsoft to ensure that it contained no Mosaic code,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tedium.co/2015/03/19/the-history-of-internet-explorer-hatred/|title=The History of Internet Explorer Hatred|website=Tedium: The Dull Side of the Internet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus no longer credits Spyglass or Mosaic.

After NCSA stopped work on Mosaic, development of the NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System source code was continued by several independent groups. These independent development efforts include mMosaic (multicast Mosaic)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/9610_Workshop/paper05/paper05.html |title=W3C mMosaic |last=dauphin |first=Gilles |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |year=1996 |access-date=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ceased development in early 2004, and Mosaic-CK and VMS Mosaic.

'''VMS Mosaic''', a version specifically targeting [[OpenVMS]] operating system, is one of the longest-lived efforts to maintain Mosaic. Using the VMS support already built-in in original version (Bjorn S. Nilsson ported Mosaic 1.2 to VMS in the summer of 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/Mosaic/Contrib/README.VMS |title=README.VMS |year=1993 |publisher=National Center for Supercomputing Applications |first=Bjorn |last=Nilsson |access-date=2007-11-02 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; developers incorporated a substantial part of the HTML engine from mMosaic, another defunct flavor of the browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;changehistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wvnvms.wvnet.edu/vmswww/mosaic/versions.html |title=NCSA and VMS Mosaic Version Information |access-date=2012-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121456/http://wvnvms.wvnet.edu/vmswww/mosaic/versions.html |archive-date=2008-07-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2003|9|3|alt=the last (4.2) release}}, VMS Mosaic supported [[HTML]] 4.0, [[OpenSSL]], [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], and various image formats including [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[Truevision TGA|TGA]], [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] and [[JPEG 2000]] image formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openvms.org/stories.php?story=07/09/03/1740114 |title=OpenVMS.org - OpenVMS Community Portal (VMS Mosaic V4.2) |publisher=OpenVMS.org |year=2007 |access-date=2007-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911192043/http://www.openvms.org/stories.php?story=07%2F09%2F03%2F1740114 |archive-date=2007-09-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The browser works on [[VAX]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], and [[Itanium]] platforms.&lt;ref name=VMSMosaic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h71000.www7.hp.com/freeware/freeware80/mosaic40/freeware_readme.txt |year=2006 |title=Mosaic 4.0 freeware_readme.txt |publisher=Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P |access-date=2007-11-02 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another long-lived version, '''Mosaic-CK''', developed by Cameron Kaiser, was last released (version 2.7ck9) on July 11, 2010; a maintenance release with minor compatibility fixes (version 2.7ck10) was released on January 9, 2015, followed by another one (2.7ck11) in October 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;CK&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/machten/mosaic/|title=Floodgap Mosaic-CK: an unsupported updated port of the NCSA Mosaic web browser|website=www.floodgap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated goal of the project is &quot;[[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] with graphics&quot; and runs on Mac OS X, Power [[MachTen]], Linux and other compatible Unix-like [[Operating system|OS]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CK&quot; /&gt;

'''''K-19: The Widowmaker''''' is a 2002 [[historical drama|historical]] [[submarine films|submarine film]] directed and produced by [[Kathryn Bigelow]], and produced by [[Edward S. Feldman]], [[Sigurjón Sighvatsson|Sigurjon Sighvatsson]], Christine Whitaker and Matthias Deyle with screenplay by Christopher Kyle. An international production of the US, UK, Germany and Canada, the film takes place in 1961 and focuses its story on the Soviet [[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19 submarine]].

The film stars [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Liam Neeson]] alongside [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Donald Sumpter]], [[Christian Camargo]], [[Michael Gladis]] and [[John Shrapnel]] in supporting roles.

''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 19, 2002 in the United States while on September 5, 2002 in Germany and October 25, 2002 in the United Kingdom. Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics, which particularly praised the performances and the dramatic atmosphere but criticized the screenwriting. In addition to critical disappointment, the film became a [[box-office bomb]] grossing $65 million against a production budget of $90 million.

==Plot==
In 1961, the [[Soviet Union]] launches its first ballistic missile [[nuclear submarine]], the [[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']], commanded by Captain Alexei Vostrikov ([[Harrison Ford]]), with [[executive officer]] Mikhail Polenin ([[Liam Neeson]]), the crew's original captain. Vostrikov is alleged to have been appointed through his wife's political connections, as well as Polenin's tendency to put crew morale and safety before Soviet pride. Discovering the reactor officer drunk and asleep on duty, Vostrikov fires him, receiving a replacement, Vadim Radtchenko ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), fresh from the academy. Bad luck surrounds the launch; the medical officer is killed by a truck and replaced by command's foremost medical officer, who has never been out to sea, and the inaugural bottle of champagne fails to break on the bow.

The ''K-19'''s first mission is to surface in the Arctic, test-fire an unarmed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], and patrol the Atlantic within striking range of [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. Vostrikov orders ''K-19'' to submerge past its maximum operational depth, then surface at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice. Protesting the dangerous maneuver, Polenin storms off the bridge. The test missile launches successfully.

En route to the patrol zone, a [[Nuclear reactor#Cooling|reactor coolant]] pipe bursts. Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but reactor temperature rises and the crew learns back-up coolant systems were not installed. ''K-19'' surfaces to contact fleet command but the long-range transmitter antenna cable is damaged, possibly by the Arctic maneuver. Engineers rig a makeshift coolant system, working in shifts to limit radiation exposure. The first team emerges vomiting and blistered; the second and third teams cool the reactor, but all suffer [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]. With radiation levels rising, the submarine surfaces and most of the crew are ordered topside. Radtchenko balks after seeing the first team's injuries, and the [[Glavny starshina|crew chief]] takes his place on the third team.

A [[Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw]] helicopter from a nearby [[United States Navy]] [[destroyer]] offers assistance, which Vostrikov rejects. The Soviet government grows concerned when the ''K-19'' ceases contact but is spotted near the destroyer. Hoping diesel submarines will be sent to tow the ''K-19'', Vostrikov orders a return to port, but the pace could kill the entire crew. The repaired pipework leaks and reactor temperature rises again, and torpedo fuel ignites a fire. Initially ordering the fire suppression system activated – which would suffocate anyone in the area – Vostrikov is talked down by Polenin, who personally assists the fire crew. Two officers mutiny against Vostrikov, and Radtchenko enters the reactor alone to attempt repairs.

Polenin deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons, arrests them, and frees Vostrikov. Unaware of Radtchenko, Vostrikov, at Polenin's behest, announces his plan to dive and attempt another repair, fearing an overheating reactor could set off their warheads and incite nuclear war. The crew responds positively, and ''K-19'' dives. Radtchenko's repairs are successful, but blind and weakened by heavy radiation, he is dragged out by Vostrikov. A meltdown is prevented, but irradiated steam leaks throughout the submarine.

A Soviet diesel submarine reaches ''K-19'', with orders to confine the crew on-board until a freighter can pick them up, but as it is too dangerous to stay, Vostrikov orders an evacuation, knowing he may lose his command and be sent to a [[gulag]]. Returning to the Soviet Union, Vostrikov is tried for endangering the mission and disobeying a direct order, but Polenin comes to his defense.

An epilogue reveals Vostrikov was acquitted, but the ''K-19'' crew was sworn to secrecy and Vostrikov never given submarine command again. All seven men who went into the reactor chamber died of radiation poisoning, and twenty others later died from radiation sickness. Only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union decades later could the crew discuss what happened.

In 1989, an aged Vostrikov meets Polenin and other survivors at a cemetery on the anniversary of their rescue. Vostrikov informs the men that he nominated the 28 deceased crewmen for the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award, but was told the honor was reserved for combat veterans. Remarking &quot;what good are honors from such people,&quot; Vostrikov toasts the survivors and those who sacrificed their lives.

&quot;The Widowmaker&quot; nickname was used only in the film. In real life, the submarine had no nickname until the nuclear accident on July 3, 1961, when it received the nickname &quot;Hiroshima&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huchthausen 2002, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was filmed in [[Canada]], specifically [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; [[Gimli, Manitoba]]; and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

The producers made some efforts to work with the original crew of ''K-19'', who took exception to the first version of the script available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Gentleman, Amelia.

In a later script, several scenes were cut, and the names of the crew changed at the request of the crew members and their families.

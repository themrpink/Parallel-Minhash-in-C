      <text bytes="7022" xml:space="preserve">In [[nuclear strategy]], '''minimal deterrence''' (also called '''minimum deterrence''') is an application of [[deterrence theory]] in which a state possesses no more [[nuclear weapons]] than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;KristensenNorrisOelrich-p21&quot;&gt;Kristensen, Norris and Oelrich 2009, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Pure minimal deterrence is a doctrine of [[no first use]], holding that the only mission of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear adversary by making the cost of a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] unacceptably high.&lt;ref name=&quot;KristensenNorrisOelrich-p21&quot; /&gt;  To present a credible deterrent, there must be the assurance that any attack would trigger a retaliatory strike.&lt;ref&gt;Lieber and Press 2006, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, minimal deterrence requires rejecting a [[counterforce]] strategy in favor of pursuing survivable force that can be used in a [[countervalue]] [[second strike]].

While the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each developed robust first- and second-strike capabilities during the [[Cold War]], the [[People's Republic of China]] pursued a doctrine of minimal nuclear deterrence.  Assuming that decision-makers make cost-benefit analyses when deciding to use force, China's doctrine calls for acquiring a nuclear arsenal only large enough to destroy an adversary's &quot;strategic points&quot; in such a way that the expected costs of a first strike outweigh the anticipated benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 2002, 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] has also adopted this strategy, which they term [[Minimum Credible Deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Feickert and Kronstadt 2003, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minimum Credible Deterrence''' ('''MCD'''; officially named '''N-deterrence'''), is a defence and [[Strategic studies|strategic]] principle on which the [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic weapons programme]] of Pakistan is based. This doctrine is not a part of the [[Nuclear doctrine of Pakistan|nuclear doctrine]], which is designed for the use of the atomic weapons in a full-scale [[declared war]] if the conditions of the doctrine are surpassed. Instead, the policy of the Minimum Credible Deterrence falls under [[minimal deterrence]] as an inverse to the [[Mutually assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), which is widely regarded as designed to dissuade India from taking any military actions against Pakistan, as it did in 1971, when Pakistan started the war. Pakistan refuses to adopt [[No first use]] policy, while the other regional powers [[India]] and [[China]] had adopted the policy. Pakistan's foreign minister [[Shamshad Ahmad]] had warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use &quot;any weapon in its arsenal&quot; to defend itself.

Minimal deterrence represents one way of solving the [[security dilemma]] and avoiding an [[arms race]].  Decision-makers often feel pressured to expand their arsenals when they perceive them to be vulnerable to an adversary's first strike, especially when both sides seek to achieve the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman 2003, 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliminating this perceived vulnerability reduces the incentive to produce more and advanced weapons.  For example, the United States’ nuclear force exceeds the requirements of minimal deterrence, and is structured to strike numerous targets in multiple countries and to have the ability to conduct successful counterforce strikes with high confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen, Norris and Oelrich 2009, 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this, China continues to modernize its nuclear forces because its leaders are concerned about the survivability of their arsenal in the face of the United States’ advances in strategic reconnaissance, precision strike, and [[missile defense]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair 2009, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of minimal deterrence is that it requires an accurate understanding of the level of damage an adversary finds unacceptable, especially if that understanding changes over time so that a previously credible deterrent is no longer credible.&lt;ref&gt;Stout 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A minimal deterrence strategy must also account for the nuclear firepower that would be &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;neutralized&quot; during an adversary's counterforce strike.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman 2003, 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a minimal deterrence capability may embolden a state when it confronts a superior nuclear power, as has been observed in the relationship between China and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McVadon 2005, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, while pursuing minimal deterrence during arms negotiations allows states to make reductions without becoming vulnerable, further reductions may be undesirable once minimal deterrence is reached because they will increase a state's vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to secretly expand its nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Nalebuff 1988, 424&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2441" xml:space="preserve">In [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]], '''clanging''' refers to a mode of speech characterized by association of words based upon sound rather than concepts. For example, this may include compulsive [[rhyme|rhyming]] or [[alliteration]] without apparent logical connection between words. This is associated with the irregular thinking apparent in [[psychosis|psychotic]] [[mental illness]]es (e.g. [[mania]] and [[schizophrenia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peralta |first1=Victor |last2=Cuesta |first2=Manuel J. |last3=de Leon |first3=Jose |title=Formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: A factor analytic study|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |date=March 1992 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=105–110 |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(92)90005-B |pmid=1544294}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Aschaffenburg]] found that manic individuals generated these &quot;clang-associations&quot; roughly 10–50 times more than non-manic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraepelin|first1=Emil|title=Manic-depressive insanity and paranoia|url=https://archive.org/details/manicdepressivei00krae|date=1921|publisher=E. &amp; S.

Clanging refers specifically to behavior that is situationally inappropriate. While a poet rhyming is not evidence of mental illness, disorganized speech that impedes the patient's ability to communicate is a disorder in itself, often seen in schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Covington MA, He C, Brown C, Naçi L, McClain JT, Fjordbak BS, Semple J, Brown J |date=Sep 2005 |title=Schizophrenia and the structure of language: the linguist's view |url= http://www.ai.uga.edu/caspr/litreviewsr-published.pdf|journal=Schizophr.

'''Mutually assured destruction''' ('''MAD''') is a [[doctrine]] of [[military strategy]] and [[national security|national security policy]] in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapon]]s by two or more opposing sides would cause the [[nuclear holocaust|complete annihilation]] of both the attacker and the defender (see [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] and [[second strike]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm Mutual Assured Destruction]; Col. Alan J. Parrington, USAF, [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html |date=2015-06-20 }}, Airpower Journal, Winter 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theory of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]], which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of [[Nash equilibrium]] in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

The term &quot;mutual assured destruction&quot; was coined by Donald Brennan, a strategist working in [[Herman Kahn]]'s [[Hudson Institute]] in  1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Whole earth security : a geopolitics of peace|last=Daniel.|first=Deudney|date=1983|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|isbn=978-0916468545|location=Washington|pages=80|oclc=9833320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{more footnotes|section|date=October 2013}}
Under MAD, each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side. Either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate, irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants' mutual, total, and [[assured destruction]]. The doctrine requires that neither side construct shelters on a massive scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17026538|title=How did we forget about mutually assured destruction?|last=Castella|first=Tom de|date=2012-02-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one side constructed a similar system of shelters, it would violate the MAD doctrine and destabilize the situation, because it would have less to fear from a [[second strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Disturbing the Universe'', Chapter 13, ''The Ethics of Defense'', Basic Books, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Weapons and Hope'', Freeman Dyson, Harper Collins, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The same principle is invoked against [[missile defense]].

The doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] because the other side would [[launch on warning]] (also called [[fail-deadly]]) or with surviving forces (a [[second strike]]), resulting in unacceptable losses for both parties. The payoff of the MAD doctrine was and still is expected to be a tense but stable global peace.

The primary application of this doctrine started during the [[Cold War]] (1940s to 1991), in which MAD was seen as helping to prevent any direct full-scale conflicts between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] while they engaged in smaller [[proxy war]]s around the world. It was also responsible for the [[arms race]], as both nations struggled to keep nuclear parity, or at least retain [[second-strike capability]]. Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the MAD doctrine continues to be applied.

Proponents of MAD as part of the US and [[USSR]] strategic doctrine believed that [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full-scale nuclear exchange as a functioning state. Since the credibility of the threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial [[capital (economics)|capital]] in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other's nuclear missiles.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  This led both to the hardening and diversification of nuclear delivery systems (such as nuclear [[missile silo]]s, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, and nuclear [[bomber]]s kept at [[fail-safe]] points) and to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]].

This MAD scenario is often referred to as [[strategic deterrence|nuclear deterrence]]. The term &quot;deterrence&quot; is now used in this context;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary.|date=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|others=Simpson, J. A., 1953–, Weiner, E. S.

==History==

===Pre-1945===

The concept of MAD had been discussed in the literature for nearly a century before the invention of nuclear weapons. One of the earliest references comes from the English author [[Wilkie Collins]], writing at the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870: &quot;I begin to believe in only one civilizing influence—the discovery one of these days of a destructive agent so terrible that War shall mean annihilation and men's fears will force them to keep the peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wilkiecollinssociety.org/newsletter-spring-2009/ | title=Wilkie Collins and Mutually Assured Destruction | publisher=The Wilkie Collins Society | date=Spring 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was also described in 1863 by [[Jules Verne]] in his novel ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'', though it was not published until 1994. The book is set in 1960 and describes &quot;the engines of war&quot;, which have become so efficient that war is inconceivable and all countries are at a perpetual stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paris in the twentieth century|last=1828-1905.|first=Verne, Jules|date=1996|publisher=Random House|others=Howard, Richard, 1929-|isbn=0679444343|edition= 1st US |location=New York|oclc=32854161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=February 2019}}

MAD has been invoked by more than one weapons inventor. For example, [[Richard Jordan Gatling]] patented his namesake [[Gatling gun]] in 1862 with the partial intention of illustrating the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wahl and Don Toppel, ''The Gatling Gun'', Arco Publishing, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, after his 1867 invention of [[dynamite]], Alfred Nobel stated that &quot;the day when two army corps can annihilate each other in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/medicaladvancesissues/a/nobelhistory.htm|title=Everything You Need to Know About the First Nobel Prizes|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, [[Nikola Tesla]] published ''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media'',&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola, [http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/teleforce.htm ''The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense]'', circa 16 May 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise concerning [[charged particle beam]] weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seifer454&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described his device as a &quot;superweapon that would put an end to all war.&quot;

The March 1940 [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]], the earliest technical exposition of a practical nuclear weapon, anticipated deterrence as the principal means of combating an enemy with nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Andrew|last2=Arnold|first2=Lorna|date=2010-09-20|title=The Quirks of Nuclear Deterrence|journal=International Relations|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=293–312|doi=10.1177/0047117810377278|s2cid=143594540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Cold War===
[[File: Atomic bombing of Japan.jpg|thumb|right|Atomic bomb explosions over Hiroshima, Japan, 6 August 1945 (left) and over Nagasaki, Japan, 9 August 1945 (right).]]
In August 1945, the United States became the first nuclear power after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union [[RDS-1|detonated its own nuclear device]]. At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other. However, with the development of aircraft like the American [[Convair B-36]] and the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95]], both sides were gaining a greater ability to deliver nuclear weapons into the interior of the opposing country. The official policy of the United States became one of &quot;[[massive retaliation]]&quot;, as coined by Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], which called for massive attack against the Soviet Union if they were to invade Europe, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear attack.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

By the time of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed the capability of launching a nuclear-tipped missile from a submerged submarine, which completed the &quot;third leg&quot; of the [[nuclear triad]] weapons strategy necessary to fully implement the MAD doctrine. Having a three-branched nuclear capability eliminated the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation's nuclear forces in a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first-strike]] attack; this, in turn, ensured the credible threat of a devastating [[second strike|retaliatory strike]] against the aggressor, increasing a nation's [[nuclear deterrence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NW&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |author=John Barry |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/226494 |title=Do We Still Need a Nuclear 'Triad'? |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/USNuclearDeterrence.html |title=Nuclear Stockpile |publisher=US Department of Defense |author=Office for the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters |accessdate=2010-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015329/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/USNuclearDeterrence.html |archivedate=2010-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959948,00.html |title=Toning Up the Nuclear Triad |magazine=Time |date=1985-09-23 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (Soviet leader 1953 to 1964) decided that policies that facilitated nuclear war were too dangerous to the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war.&lt;ref&gt; Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko, &quot;MAD, not Marx: Khrushchev and the nuclear revolution.&quot; ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (2018) 41#1/2:208-233. &lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1955, the United States [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) kept one-third of its bombers on alert, with crews ready to take off within fifteen minutes and fly to designated targets inside the [[Soviet Union]] and destroy them with nuclear bombs in the event of a Soviet first-strike attack on the United States. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy increased funding for this program and raised the commitment to 50 percent of SAC aircraft.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

During periods of increased tension in the early 1960s, SAC kept part of its B-52 fleet airborne at all times, to allow an extremely fast retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union in the event of a surprise attack on the United States. This program continued until 1969. Between 1954 and 1992, bomber wings had approximately one-third of their assigned aircraft on quick reaction ground alert and were able to take off within a few minutes.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} SAC also maintained the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced &quot;kneecap&quot;), also known as &quot;Looking Glass&quot;, which consisted of several EC-135s, one of which was airborne at all times from 1961 through 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] the bombers were dispersed to several different airfields, and also were sometimes airborne. For example, some were sent to [[Wright Patterson]], which normally did not have B-52s.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}}

During the height of the tensions between the US and the USSR in the 1960s, two popular films were made dealing with what could go terribly wrong with the policy of keeping nuclear-bomb-carrying airplanes at the ready: ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tvovermind.com/movies/50-years-later-2001-a-space-odyssey-is-still-an-unparalleled-marvel-on-the-big-screen |title=50 Years Later, '2001: A Space Odyssey' Is Still an Unparalleled Marvel on the Big Screen |date=2018-08-31 |work=TVOvermind |access-date=2018-09-15 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gerald-hirschfeld-dead-young-frankenstein-fail-safe-cinematographer-was-95-977763 |title=Gerald Hirschfeld, Cinematographer on 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Fail-Safe,' Dies at 95 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2018-09-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retaliation capability (second strike)===
{{see also|Second strike}}
[[File:Robert McNamara official portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Robert McNamara]]]]
The strategy of MAD was fully declared in the early 1960s, primarily by United States Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]]. In McNamara's formulation, there was the very real danger that a nation with nuclear weapons could attempt to eliminate another nation's retaliatory forces with a surprise, devastating the first strike and theoretically &quot;win&quot; a nuclear war relatively unharmed. The true second-strike capability could be achieved only when a nation had a ''guaranteed'' ability to fully retaliate after a first-strike attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The United States had achieved an early form of second-strike capability by fielding continual patrols of strategic nuclear bombers, with a large number of planes always in the air, on their way to or from fail-safe points close to the borders of the Soviet Union. This meant the United States could still retaliate, even after a devastating first-strike attack. The tactic was expensive and problematic because of the high cost of keeping enough planes in the air at all times and the possibility they would be shot down by Soviet [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s before reaching their targets. In addition, as the idea of a [[missile gap]] existing between the US and the Soviet Union developed, there was increasing priority being given to [[ICBM]]s over bombers.

It was only with the advent of [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, starting with the [[George Washington class submarine|'' George Washington'' class]] in 1959, that a genuine [[Survivability|survivable]] nuclear force became possible and a retaliatory second strike capability guaranteed.

The deployment of fleets of ballistic missile submarines established a guaranteed second-strike capability because of their stealth and by the number fielded by each Cold War adversary—it was highly unlikely that all of them could be targeted and preemptively destroyed (in contrast to, for example, a missile silo with a fixed location that could be targeted during a first strike). Given their long-range, high [[survivability]] and ability to carry many medium- and long-range nuclear missiles, submarines were credible and effective means for full-scale retaliation even after a massive first strike.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This deterrence strategy and the program have continued into the 21st century, with nuclear submarines carrying [[Trident II]] ballistic missiles as one leg of the US [[strategic deterrence|strategic nuclear deterrent]] and as the sole deterrent of the United Kingdom. The other elements of the US deterrent are intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on alert in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers. Ballistic missile submarines are also operated by the navies of China, France, India, and Russia.

=== ABMs threaten MAD ===
{{main|Anti-ballistic missile}}
In the 1960s both the Soviet Union ([[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]]) and the United States ([[LIM-49 Nike Zeus]]) developed anti-ballistic missile systems. Had such systems been able to effectively defend against a retaliatory [[second strike]], MAD would have been undermined. See also [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===MIRVs===

[[File:Peacekeeper RV vehicles.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A time exposure of seven [[multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle|MIRVs]] from [[Peacekeeper missile]] passing through clouds]]

==== MIRVs as counter against ABM ====
The [[multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle]] (MIRV) was another weapons system designed specifically to aid with the MAD nuclear deterrence doctrine. With a MIRV payload, one [[ICBM]] could hold many separate warheads. MIRVs were first created by the United States in order to counterbalance the Soviet [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]]s around Moscow. Since each defensive missile could be counted on to destroy only one offensive missile, making each offensive missile have, for example, three warheads (as with early MIRV systems) meant that three times as many defensive missiles were needed for each offensive missile. This made defending against missile attacks more costly and difficult. One of the largest US MIRVed missiles, the [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper]], could hold up to 10 warheads, each with a yield of around {{convert|300|ktonTNT|PJ|lk=in}}—all together, an explosive payload equivalent to 230 [[Little Boy|Hiroshima-type]] bombs. The multiple warheads made defense untenable with the available technology, leaving the threat of retaliatory attack as the only viable defensive option. MIRVed land-based ICBMs tend to put a premium on striking first.&lt;!--For example, assume that each side has 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo. In this case, the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. --&gt; The [[START II]] agreement was proposed to ban this type of weapon, but never entered into force.

In the event of a Soviet conventional attack on [[Western Europe]], [[NATO]] planned to use [[tactical nuclear weapons]]. The Soviet Union countered this threat by issuing a statement that any use of nuclear weapons (tactical or otherwise) against Soviet forces would be grounds for a full-scale Soviet retaliatory strike ([[massive retaliation]]). Thus it was generally assumed that any combat in Europe would end with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] conclusions.
{{-}}

==== Land-based MIRVed ICBMs threaten MAD ====

[[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRVed]] land-based ICBMs are generally considered suitable for a first strike (inherently [[counterforce]]) or a counterforce [[second strike]], due to:
# Their high accuracy (low [[circular error probable]]), compared to submarine-launched ballistic missiles which used to be less accurate, and more prone to defects;
# Their fast response time, compared to bombers which are considered too slow;
# Their ability to carry multiple MIRV warheads at once, useful for destroying a whole missile field or several cities with one missile.

Unlike a [[decapitation strike]] or a [[countervalue strike]], a [[counterforce strike]] might result in a potentially more constrained retaliation. Though the Minuteman III of the mid-1960s was MIRVed with three warheads, heavily MIRVed vehicles threatened to upset the balance; these included the [[SS-18 Satan]] which was deployed in 1976, and was considered to threaten [[Minuteman III]] silos, which led [[Team B|some]] [[neoconservatives]] to conclude a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] first strike was being prepared for. This led to the development of the aforementioned [[Pershing II]], the [[Trident I]] and [[Trident II]], as well as the [[MX missile]], and the [[B-1 Lancer]].

MIRVed land-based [[ICBM]]s are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. When a missile is MIRVed, it is able to carry many [[warhead]]s (up to eight in existing US missiles, limited by [[New START]], though Trident II is capable of carrying up to 12&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://missilethreat.com/missiles/ugm-133-trident-d-5/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027084659/http://missilethreat.com/missiles/ugm-133-trident-d-5/ |archive-date=2015-10-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and deliver them to separate targets. If it is assumed that each side has 100 missiles, with five warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing two warheads at each silo, then the attacking side can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about five by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. As such, this type of weapon was intended to be banned under the [[START II]] agreement; however, the START II agreement was never brought into force, and neither Russia nor the United States ratified the agreement.

===Late Cold War===
The original US MAD doctrine was modified on July 25, 1980, with US President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s adoption of ''countervailing strategy'' with [[National security directive|Presidential Directive]]&amp;nbsp;59. According to its architect, Secretary of Defense [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], &quot;countervailing strategy&quot; stressed that the planned response to a Soviet attack was no longer to bomb Soviet population centers and cities primarily, but first to kill the Soviet leadership, then attack military targets, in the hope of a Soviet surrender before total destruction of the Soviet Union (and the United States). This modified version of MAD was seen as a winnable nuclear war, while still maintaining the possibility of assured destruction for at least one party. This policy was further developed by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] with the announcement of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI, nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot;), the goal of which was to develop space-based technology to destroy Soviet missiles before they reached the United States.

===Hypnosis===
Declassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied [[hypnosis]] in the early 1950s. Experimental goals included the creation of &quot;hypnotically induced [[anxiety|anxieties]],&quot; &quot;hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter,&quot; studying hypnosis and [[polygraph]] examinations, &quot;hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects&quot; and studying &quot;relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c078.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020428104652/http://www.michael-robinett.com/declass/c078.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-04-28 |title=Declassified |publisher=Michael-robinett.com |access-date=2010-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with [[anterograde amnesia|anterograde]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] while under the influence of such drugs.

==Experiments on Canadians==
[[File:Donald Ewen Cameron canmedaj01237-0046-a.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Donald Ewen Cameron {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1967]]
The CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited British psychiatrist [[Donald Ewen Cameron]], creator of the &quot;[[psychic driving]]&quot; concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from [[Albany, New York]] to [[Montreal]] every week to work at the [[Allan Memorial Institute]] of [[McGill University]], and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (which would be US$558,915 in 2018, adjusting for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there, the [[Montreal experiments]]. These research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA.&lt;ref name=Marks1979&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |year=1979 |title=The Search for the Manchurian Candidate |pages=140–150 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |isbn=0812907736 |url=https://archive.org/details/searchformanchur00john/page/141}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=[https://archive.org/details/searchformanchur00john/page/141 141–142]}}

In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as [[electroconvulsive therapy]] at thirty to forty times the normal power. His &quot;driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing [[tape loop]]s of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions.&lt;ref name=Marks1979/&gt;{{rp|pages=[https://archive.org/details/searchformanchur00john/page/140 140–150]}} His treatments resulted in victims' [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[amnesia]], forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators were their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turbide |first=Diane |date=1997-04-21 |title=Dr.&amp;nbsp;Cameron's casualties |url=http://www.ect.org/dr-camerons-casualties/ |website=ect.org |access-date=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] as well as president of the [[American Psychiatric Association|American]] and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron was also a member of the [[Nuremberg medical tribunal]] in 1946–1947.&lt;ref name=Marks1979/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://archive.org/details/searchformanchur00john/page/141 141]}}

===Motivation and assessments===
His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist [[William Sargant]] at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Anne |orig-year=1988 |year=1998 |title=In the Sleep Room: The story of CIA brainwashing experiments in Canada |publisher=Key Porter Books |location=Toronto |pages=39, 42–43, 133 |isbn=1550139320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, several of Cameron's former patients sued the CIA for damages, which the Canadian news program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV series)|The Fifth Estate]]'' documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MK Ultra episodes |series=40&amp;nbsp;years of ''The Fifth Estate'' |website=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/40-years-of-the-fifth-estate/mk-ultra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiences and lawsuit was made into a 1998 television miniseries called [[The Sleep Room (1998 film)|''The Sleep Room'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sleep Room at IMDB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138104/ |title=The Sleep Room |date=31 March 1998 |website=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naomi Klein]] argues in her book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing &quot;a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources'. In other words, torture.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shock&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=N. |author-link=Naomi Klein |year=2007 |title=The Shock Doctrine |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=978-0676978018 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0KIy92V58wC&amp;pg=PA37 |via=Google Books |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C0KIy92V58wC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 39–41]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred W. McCoy]] writes, &quot;Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Dr. Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method&quot;,&lt;ref name=McCoy2006/&gt; referring to first creating a state of disorientation in the subject, and then creating a situation of &quot;self-inflicted&quot; discomfort in which the disoriented subject can alleviate their pain by capitulating.&lt;ref name=McCoy2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCoy |first=Alfred |author-link=Alfred W.

==Secret detention camps==
In areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, Germany and the [[Philippines]], the CIA created secret detention centers so that the U.S. could avoid criminal prosecution. The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed &quot;expendable&quot; to undertake various types of torture and human experimentation on them. The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr.org&quot;/&gt;

==Revelation==
[[File:FrankChurch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Frank Church]] headed the Church Committee, an investigation into the practices of the US intelligence agencies.]]
In 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by [[Watergate]], CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] ordered all MKUltra files destroyed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news |title=Mind Control: My Mother, the CIA and LSD |author=Elizabeth Nickson |newspaper=The Observer |date=October 16, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms' purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

In December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' alleged that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/huge-cia-operation-reported-in-u-s-against-antiwar-forces-other.html|title=Huge C.i.a.

In the summer of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] report revealed to the public for the first time that the CIA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as LSD and [[mescaline]] and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, [[Frank Olson]] had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;parascope.com&quot;&gt;
[http://www.parascope.com/ds/documentslibrary/documents/mkultrahearing/mkultraHearing02.htm Prepared Statement of Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of Central Intelligence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526151923/http://www.parascope.com/ds/documentslibrary/documents/mkultrahearing/mkultraHearing02.htm |date=2006-05-26 }}. ParaScope.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously and had headed MKUltra, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;

The congressional committee investigating the CIA research, chaired by Senator [[Frank Church]], concluded that &quot;prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects&quot;. The committee noted that the &quot;experiments sponsored by these researchers ... call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.&quot;

Following the recommendations of the Church Committee, President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited &quot;experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject&quot; and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

[[File:ProjectMKULTRA Senate Report.pdf|thumb|1977 United States Senate report on MKUltra]]
In 1977, during a hearing held by the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], to look further into MKUltra, Admiral [[Stansfield Turner]], then Director of Central Intelligence, revealed that the CIA had found a set of records, consisting of about 20,000 pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://todayinclh.com/?event=cia-director-admits-documents-on-drug-experiments-destroyed|title=CIA Director Admits Documents on Secret Drug Experiments Destroyed|last=Tourek|first=Mary|date=2013-08-02|website=Today in Civil Liberties History|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had survived the 1973 destruction orders because they had been incorrectly stored at a records center not usually used for such documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;parascope.com&quot;/&gt; These files dealt with the financing of MKUltra projects and contained few project details, but much more was learned from them than from the Inspector General's 1963 report.

On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Deputy Director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an &quot;extensive testing and experimentation&quot; program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens &quot;at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign.&quot; Several of these tests involved the administration of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to &quot;unwitting subjects in social situations.{{cite quote|date=April 2020}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least one death, the result of the [[defenestration]] of Dr. [[Frank Olson]], was attributed to Olson's being subjected, unaware, to such experimentation, nine days before his death. The CIA itself subsequently acknowledged that these tests had little scientific rationale. The agents conducting the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/Hearing01.htm | title = Opening Remarks by Senator Ted Kennedy | date = 1977-08-03 | work = U.S. Senate Select Committee On Intelligence, and Subcommittee On Health And Scientific Research of the Committee On Human Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What did the C.I.A. do to Eric Olson's father?|date=April 1, 2001|author=Ignatieff, Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/magazine/01OLSON.html|work=The New York Times Magazine|access-date=13 January 2017|author-link=Michael Ignatieff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the issue took much longer to surface, becoming widely known in 1984 on a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] news show, ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''. It was learned that not only had the CIA funded [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Dr. Cameron]]'s efforts, but also that the Canadian government was fully aware of this, and had later provided another $500,000 in funding to continue the experiments. This revelation largely derailed efforts by the victims to sue the CIA as their U.S. counterparts had, and the Canadian government eventually settled out of court for $100,000 to each of the 127 victims. Dr. Cameron died on September 8, 1967, after suffering a heart attack while he and his son were mountain climbing. None of Cameron's personal records of his involvement with MKUltra survived, since his family destroyed them after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyonair.com/?s=mkultra |title=Podcast 98 – MKUltra |publisher=HistoryOnAir.com |date=2005-06-16 |access-date=2013-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221320/http://historyonair.com/?s=mkultra |archive-date=2015-06-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/stunning-tale-of-brainwashing-the-cia-and-an-unsuspecting-scots-researcher-1-466144 Stunning tale of brainwashing, the CIA and an unsuspecting Scots researcher], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', January 5, 2006.

===1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report===
The U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Working with the CIA, the Department of Defense gave hallucinogenic drugs to thousands of &quot;volunteer&quot; soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to LSD, the Army also tested [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|quinuclidinyl benzilate]], a hallucinogen code-named [[3-quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]]. (Note 37) Many of these tests were conducted under the so-called MKULTRA program, established to counter perceived Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing techniques. Between 1953 and 1964, the program consisted of 149 projects involving drug testing and other studies on unwitting human subjects&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Deaths==
Given the CIA's purposeful destruction of most records, its failure to follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, and the lack of follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Supremecourt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arts.rpi.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;many other unofficial sites&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=albarelli&gt;{{cite book |author=H.

Several known deaths have been associated with Project MKUltra, most notably that of [[Frank Olson]]. Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and died by suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.&lt;ref name=&quot;olson&quot;/&gt;

The Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |title=The Olson File |publisher=Frankolsonproject.org |access-date=2012-12-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010804055955/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |archive-date=2001-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research. Among Olson's concerns were the development of assassination materials used by the CIA, the CIA's use of biological warfare materials in covert operations, experimentation with biological weapons in populated areas, collaboration with former [[Nazi human experimentation|scientists]] under [[Operation Paperclip]], LSD mind-control research, and the use of psychoactive drugs during &quot;terminal&quot; interrogations under a program code-named [[Project ARTICHOKE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030211052410/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html | url-status=dead | archive-date = 2003-02-11 | last = Olson | first = E | title = Family Statement on the Murder of Frank Olson | access-date = 2008-10-16 | date = 2002-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later forensic evidence conflicted with the official version of events; when Olson's body was exhumed in 1994, cranial injuries indicated that Olson had been knocked unconscious before he exited the window.&lt;ref name=&quot;olson&quot;&gt;Marks 1979: chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The medical examiner termed Olson's death a &quot;homicide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ronson | first = Jon | title = The Men Who Stare at Goats | publisher = [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] | year = 2004 | location = New York | isbn = 0330375482 | url = https://archive.org/details/menwhostareatgoa00rons_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Olson's family received a $750,000 settlement from the U.S. government and formal apologies from President [[Gerald Ford]] and CIA Director [[William Colby]], though their apologies were limited to informed consent issues concerning Olson's ingestion of LSD.&lt;ref name=albarelli/&gt; On 28 November 2012, the Olson family filed suit against the U.S. federal government for the wrongful death of Frank Olson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTISTS_DEATH_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-28-16-47-42|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232401/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCIENTISTS_DEATH_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-11-28-16-47-42|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-01|title=News from The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed in July 2013, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaines |first=Danielle |title=Lawsuit by family of drugged Detrick employee dismissed |url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/crime_and_justice/article_8705f623-edfd-59b0-9e04-548b15a2c423.html?TNNoMobile |access-date=October 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[Frederick News-Post]] |date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decision dismissing the suit, [[U.S. District Judge]] [[James Boasberg]] wrote, &quot;While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schoenberg |first=Tom |title=CIA Cover-Up Suit Over Scientist's Fatal Fall Dismissed |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-17/cia-cover-up-suit-over-scientist-s-fatal-fall-dismissed.html |access-date=February 22, 2014 |website=Bloomberg News |date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues involving informed consent==
The revelations about the CIA and the army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.

Previously, the CIA and the army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under the [[Feres doctrine]].

In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5–4 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority argued that &quot;a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.&quot; In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects.... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |title=Ritchie v.

==Aftermath==
After retiring in 1972, Gottlieb dismissed his entire effort for the CIA's MKUltra program as useless.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sidney Gottlieb |newspaper=The Times (London)|date=March 12, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA insists that MKUltra-type experiments have been abandoned, but Canadian investigative journalist [[Elizabeth Nickson]] (whose mother was a subject) claims that they continue today under a different name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; Nickson's mother, Virginia Elizabeth Hooker, was admitted to [[Allan Memorial Institute]] for anxiety after miscarrying during her first pregnancy. There, [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewan Cameron]] served as Hooker's psychiatrist. Her anxiety was cured by insulin, and she returned home. Eight years later Hooker's anxiety recurred and she was readmitted to Allan Memorial and placed under Cameron's care. Nickson claims that Cameron experimented with gaining access to Hooker's behavior rather than treating any mental illness. Psychiatric reports suggest that shock treatments were tested on Hooker. It is also alleged that Cameron attempted surgery to rewire Hooker's brain and drugged her with [[Promazine|Sparine]], a drug known to impair the human immune system that has since been discontinued. After 17 years of treatment with Cameron, Hooker was sent home. She died in January 2020.

'''Margaret Thaler Singer''' (July 29, 1921 – November 23, 2003) was an American [[clinical psychologist]] and researcher with her colleague [[Lyman Wynne]] of family communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isps.org/index.php/isps-membership/isps-honorary-members/item/56-lyman-wynne|title=Lyman Wynne|work=isps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a prominent figure in the study of undue influence in social and religious contexts.

Cromwell also had an illegitimate daughter, Jane (c. 1530/5{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016|p=591}}–1580),{{sfn|Beazley|1908|p=82|ps=: Jane Hough was buried 3 November 1580 at [[Neston]].}} whose early life is a complete mystery. According to novelist [[Hilary Mantel]], &quot;Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter, and beyond the fact that she existed, we know very little about her. She comes briefly into the records, in an incredibly obscure way—she's in the archives of the county of Chester.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=George|title=Hilary Mantel interview revisited|url=http://podularity.com/2010/09/03/hilary-mantel-interview-revisited/|publisher=Podularity.com|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bindoff|1982}}{{sfn|Glover|1882|pp=127–128}}{{sfn|Edwards|1982}} 
Jane was born to an unknown mother while Cromwell mourned the loss of his wife and daughters. Jane presumably resided in Cromwell's homes, was educated, and spent time living with Gregory Cromwell at Leeds Castle in 1539. Cromwell's records show him paying for clothing and expenses for Jane.{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=14(2), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=75908 782]|ps=: Cromwell's accounts note a payment of £12 14s. 4d. for 'apparel for Mrs. Jane' on 23 May 1539.}} It is unknown what became of Jane's mother. Cromwell was known to be one of the few men at court without mistresses, and tried to keep this indiscretion secret.

Jane married William Hough (c. 1527–1585), of Leighton in Wirral, Cheshire, around 1550.{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016}} William Hough was the son of Richard Hough (1508–73/74) who was Cromwell's agent in Chester from 1534 to 1540.{{sfn|Glover|1882|pp=127–28}}{{sfn|Noble II|1787|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oaRCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}{{sfn|Ormerod|1819|p=304}}{{sfn|Edwards|1982}}  Jane and her husband remained staunch Roman Catholics, who, together with their daughter, Alice, her husband, William Whitmore, and their children, all came to the attention of the authorities as [[Recusancy|recusants]] during the reign of Elizabeth I.{{sfn|Wark|1971|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ8NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 153], [https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ8NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 168]}}

==Lawyer, Member of Parliament, adviser to Wolsey==
In 1517, and again in 1518, Cromwell led an embassy to Rome to obtain from [[Pope Leo X]] a [[papal bull]] for the reinstatement of [[Indulgences]] for the town of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].{{sfn|Elton|1991a|p=2}}
[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]]]]
By 1520, Cromwell was firmly established in London mercantile and legal circles.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} In 1523, he obtained a seat in the House of Commons as a [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]], though the constituency he represented has not been identified.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} After Parliament had been dissolved, Cromwell wrote a letter to a friend, jesting about the session's lack of productivity:&lt;blockquote&gt;I amongst other have indured a parlyament which contenwid by the space of xvii hole wekes wher we communyd of warre pease Stryffe contencyon debatte murmure grudge Riches poverte penurye trowth falshode Justyce equyte dicayte [deceit] opprescyon Magnanymyte actyvyte foce [force] attempraunce [moderation] Treason murder Felonye consyli...

Howbeyt in conclusyon we have d[one] as our predecessors have been wont to doo that ys to say, as well we myght and lefte wher we begann.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a short while in 1523 Cromwell became a trusted adviser to [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset]] before, early in 1524, becoming a member of the household of [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]], although initially he maintained his private legal practice; in that year he was elected a member of [[Gray's Inn]], a lawyers' guild.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=71; 79; 81}}  Cromwell assisted in the dissolution of nearly thirty monasteries to raise funds for Wolsey to found [[Ipswich School|The King's School, Ipswich]] (1528), and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Cardinal College]], in Oxford (1529).{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} In 1529 Wolsey appointed Cromwell a member of his council, as one of his most senior and trusted advisers.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=81}} By the end of October of that year, however, Wolsey had fallen from power.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Cromwell had made enemies by aiding Wolsey to suppress the monasteries, but was determined not to fall with his master, as he told [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], then a Gentleman Usher and later Wolsey's biographer:&lt;blockquote&gt;I do entend (god wyllyng) this after none, whan my lord hathe dyned to ride to london and so to the Court, where I wyll other make or marre, or ere [before] I come agayn, I wyll put my self in the prese [press] to se what any man is Able to lay to my charge of ontrouthe or mysdemeanor.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cavendish acknowledges that Cromwell's moves to mend the situation were by means of engaging  himself in an energetic defence of Wolsey (&quot;There could nothing be spoken against my lord…but he [Cromwell] would answer it incontinent[ly]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cavendish |first1=George |authorlink1=George Cavendish (writer) |editor1-last=Singer |editor1-first=Samuel Weller |editor1-link=Samuel Weller Singer |title=The Life of Cardinal Wolsey |date=1641 |publisher=Harding and Lepard |location=London |oclc=78945163 |edition=1825|volume=1|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;), rather than by distancing himself from his old master's actions, and this display of &quot;authentic loyalty&quot; only enhanced his reputation, not least in the mind of the King.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=98; 102}}

==Royal favourite==
Cromwell successfully overcame the shadow cast over his career by Wolsey's downfall. By November 1529, he had secured a seat in Parliament as a member for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]] and was reported to be in favour with the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Early in  this short  session of Parliament (November to December 1529) Cromwell involved himself with legislation to restrict absentee clergy from collecting stipends from multiple parishes (&quot;clerical farming&quot;) and to abolish the power of Rome to award dispensations for the practice.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=94}}&lt;ref&gt;21 Henry VIII cap 13 (&quot;Clergy Act&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=George Gresley |authorlink1=George Perry (priest) |title=A History of the Church of England: From the Accession of Henry VIII, to the Silencing of Convocation in the Eighteenth Century |date=1879 |publisher=Harper |location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during the closing weeks of 1530, the King appointed him to the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Cromwell held numerous offices during his career in the King's service, including:

===Anne Boleyn===
From 1527, Henry VIII had sought to have his marriage to Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]] annulled, so that he could lawfully marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

The third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as &quot;the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender&quot; of the Church. The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
 
The king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the [[Lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]] of [[Rumney, Cardiff|Romney]] in the [[Welsh Marches]] (recently confiscated from the family of the executed [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]]) and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=210–212}} None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]

Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=220}}

On 26 January 1533 Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor and his replacement as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)#Early history|Speaker of the House of Commons]] was Cromwell's old friend (and former lawyer to Cardinal Wolsey) [[Humphrey Wingfield]]. Cromwell further increased his control over parliament through his management of by-elections: since the previous summer, assisted by [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]], then [[Clerk of the Signet]],  he had prepared a list of suitably amenable &quot;burgesses, knights and citizens&quot; for the vacant parliamentary seats.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=214}} 

The parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome, reasserting the long-standing historical fiction that England was an &quot;empire&quot; and thus not subject to external jurisdiction.{{sfn|Scarisbrick|2008|p=314}} On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any adjudication concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King formal notice that the validity of his marriage to Catherine was to be the subject of an ecclesiastical court hearing. The trial began on 10 May 1533 at [[Dunstable Priory]] (near to where Catherine was staying at Ampthill Castle) and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced the court's verdict, declaring the marriage &quot;null and invalid…contrary to the law of God&quot;. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}{{sfn|Froude|1856|pp=426–8}}

In December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's verdict took statutory form as the [[First Succession Act|Act of Succession]], the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the [[Submission of the Clergy Act 1533|Act for the Submission of the Clergy]] incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

==King's chief minister==
In April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=247; 518}} Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later. On 7 May Cromwell led a deputation from the commissioners to Fisher and More, to persuade them to accept the Act and save themselves. This failed and, within a month, both prisoners were executed.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=333}}

On 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear their acceptance of the Oath of Succession. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

A &quot;lasting achievement&quot; of Cromwell's vicegerency was his direction of Autumn 1538 that every parish in the country should securely maintain a record of all christenings, marriages and burials. Although intended as a means to flush out [[Anabaptist]]s (dissenting religious refugees from the Low Countries and elsewhere who did not practise infant baptism) the measure proved to be of great benefit to the posterity of English historians.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=288}}

===Fall of Anne Boleyn===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]
The final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than £200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ives &quot;the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307–310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176–179}}

Anne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Sir Nicholas Carew]] and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Sir Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, [[Sir Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (courtier)|Sir William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|2013|pp=18–24}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192–205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The Queen and her brother stood trial on Monday 15 May, while the four others accused with them were condemned on the Friday beforehand. The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second [[Second Succession Act|Act of Succession]], securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===

Cromwell's position was now stronger than ever. He succeeded Anne Boleyn's father, [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], as [[Lord Privy Seal]] on 2 July 1536, resigning the office of [[Master of the Rolls]], which he had held since 8 October 1534. On 8 July 1536, he was raised to the peerage as [[Baron Cromwell]] of Wimbledon.{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=11, 202(3) and 202(14)}}

===Religious reform===
Cromwell orchestrated the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and visitations to the universities and colleges in 1535, which had strong links to the church. This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed &quot;popish&quot; and &quot;superstitious&quot;. This has been described as &quot;easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history&quot;. [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&amp;pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015|isbn=9781135031091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings, collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], found support among the gentry and even the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The pilgrimage of grace and the politics of the 1530s|last=Hoyle, R.

The rebels' grievances were wide-ranging, but the most significant was the suppression of the monasteries, blamed on the King's &quot;evil counsellors&quot;, principally Cromwell and Cranmer. One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning during his interrogation in the Tower: &quot;… men who have been in cases like with their prince as ye be now have come at the last to the same end that ye would now bring me unto.&quot;.{{sfn|Dodds|1915|p=186}} [[File:Thomas Cromwell medal, 1538 side 2.png|thumbnail|right|Portrait medal made for Thomas Cromwell in 1538.

The suppression of the risings spurred further Reformation measures. In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and academics. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]].{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=411–413}} By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

In January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the opponents of the old religion termed &quot;idolatry&quot;: statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on &quot;pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions&quot; and commanding that &quot;one book of the whole Bible in English&quot; be set up in every church. Moreover, following the &quot;voluntary&quot; surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also &quot;invited&quot; to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

====Resistance to further religious reform====
The King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538 (the &quot;[[Exeter Conspiracy]]&quot;), using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. Sir Geoffrey, &quot;broken in spirit&quot;, was pardoned but the others were executed.{{sfn|Bernard|2007|pp=412–426}}

On 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Then, Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, being the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

The King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

===Anne of Cleves===
[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]

Queen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: &quot;I like her not!&quot;. The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377–78, 386–88, 395, 405, 410–11}}

===Earl of Essex===

On 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}

=== Downfall and execution===
During 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king. The {{convert|65|×|48|cm|in|abbr=on}} painting is now displayed at the [[Louvre]] in Paris. When Henry finally met her, the king was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance.{{sfn|Elton|1991b|p=157}} Cromwell had passed on to Henry some exaggerated claims of Anne's beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&amp;pg=PA77 |title=The Marrying of Anne of Cleves: Royal Protocol in Early Modern England|first=Retha M.|last=Warnicke|page=77|date=13 April 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521770378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oku_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73 |title=Henry VIII and his Court|first=Luise|last=Muhlbach|date=14 May 2010|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781849891172}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, Cromwell was one of only two courtiers with whom the king confided that he had been unable to [[consummate]] the union (the other was [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Lord High Admiral Southampton]], who had conducted Anne from Calais). When Henry's humiliation became common knowledge, Southampton (or possibly [[Edmund Bonner|Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London]]) made sure that Cromwell was blamed for the indiscretion. Both men were erstwhile friends of Cromwell and their self-serving disloyalty indicated that the minister's position was already known to be weakening.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke (2000) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=524–5}}

A long-mooted Franco-Imperial alliance (contrary to England's interests) had failed to materialise: Cromwell had caused the Duke of Norfolk to be sent to the court of the French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to offer Henry's support in his unresolved dispute with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor]], and the mission had been received favourably. This changed the balance of power in England's favour and demonstrated that Cromwell's earlier foreign policy of wooing support from the [[Duchy of Cleves]] had unnecessarily caused his king's conjugal difficulty.{{sfn|Head|1995|pp=152–166}}

Early in 1540 Cromwell's religiously conservative, aristocratic enemies, headed by the Duke of Norfolk and assisted by [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Gardiner]] (colloquially known as &quot;Wily Winchester&quot;), decided that the country's decline towards &quot;doctrinal radicalism&quot; in religion, as expressed in a series of parliamentary debates held throughout that Spring, had gone too far. They saw in [[Catherine Howard]], Norfolk's niece, &quot;considerately put in the king's way by that pander, her uncle of Norfolk&quot;, an opportunity to displace their foe.{{sfn|Elton|1951|p=175}} Catherine's assignations with the king were openly facilitated by the duke and the bishop and as she &quot;[strode] towards the throne&quot; the two conspirators found themselves edging once more into political power.{{sfn|Loades|2012|loc=Chapter 4 &quot;The Summer of 1540&quot;; Chapter 5 &quot;The Rival Queens&quot;}}{{sfn|Scarisbrick|2008|pp=376, 429}} It would have been a simple matter for Cromwell to arrange an annulment of Henry's marriage to the tractable Anne, but this would have put him in greater jeopardy as it would clear the way for Catherine to marry the king.{{sfn|Elton|1951|p=175}} At this point, however, cynical self-interest may have made Henry hesitate to act immediately against Cromwell, as the minister was guiding two important revenue bills (the Subsidy Bill and a bill to confiscate the assets of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John]]) through parliament.{{sfn|Elton|1951|p=174}}

Cromwell was arrested at a Council meeting on 10 June 1540 and accused of various charges. He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. His enemies took every opportunity to humiliate him: they even tore off his [[Order of the Garter]], remarking that &quot;A traitor must not wear it.&quot; His initial reaction was defiance: &quot;This then is my reward for faithful service!&quot; he cried out, and angrily defied his fellow Councillors to call him a traitor. A [[Bill of Attainder]] containing a long list of indictments, including supporting [[Anabaptists]], corrupt practices, leniency in matters of justice, acting for personal gain, protecting Protestants accused of heresy and thus failing to enforce the [[Act of Six Articles]], and plotting to marry [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], was introduced into the [[House of Lords]] a week later and passed on 29 June 1540.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yoevCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 |title=Thomas Cromwell: Tudor Minister|first=B.

Hoping for clemency, Cromwell wrote in support of the annulment, in his last personal address to the King.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=419–20}} He ended the letter: &quot;Most gracious Prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy.&quot;{{sfn|Elton|1991a|p=2}}

Cromwell was condemned to death without trial, lost all his titles and property and was publicly beheaded on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 July 1540, on the same day as the King's marriage to [[Catherine Howard]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2008}} Cromwell made a prayer and speech on the scaffold, professing to die, &quot;in the traditional faith&quot; [Catholic] and denying that he had aided heretics.

Hall said of Cromwell's downfall,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many lamented but more rejoiced, and specially such as either had been religious men, or favoured religious persons; for they banqueted and triumphed together that night, many wishing that that day had been seven years before; and some fearing lest he should escape, although he were imprisoned, could not be merry. Others who knew nothing but truth by him both lamented him and heartily prayed for him. But this is true that of certain of the clergy he was detestably hated, &amp; specially of such as had borne swynge [beaten hard], and by his means was put from it; for in deed he was a man that in all his doings seemed not to favour any kind of Popery, nor could not abide the snoffyng pride of some prelates, which undoubtedly, whatsoever else was the cause of his death, did shorten his life and procured the end that he was brought unto.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=838–839}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Henry came to regret Cromwell's killing and later accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell's downfall by &quot;pretexts&quot; and &quot;false accusations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; On 3 March 1541, the French Ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], reported in a letter that the King was now said to be lamenting that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;under pretext of some slight offences which he had committed, they had brought several accusations against him, on the strength of which he had put to death the most faithful servant he ever had.{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=16, 590}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There remains an element of what [[G. R. Elton]] describes as &quot;mystery&quot; about Cromwell's demise. In April 1540, just three months before he went to the block, he was created Earl of Essex and Lord Great Chamberlain. The arbitrary and unpredictable streak in the King's personality, which more than once exercised influence during his reign, had surfaced again and washed Cromwell away in its wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d4qgsSLZQgC&amp;pg=PA269 |title=Hume and Machiavelli: Political Realism and Liberal Thought|first=Frederick G.|last=Whelan|date=14 January 2018|page=269|publisher=Lexington Books|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780739106310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Cromwell's years in power, he skilfully managed Crown finances and extended royal authority. In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

==Personal religious beliefs==
Although Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.&lt;ref&gt;William Underwood, &quot;Thomas Cromwell and William Marshall's Protestant books&quot;. ''The Historical Journal'' 47.3 (2004): 517–539. [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/thomas-cromwell-and-william-marshalls-protestant-books/3B05EA4539D100486353138B7AFB42CE online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1535 Cromwell succeeded in having clearly identified reformers, such as [[Hugh Latimer]], [[Edward Foxe]] and [[Nicholas Shaxton]], appointed to the [[episcopacy]]. He encouraged and supported the work of reformers, such as [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]]; and he obtained the licence to publish the [[Matthew's Bible]], providing significant funding for the printing of this English translation of the Bible and sending one to every parish in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AXp3GFGYXwC&amp;q=thomas+cromwell+++matthew+bible+great+bible|title=Matthew's Bible: A Facsimile of the 1537 Edition|first1=John|last1=Rogers|first2=Joseph W.|last2=Johnson|date=14 January 2018|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781598563498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05UXAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=thomas+cromwell+the+great+bible&amp;pg=PT24|title=The New King James Version: In the Great Tradition|first=Arthur L.|last=Farstad|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Thomas Nelson|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780718021788}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1538, it was compulsory for all churches to own a Bible, in accordance with Cromwell's injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Cranmer-archbishop-of-Canterbury|title=Thomas Cranmer - archbishop of Canterbury|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_reformation_events.shtml|title=BBC – Radio 4 Voices of the Powerless – 08/08/2002 featuring the Reformation's dates|first=British Broadcasting|last=Corporation|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised version, the [[Great Bible]], was widely available by 1539 and included a picture of Henry VIII, [[Thomas Cranmer]] and Cromwell on the title page.{{sfn|Hutchinson|2008|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlyenglishbibles.com/earlyversions/GreatFull5b.html|title=Great Bible (Full Story) – Early English Bibles|website=Earlyenglishbibles.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, his alleged support for [[Anabaptism]] was cited. Although the charge was spurious, the fact that it was levelled at all demonstrates the reputation for evangelical sympathies Cromwell had developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an-eXXA3DBMC&amp;q=charge+of+anabaptism+thomas+cromwell&amp;pg=PA15|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639–1660|first=Stephen C.|last=Manganiello|page=15|date=14 January 2018|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780810851009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==

Until the 1950s, historians discounted Cromwell's role, calling him a doctrinaire hack who was little more than the agent of the despotic King Henry VIII. The 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states &quot;his power has been overrated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Cromwell,_Thomas,_Earl_of_Essex | title=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Cromwell, Thomas, Earl of Essex – Wikisource, the free online library}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Elton]], however, in ''The Tudor Revolution'' (1953), featured him as the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government, the presiding genius, much more so than the king, in handling the break with Rome and in creating the laws and administrative procedures that reshaped post-Reformation England. Elton wrote that Cromwell had been responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms, creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of Church lands, and largely removing the medieval features of central government.{{sfn|Elton|1953|p=414}}

Subsequent historians have agreed with Elton as to Cromwell's importance, though not with his claims of &quot;revolution&quot;.{{sfn|Bernard|1998|pp=587–607 Bernard argues Elton exaggerated Cromwell's role}}{{sfn|Coby|2009|p=197}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1983|p=210}} Leithead (2004) wrote, &quot;Against significant opposition he secured acceptance of the king's new powers, created a more united and more easily governable kingdom, and provided the crown, at least temporarily, with a very significant landed endowment.&quot;{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Diarmaid MacCulloch credits the advancement of the most significant politicians and administrators of the reign of [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], including [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Nicholas Bacon]], to the influence and guidance of Thomas Cromwell at the start of their careers.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=550–1}}

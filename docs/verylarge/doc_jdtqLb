The 2nd century AD biographer and essayist [[Plutarch]] makes a connection between the ''sparagmos'' and the punishment of the Titans, but makes no mention of the anthropogony, or Orpheus, or Orphism. In his essay ''On the Eating of Flesh'', Plutarch writes of &quot;stories told about the sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus and the outrageous assaults of the Titans upon him, and their punishment and blasting by thunderbolt after they had tasted his blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''On the Eating of Flesh'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/plutarch-eating_flesh/1957/pb_LCL406.559.xml?result=108&amp;rskey=XXmYuB 1.996 C]; Linforth, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=360 pp. 334 ff.] Edmonds 1999, [http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/redmonds/zagreus.pdf pp. 44–47].&lt;/ref&gt; While, according to the early 4th century AD [[Christian apologist]] [[Arnobius]], and the 5th century AD Greek epic poet [[Nonnus]], it is as punishment for their murder of Dionysus that the Titans end up imprisoned by Zeus in Tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' [https://archive.org/stream/thesevenbooksofa00arnouoft#page/n269/mode/2up 5.19 (p. 242)] (= Orphic [https://archive.org/stream/orphicorumfragme00orphuoft#page/110/mode/2up fr. 34 Kern]); [[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/228/mode/2up 6.206&amp;ndash;210].&lt;/ref&gt;

The only ancient source to explicitly connect the ''sparagmos'' and the anthropogony is the 6th century AD [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]], who writes that, according to Orpheus, after the Titans had dismembered and eaten Dionysus, &quot;Zeus, angered by the deed, blasts them with his thunderbolts, and from the sublimate of the vapors that rise from them comes the matter from which men are created.&quot; Olympiodorus goes on to conclude that, because the Titans had eaten his flesh, we their descendants, are a part of Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds 1999, [http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/redmonds/zagreus.pdf p. 40]; Olympiodorus, ''In Plato Phaedon'' 1.3 (= Orphic [https://archive.org/stream/orphicorumfragme00orphuoft#page/238/mode/2up fr. 220 Kern]); Spineto [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpIJ64a5alUC&amp;pg=PA34 p. 34]; Burkert 1985, p. 463 n. 15; West 1983, pp. 164–165; Linforth, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008294699;view=1up;seq=352 pp. 326 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interpretations===
Some 19th- and 20th-century scholars, including [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], have argued that an initiatory or [[Shamanism|shamanic]] ritual underlies the myth of the dismemberment and cannibalism of [[Dionysus]] by the Titans.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] also asserts this in relation to shamanistic initiatory rites of early Greek religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;West 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''Τiτᾶνες'' (''Titanes'') is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, p. 97; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA35 p. 35]; West 1966, p. 200; Rose, p. 1079 s.v. Titan.&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod in the ''Theogony'' gives a double etymology, deriving it from ''titaino'' [to strain] and ''tisis'' [vengeance], saying that Uranus gave them the name Titans: &quot;in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 207-210; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:207-239 207&amp;ndash;210]. For a discussion see West 1966, p. 225&amp;ndash;226 on line 209 '''τιταίνοντας'''.&lt;/ref&gt; But modern scholars doubt Hesiod's etymology.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 1079 s.v. Titan, calls Hesiod's derivation &quot;fanciful&quot;, while Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA35 p. 35], describes it as &quot;obviously factitious&quot;, adding that &quot;there is some ancient evidence to suggest that it may have meant 'princes' or the like&quot;; while West p. 225 on line 209 '''τιταίνοντας''', says that &quot;it is not clear how or why the Titans 'strained'&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Ellen Harrison]] asserts that the word &quot;Titan&quot; comes from the Greek τίτανος, signifying white &quot;earth, clay, or gypsum,&quot; and that the Titans were &quot;white clay men&quot;, or men covered by white clay or gypsum dust in their rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 491 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In astronomy==
The planet [[Saturn]] is named for the Roman equivalent of the Titan Cronus. Saturn's largest moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], is named after the Titans generally, and the other [[moons of Saturn]] are named after individual Titans, specifically [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]], and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]. Astronomer [[William Henry Pickering]] claimed to have discovered another moon of Saturn which he named [[Themis (hypothetical moon)|Themis]], but this discovery was never confirmed, and the name Themis was given to an asteroid, [[24 Themis]]. Asteroid [[57 Mnemosyne]] was also named for the Titan.

A proto-planet [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] is hypothesized to have been involved in a collision in the early solar system, forming the Earth's moon.

Titan is one of six [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|gravitationally rounded]] moons from [[Saturn]], and the most distant from Saturn of those six. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's [[moon]] and 80% more massive. It is the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|second-largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]] after Jupiter's moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and is larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]], Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four [[Galilean moons|Galilean moons of Jupiter]]). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and, were it visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.

Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]] and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titan from Cassini-Huygens |url=https://archive.org/details/titanfromcassini00brow |url-access=limited |editor=Robert Brown |editor2=Jean Pierre Lebreton |editor3=Hunter Waite|publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/titanfromcassini00brow/page/n73 69]|isbn=9781402092152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as with [[Venus]] before the [[Space Age]], the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of [[liquid hydrocarbon]] lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few [[impact crater]]s, although mountains and several possible [[cryovolcano]]es have been found.

The atmosphere of Titan is largely [[nitrogen]]; minor components lead to the formation of [[methane]] and [[ethane]] clouds and heavy [[:Category:Organonitrogen compounds|organonitrogen haze]]. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth's [[water cycle]], albeit at the much lower temperature of about {{convert|94|K|°C F}}.

==History==
===Discovery===
[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Christiaan Huygens]] discovered Titan in 1655.]]

Christiaan, with the help of his elder brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]], began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 4, 2008 |title=Discoverer of Titan: Christiaan Huygens |url=http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMJRT57ESD_index_0.html |publisher=European Space Agency |access-date=April 18, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809144038/http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMJRT57ESD_index_0.html |archive-date=August 9, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the sixth moon ever discovered, after Earth's [[Moon]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Huygens Discovers Luna Saturni |access-date=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
Huygens named his discovery ''Saturni Luna'' (or ''Luna Saturni'', Latin for &quot;Saturn's moon&quot;), publishing in the 1655 tract ''De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova'' (''A New Observation of Saturn's Moon'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huygens |first1=Christiaan |last2=Société hollandaise des sciences |title=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens |date=1888 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=The Hague, Netherlands |volume=vol. 1 |pages=387–388 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/61160#page/415/mode/1up |language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position). Other early epithets for Titan include &quot;Saturn's ordinary satellite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassini |first=G. D. |title=A Discovery of two New Planets about Saturn, made in the Royal Parisian Observatory by Signor Cassini, Fellow of both the Royal Societys, of England and France; English't out of French |journal=Philosophical Transactions |volume=8 |issue=1673 |pages=5178–5185 |date=1673 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1673.0003 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Titan is officially numbered '''Saturn VI''' because after the 1789 discoveries the numbering scheme was frozen to avoid causing any more confusion (Titan having borne the numbers II and IV as well as VI). Numerous small moons have been discovered closer to Saturn since then.

The name ''Titan'', and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known, came from [[John Herschel]] (son of [[William Herschel]], discoverer of two other Saturnian moons, [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]), in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations Made during the Years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lassell |date=November 12, 1847 |title=Observations of Mimas, the closest and most interior satellite of Saturn |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0008//0000042.000.html |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=42–43 |access-date=March 29, 2005 | doi = 10.1093/mnras/8.3.42|bibcode = 1848MNRAS...8...42L |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/Resultsastronom00Hers#page/414/mode/2up/search/Titan|title=Results of astronomical observations made during the years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope : being the completion of a telescopic survey of the whole surface of the visible heavens, commenced in 1825|last=Herschel|first=Sir John F. W.|publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; Co.|year=1847|location=London|pages=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the names of the mythological [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:Τιτάν#Ancient Greek|Τῑτᾶνες]]}}), brothers and sisters of [[Cronus]], the Greek Saturn. In Greek mythology, the Titans were a race of powerful [[deities]], descendants of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], that ruled during the legendary [[Golden Age]].

==Orbit and rotation==
[[File:Titan's orbit.svg|thumb|Titan's orbit (highlighted in red) among the other large inner moons of Saturn. The moons outside its orbit are (from the outside to the inside) Iapetus and Hyperion; those inside are Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, and Mimas.]]
Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days 22 hours. Like Earth's [[Moon]] and many of the satellites of the [[giant planet]]s, its [[rotational period]] (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evs-islands.com/2008/02/titans-unnamed-methane-sea.html |title=EVS-Islands: Titan's Unnamed Methane Sea |access-date=October 22, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809201152/http://www.evs-islands.com/2008/02/titans-unnamed-methane-sea.html |archive-date=August 9, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;horizons&quot;&gt;Unless otherwise specified: {{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top |title=JPL HORIZONS solar system data and ephemeris computation service |work=Solar System Dynamics |publisher=NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=August 19, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007034731/http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top |archive-date=October 7, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- As http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem shows, that's 0.28° to the local Laplace plane, itself inclined 0.6° to Saturn's equator; an example of the calculation required to get the number shown here is given at [[Talk:Phoebe (moon)]] --&gt; Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over {{convert|1200000|km|mi|sp=us}}) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 [[arcsecond]]s in diameter.

The small, irregularly shaped satellite [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] is locked in a 3:4 [[orbital resonance]] with Titan. A &quot;slow and smooth&quot; evolution of the resonance—in which Hyperion migrated from a chaotic orbit—is considered unlikely, based on models. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected bodies that made close approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bevilacqua |first=R. |last2=Menchi |first2=O. |last3=Milani |first3=A. |last4=Nobili |first4=A.

==Formation==
The moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through [[Accretion disc|co-accretion]], a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's [[Galilean satellites]], but that they were disrupted by a series of [[giant impact]]s, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giant impact scenario may explain the unusual moons of Saturn |work=Space Daily |date=2012 |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Giant_impact_scenario_may_explain_the_unusual_moons_of_Saturn_999.html |access-date=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 analysis of Titan's atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it has possibly been sourced from material similar to that found in the [[Oort cloud]] and not from sources present during co-accretion of materials around Saturn.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-201450623&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |last=Dyches |first=Preston |last2=Clavin |first2=Whitney |title=Titan's Building Blocks Might Pre-date Saturn |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-200 |date=June 23, 2014 |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |access-date=June 28, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627165816/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-200 |archive-date=June 27, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clouds typically cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened [[insolation|levels of sunlight]] during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in [[convection]]. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Emily L. |first=Schaller |last2=Brouwn |first2=Michael E. |last3=Roe |first3=Henry G. |last4=Bouchez |first4=Antonin H. |date=2006 |title=A large cloud outburst at Titan's south pole |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.12.021 |journal=Icarus |issue=1 |pages=224–229 |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/largecloud.pdf |volume=182 |bibcode=2006Icar..182..224S |access-date=August 23, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926102541/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/largecloud.pdf |archive-date=September 26, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titan wind&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Way the Wind Blows on Titan |date=June 1, 2007 |url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20070601f/ |access-date=June 2, 2007 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427110242/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/cassinifeatures/feature20070601f/ |archive-date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Huge ethane cloud discovered on Titan |last=Shiga |first=David |journal=New Scientist |volume=313 |page=1620 |date=2006 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10073-huge-ethane-cloud-discovered-on-titan.html |access-date=August 7, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220030748/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10073-huge-ethane-cloud-discovered-on-titan.html |archive-date=December 20, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of hydrocarbon seas on Titan was first suggested based on ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' data that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them, but direct evidence was not obtained until 1995 when data from Hubble and other observations suggested the existence of [[liquid methane]] on Titan, either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite-wide oceans, similar to water on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dermott |first=S.

[[File:Specular Spectacular (PIA18432).jpg|thumb|right|Near-infrared radiation from the Sun reflecting off Titan's hydrocarbon seas]]
On July 8, 2009, ''Cassini's'' VIMS observed a specular reflection indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, off what today is called [[Jingpo Lacus]], a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness. Specular reflections are indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;press&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook |first=J.-R.

Early radar measurements made in July 2009 and January 2010 indicated that Ontario Lacus was extremely shallow, with an average depth of 0.4–3&amp;nbsp;m, and a maximum depth of {{convert|3|to|7|m|sp=us|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=sdc20101217/&gt; In contrast, the northern hemisphere's [[Ligeia Mare]] was initially mapped to depths exceeding 8&amp;nbsp;m, the maximum discernable by the radar instrument and the analysis techniques of the time.&lt;ref name=sdc20101217&gt;

Later science analysis, released in 2014, more fully mapped the depths of Titan's three methane seas and showed depths of more than {{convert|200|m|sp=us}}. [[Ligeia Mare]] averages from {{convert|20|to|40|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} in depth, while other parts of ''Ligeia'' did not register any radar reflection at all, indicating a depth of more than {{convert|200|m|sp=us|abbr=on}}.

In May 2013, ''Cassini'''s radar altimeter observed Titan's Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea but there are a few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio Poggiali, Marco Mastrogiuseppe, Alexander G.

During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, ''Cassini'' gathered radiometric tracking and optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively deformable, and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tides&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Perkins |title=Tides turn on Titan |date=June 28, 2012 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/tides-turn-on-titan-1.10917 |work=Nature |access-date=June 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007082709/http://www.nature.com/news/tides-turn-on-titan-1.10917 |archive-date=October 7, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's findings, together with the results of previous studies, hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} below its surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tides&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Titan ocean of water&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Puiu |first=Tibi |title=Saturn's moon Titan most likely harbors a subsurface ocean of water |work=zmescience.com web site |date=June 29, 2012 |url=http://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/titan-subsurface-ocean-of-water-23323/ |access-date=June 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903075517/http://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/titan-subsurface-ocean-of-water-23323/ |archive-date=September 3, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20140702&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Dyches |first=Preston |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=Ocean on Saturn Moon Could be as Salty as the Dead Sea |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-217 |date=July 2, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |access-date=July 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709165628/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-217 |archive-date=July 9, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICARUS-2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitri |first=Giuseppe |last2=Meriggiola |first2=Rachele |last3=Hayes |first3=Alex |last4=Lefevree |first4=Axel |last5=Tobie | first5=Gabriel |last6=Genovad |first6=Antonio |last7=Lunine |first7=Jonathan I. |last8=Zebker |first8=Howard |title=Shape, topography, gravity anomalies and tidal deformation of Titan |date= 2014 |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.03.018 |volume=236 |pages=169–177 |bibcode = 2014Icar..236..169M }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting [[methane]] rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an &quot;alkanofer&quot;, to produce [[ethane]] and [[propane]] that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20140903&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Dyches |first=Preston |last2=Mousis |first2=Olivier |last3=Altobelli |first3=Nicolas |title=Icy Aquifers on Titan Transform Methane Rainfall |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-294 |date=September 3, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |access-date=September 4, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905000214/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-294 |archive-date=September 5, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

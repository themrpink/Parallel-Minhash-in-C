Many{{how many|date=August 2020}} legitimate (or at least fully registered) companies work on a similar basis, using this method as their primary source of earnings. Some modelling and escort agencies tell applicants that they have a number of clients lined up, but that they require some sort of prior &quot;registration fee&quot;, usually paid in by an untraceable method, e.g. by Western Union transfer; once the fee is paid, the applicant is informed the client has cancelled, and not contacted again.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The scammer contacts the victim to interest them in a &quot;work-at-home&quot; opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim to work as a &quot;mystery shopper&quot;, evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|title=Denton Woman Says Mystery Shopper Job Was Scam|publisher=Nbc5i.com|date=November 6, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927013037/http://www.nbc5i.com/newsbycounty/14519865/detail.html|archivedate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order [[#Fake checks|as described above]], the victim deposits it—banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false— and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer only a small part of the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====Bogus job offers====
More sophisticated scams advertise jobs with real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters pretending to be recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tony|title=Columbus woman warns others to beware of job phishing scams.|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/business/article136738313.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Ledger-Enquirer|date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newer form of employment scam has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html|title=Taking the Bait On a Phish Scam, Job Seekers Are Targets, Victims of Sophisticated Ploy|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=2007-10-02|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/business/fi-monster11|title=Sleeping on the job? Security at work-applicant sites faulted|last=Menn|first=Joseph|date=2007-11-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of employment scam involves making people receive a fake &quot;interview&quot; where they are told the benefits of the company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalog merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of the physical catalog to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When &quot;given&quot; the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of &quot;training&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Diane|title=Upstate company posts salaried job ads, but isn't hiring for real positions say fmr. employees.|url=http://wspa.com/2017/02/23/upstate-company-posts-salaried-job-ads-but-isnt-hiring-real-for-positions-say-fmr-employees/|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[WSPA-TV]]|date=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kliot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kliot|first1=Hannah|title=Online employment scams target college students.|url=http://www.ksat.com/education/college-students-targeted-by-online-employment-scams|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=[[KSAT-TV]]|date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cash-handling scam====
These scammers do internet searches on various companies to obtain hiring managers' names. They then advertise job offers on [[job search engines]]. The job hunter will then apply for the position with a resume. The person applying for the position will get a message almost instantly from a common (usually free) email account, asking for credentials. The scammer will sometimes request that the victim has an Instant Messenger chat to obtain more information. The scammer guarantees employment, usually through automated computer programs that have a certain algorithm, with &quot;canned responses&quot; in broken English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

At this point, it is usually too late and the process has already begun. If the victim questions the integrity of the process, the computer program may call ''them'' a &quot;scammer&quot; and can be quite vulgar. Quite often, the fraudulent negotiables are still sent to the address on the victim's resume, even after the fake online rant.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The scammer sends the victim fraudulent negotiables, assuring them that they get to keep part of the funds. They will expect the victim to send the remainder to various parties that they specify, under the guise that they are legitimate business contacts. This is a [[money laundering]] scheme, as the victim becomes a pawn in the filtering process. The process continues until the victim catches on, or even gets caught.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Another form of the scam is the representative/collection agent variation, wherein the scammer advertises, usually on legitimate online job sites, available positions for representative or collection agent for a company abroad.  As the representative, the job involves receiving cash payments and depositing payments received from &quot;customers&quot; into one's account and remitting the rest to the overseas business bank account.  This is essentially money laundering.

===Lottery scam===
{{Main|Lottery scam}}
The lottery scam involves fake notices of lottery wins, although the intended victim has not entered the lottery. The &quot;winner&quot; is usually asked to send sensitive information such as name, residential address, occupation/position, lottery number etc. to a free email account which is at times untraceable or without any link -- stuff you should NEVER share with strangers on the internet. In addition to harvesting this information, the scammer then notifies the victim that releasing the funds requires some small fee (insurance, registration, or shipping). Once the victim sends the fee, the scammer invents another fee.

The [[#Fake checks|fake check]] technique described above is also used. Fake or stolen checks, representing a part payment of the winnings, being sent; then a fee, smaller than the amount received, is requested. The bank receiving the bad check eventually reclaims the funds from the victim.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In 2004, a variant of the lottery scam appeared in the United States: a scammer phones a victim purporting to be speaking on behalf of the government about a grant they qualify for, subject to an advance fee of typically US$250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/govgrant.asp |title=Government Grant Scam |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical lottery scams address the person as some variation of ''Lucky Winner''. This is a red flag as if you entered an actual lottery and won, they would know your name, and not just call you ''Lucky Winner''.

===Online sales and rentals===
Many scams involve the purchase of goods and services via classified advertisements, especially on sites like [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], or [[Gumtree]]. These typically involve the scammer contacting the seller of a particular good or service via telephone or email expressing interest in the item. They will typically then send a fake [[cheque|check]] written for an amount greater than the asking price, asking the seller to send the difference to an alternate address, usually by [[money order]] or [[Western Union]]. A seller eager to sell a particular product may not wait for the check to clear, and when the bad check bounces, the funds wired have already been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraudguides&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Craigslist Scams.|url=http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|publisher=fraudguides.com|accessdate=June 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705075209/http://www.fraudguides.com/internet-craigslist-scams.asp|archivedate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scammers advertise phony academic conferences in exotic or international locations, complete with fake websites, scheduled agendas and advertising experts in a particular field that will be presenting there. They offer to pay the airfare of the participants, but not the hotel accommodations. They will extract money from the victims when they attempt to reserve their accommodations in a non-existent hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant_Bob&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Bob|title=Another fake conference?|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, an inexpensive rental property is advertised by a fake landlord, who is typically out of state (or the country) and asking for the rent and/or deposit to be wired to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sichelman_Lew&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sichelman|first=Lew|title=Rental scams can target either landlords or tenants|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/25/business/la-fi-lew-20120325|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or the [[con artist]] finds a property, pretends to be the owner, lists it online, and communicates with the would-be renter to make a cash deposit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aho_Karen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Aho|first=Karen|title=Renters: Beware of new twists on an old scam|url=http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=[[MSN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090312/http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=20482759|archive-date=May 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer may also be the renter as well, in which case they pretend to be a foreign student and contact a landlord seeking accommodation. They usually state they are not yet in the country and wish to secure accommodations prior to arriving. Once the terms are negotiated, a forged check is forwarded for a greater amount than negotiated, and the fraudster asks the landlord to wire some of the money back.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKee_Chris&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=McKee |first=Chris |title=Room rental internet scam takes Eugene college students for thousands |url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[KMTR]] |date=March 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120215930/http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story/Room-rental-internet-scam-takes-Eugene-college/WwwCZHV1r0-7RtEY9kXpLw.cspx |archivedate=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pet scams===
This is a variation of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are advertised as bait on online advertising websites using little real seller verification like [[Craigslist]], [[Gumtree]], and [[Junk Mail Digital Media|JunkMail]]. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or wherever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Kennel Club&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Kennel Club&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Kennel Club&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AKC and Better Business Bureau Warn Consumers to Be Wary of Puppy Scams|url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=3220|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous problems are encountered in the courier phase of the scam. The crate is too small and the victim has the option of either purchasing a crate with air conditioning or renting one while also paying a deposit, typically called a caution or cautionary fee. The victim may also have to pay for insurance if such fees have not been paid yet. If the victim pays these fees, the pet may become sick and a veterinarian's assistance is sought for which the victim has to repay the courier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herb_Weisbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the victim may be asked to pay for a health certificate needed to transport the pet, and for kennel fees during the recuperation period. The further the scam progresses, the more similar are the fictitious fees to those of typical 419 scams. It is not uncommon to see customs or like fees being claimed if such charges fit into the scam plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herb_Weisbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisbaum|first=Herb|title=Hound hoax: Con artists target dog lovers|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/19299243|accessdate=June 18, 2007|newspaper=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scam websites may be used for this scam. This scam has been linked to the classical 419 scams in that the fictitious couriers used, as are also used in other types of 419 scams such as lotto scams.

===Romance scam===
{{Main|Romance scam}}

One of the variants is the ''Romance Scam'', a money-for-romance angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;KMBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719002945/http://www.kmbc.com/money/9246998/detail.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-19|title=Online Romance Scams Continue To Grow - Project Economy News Story|publisher=Kmbc.com|date=2006-05-19|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The con artist approaches the victim on an [[online dating service]], an [[instant messenger]], or a social networking site. The scammer claims an interest in the victim, and posts pictures of an attractive person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seduce2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/8704213|title=Singles seduced into scams online|publisher=NBC News|date=2005-07-28|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer uses this communication to gain confidence, then asks for money.&lt;ref name=&quot;KMBC&quot;/&gt; 

The con artist may claim to be interested in meeting the victim but needs cash to book a plane, buy a bus ticket, rent a hotel room, pay for personal-travel costs such as gasoline or a vehicle rental, or to cover other expenses. In other cases, they claim they're trapped in a foreign country and need assistance to return, to escape imprisonment by corrupt local officials, to pay for medical expenses due to an illness contracted abroad, and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seduce2&quot;/&gt; The scammer may also use the confidence gained by the romance angle to introduce some variant of the original Nigerian Letter scheme,&lt;ref name=&quot;Seduce2&quot;/&gt; such as saying they need to get money or valuables out of the country and offer to share the wealth, making the request for help in leaving the country even more attractive to the victim. 

Scams often involve meeting someone on an online match-making service.&lt;ref name=&quot;KMBC&quot;/&gt; The scammer initiates contact with their target who is out of the area and requests money for transportation fare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seduce2&quot;/&gt; Scammers will typically ask for money to be sent via a [[money order]] or [[wire transfer]] due to the need to travel, or for medical or business costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;romance_scam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Attorney general: Beware of romance scams on Valentine's Day.|url=http://www.sent-trib.com/news/attorney-general-beware-of-romance-scams-on-valentine-s-day/article_45ec84ba-f060-11e6-9e53-738933627fec.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|publisher=Sentinel-Tribune|date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a victim travels to a meeting, it can have deadly consequence as in the case of Jette Jacobs, 67, from Australia. Jette Jacobs traveled to South Africa to supposedly marry her scammer, Jesse Orowo Omokoh, 28, after having sent more than $200,000 to him over a three-year period. Her body was discovered on February 9, 2013, under mysterious circumstances, two days after meeting up with Omokoh. Omokoh has fled back to Nigeria. After questioning in Nigeria, Omokoh was arrested. He was found to have had 32 fake online identities. He was never charged with murder, due to the inability to prove he had a hand in the death of Jette Jacobs, only fraud charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/jette-jacobs-son-visits-the-scene-of-his-mothers-alleged-murder-by-a-love-scammer-in-south-africa/story-fnhocxo3-1226930446657|title=Jette Jacobs' son visits the scene of his mother's alleged murder by a love scammer in South Africa|access-date=2016-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621163613/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/jette-jacobs-son-visits-the-scene-of-his-mothers-alleged-murder-by-a-love-scammer-in-south-africa/story-fnhocxo3-1226930446657|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efccnigeria.org/efcc/index.php/news/910-efcc-arraigns-suspected-conman-for-90-000-romance-scam|title=EFCC Arraigns Suspected Conman for $90,000 Romance Scam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile tower installation fraud===
{{Main|Mobile tower fraud}}
This variant of advance-fee fraud is widespread in India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://propakistani.pk/2010/10/09/fraud-of-the-year-minting-money-by-acquiring-land-for-towers/|title=Fraud of the Year: Minting Money by Acquiring Land for Towers|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Villagers-fall-prey-to-mobile-tower-scam/articleshow/47697564.cms|title=Villagers fall prey to mobile tower scam - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraudster uses Internet classified websites and print media to lure the public for the installation of a mobile phone tower on their property, with the promise of huge rental returns. The fraudster also creates fake websites to appear legitimate. The victims part with their money in pieces to the fraudster on account of the Government Service Tax, government clearance charges, bank charges, transportation charges, survey fee etc. The Indian government is issuing public notices in media to spread awareness among the public and warn them against mobile tower fraudsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Measures to Protect Consumer Interest - Consumer Info: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|url = http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|website = www.trai.gov.in|access-date = 2016-02-20|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212020852/http://www.trai.gov.in/Content/mpci.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Mass Marketing Frauds in the garb of Mobile Towers in India: Evolving a Framework to handle it|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294219016|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-02-20|doi = 10.13140/RG.2.1.4630.2480|last = Kumar|first = Harish|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other scams===
Other scams involve unclaimed property, also called &quot;[[bona vacantia]]&quot; in the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[England and Wales]] (other than the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]), this property is administered by the Bona Vacantia Division of the Treasury Solicitor's Department{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Fraudulent emails and letters claiming to be from this department have been reported, informing the recipient they are the beneficiary of a legacy but requiring the payment of a fee before sending more information or releasing the money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bona_Vacantia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Scam Email Warnings. |url=http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |publisher=Bona Vacantia |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712102227/http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/scam-email-warning.aspx |archivedate=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], messages are falsely claimed to be from the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a real organization, but one that does not and cannot itself make payments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leamy_Elisabeth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Leamy|first=Elisabeth|title=Beware of Unclaimed Money Scams|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/beware-unclaimed-money-scam/story?id=14293877#.T-aW4StYuxI|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one variant of 419 fraud, an alleged [[hitman]] writes to someone explaining he has been targeted to kill them. He tells them he knows the allegations against them are false, and asks for money so the target can receive evidence of the person who ordered the hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snopes_Hitman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|title=Hitman Scam.|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/hitman.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of advanced fee fraud is known as a pigeon drop. This is a [[confidence trick]] in which the [[Mark (victim)|mark]], or &quot;[[pigeon]]&quot;, is persuaded to give up a sum of money in order to secure the rights to a larger sum of money, or more valuable object.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} In reality, the scammers make off with the money and the mark is left with nothing. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money (in an envelope, briefcase, or bag) which the mark is then apparently entrusted with; it is actually switched for a bag full of newspaper or other worthless material. Through various theatrics, the mark is given the opportunity to leave with the money without the stranger realizing. In reality, the mark would be fleeing from his own money, which the con man still has (or has handed off to an [[accomplice]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zak_Paul&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|title=How to Run a Con|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-moral-molecule/200811/how-run-con|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scammers will go after the victims of previous scams; known as a [[reloading scam]]. For example, they may contact a victim saying they can track and apprehend the scammer and recover the money lost by the victim, for a price. Or they may say a fund has been set up by the Nigerian government to compensate victims of 419 fraud, and all that is required is proof of the loss, personal information, and a processing and handling fee. The recovery scammers obtain lists of victims by buying them from the original scammers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snopes_Victim_Scam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Mikkelson|title=Scam Me Twice, Shame On Me, ...|url=https://www.snopes.com/scam-me-twice-shame-on-me/|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Estimates of the total losses due to the scam are uncertain and vary widely, since many people may be too embarrassed to admit that they were gullible enough to be scammed to report the crime. A United States government report in 2006 indicated that Americans lost $198.4 million to Internet fraud in 2006, averaging a loss of $5,100 per incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg_Eric&quot;/&gt; That same year, a report in the United Kingdom claimed that these scams cost the economy [[British pound|£]]150 million per year, with the average victim losing £31,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK_economy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria scams 'cost UK billions'.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6163700.stm|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the financial cost, many victims also suffer a severe emotional and psychological cost, such as losing their ability to trust people.

Victims can be enticed to borrow or embezzle money to pay the advance fees, believing that they will shortly be paid a much larger sum and be able to refund what they misappropriated.

Some 419 scams involve even more serious crimes, such as [[kidnapping]] or [[murder]]. One such case, in 2008, involves Osamai Hitomi, a Japanese businessman who was lured to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa and kidnapped on September 26, 2008. The kidnappers took him to [[Alberton, Gauteng|Alberton]], south of Johannesburg, and demanded a $5 million ransom from his family.

The international nature of the crime, combined with the fact that many victims do not want to admit that they bought into an illegal activity, has made tracking down and apprehending these criminals difficult. Furthermore, the government of Nigeria has been slow to take action, leading some investigators to believe that some Nigerian government officials are involved in some of these scams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sine_Richard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sine|first=Richard|title=Just Deposit $28 Million|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/05.02.96/nigeria-9618.html|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]]|date=May 2–8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigeria government's establishment of the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) in 2004 helped with the issue to some degree, although issues with corruption remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFCC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oluwarotimi_Abiodun&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Oluwarotimi|first=Abiodun|title=Nigeria: Police Force Is Corrupt, EFCC Not Sincere - U.S.|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201205270236.html|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[AllAfrica.com]]|date=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable case which the EFCC pursued was that of [[Emmanuel Nwude]], who was convicted for defrauding $242 million out of the director of a Brazilian bank, [[Banco Macro|Banco Noroeste]], which ultimately led to the bank's collapse. Also the [https://google.com SARS] (Special Anti-Robbery Squad), a division of the Nigerian Police Force lately has been apprehending suspected fraud perpetrators.

Despite this, there have been some recent successes in apprehending and prosecuting these criminals.

'''Human Rights Watch''' ('''HRW''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]], headquartered in [[New York City]], that conducts research and [[advocacy]] on [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/75138|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2015-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104193654/http://www.hrw.org/node/75138|archive-date=2015-01-04|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group pressures governments, policy makers, companies, and individual human rights abusers to denounce abuse and respect human rights, and the group often works on behalf of refugees, children, migrants, and political prisoners.

Human Rights Watch in 1997 shared in the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] as a founding member of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] and it played a leading role in the [[2008 treaty banning cluster munitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/history|title=History|date=21 April 2015|access-date=8 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508233353/https://www.hrw.org/history|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its [[Europe]]an partners, Helsinki Watch says it contributed to the [[democracy|democratic]] transformations of the region in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH&quot; /&gt;

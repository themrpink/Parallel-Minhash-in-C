The Norse established their parliament on the [[Tinganes]] peninsula in AD 850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torshavn.fo/Default.aspx?pageid=620|title=Tórshavn Municipality|website=Tórshavn Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tórshavn thus became the capital of the Faroe Islands and has remained so ever since. All through the [[Middle Ages]] the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of Tórshavn. Early on, Tórshavn became the centre of the islands' trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
It is not known whether the site of Tórshavn was of interest to the Celtic monks who were [[History of the Faroe Islands|probably the first settlers]] in the Faroes.  The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called ''[[Thing (assembly)|tings]]'', in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the ''ting'' at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage.  The main ''ting'' for the islands was convoked in Tórshavn in 825, on [[Tinganes]], the [[peninsula]] that divides the harbour into two parts: ''Eystaravág'' and ''Vestaravág''. 

The Vikings would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The [[Færeyinga Saga]] says: &quot;the place of the ''ting'' of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called Tórshavn&quot;. The Viking age ended in 1035. The ''ting'' was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area.

All through the [[Middle Ages]], the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of Tórshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, Tórshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in [[Bergen]]. 

In 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in Tórshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to Tórshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. Tórshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than did the other villages.  Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made Tórshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that Tórshavn was the seat of the ''ting'' of the islands, influenced the town's development.

=== 1500–1800 ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[File:Tórshavn skansin 8.jpg|thumb|[[Skansin]] fort has been rebuilt several times since it was first built in 1580. The current building dates back to 1790]]

Sources do not mention a built-up area in Tórshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In ca. 1580 a small fort, [[Skansin]], was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader [[Magnus Heinason]] at the north end of the harbour. Later small fortifications were built at Tinganes.

In 1584 Tórshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless [[proletariat]] from the villages that during this period came to Tórshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers.

In 1655 king [[Frederick III of Denmark]] granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman [[Kristoffer Gabel]], the rule of the von Gabel Family, 1655–1709, is known as ''Gablatíðin''. It is the darkest chapter in the history of Tórshavn. Gabel's administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family's hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in Tórshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the [[bailiff]] and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel's documents.

Conditions improved in Tórshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The [[Danish Royal Trade Monopoly in the Faroe Islands|Danish royal trade monopoly]] was supplied with goods from [[Copenhagen]] three times a year. However, in 1709 Tórshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox, killing nearly the entire population. The town had by this time reached a population of 300 and 250 of the inhabitants died. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that Tórshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 and during the next 20 years onwards Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to England. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In Tórshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened.

[[Tórshavn Cathedral]] was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]]).

=== 1800–present ===
[[File:Recherche Expedition 1839 Tórshavn.jpg|thumb|left|Tórshavn in 1839, by Barthélemy Lauvergne]]
On 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish [[Gunboat War]], the [[Cruizer class brig-sloop]] [[HMS Clio (1807)|HMS ''Clio'']] entered Tórshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The ''Clio''s men [[Touch hole#Spiking the guns|spiked]] the fort's eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May a German privateer who had assumed the name &quot;Baron von Hompesch&quot; plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Logting 1864, faroe islands.jpg|thumb|Tórshavn in 1864, the [[Løgting]] (parliament) is at top left]]
In 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with Tórshavn at its centre. The farming land was rented to townspeople who could later buy it if they wished.  These small plots of land enabled people to keep cows and sheep.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1866, Tórshavn's town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, Tórshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns. In 1913, the Danish [[Folketing]] granted DKK 810,000 to construction of a harbour in Tórshavn. Local waves are 3m, the waters are icefree and have a tidal variation of 0.3m, and storms from the west are mitigated by the gentle eastwards slope of the mountains. Other harbours were also benefitted with an 80% grant to a total build cost of DKK 1.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=ing1913&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jagd |first1=N |url=http://www.e-pages.dk/ingarkiv/3131/15 |title=Havne paa Færøerne |website=e-pages.dk |page=505—513|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]] |date=27 September 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Tórshavn had a modern harbour built. This made it possible for larger ships to berth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregoriussen 11-15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gregoriussen, Jákup Pauli|year=2000|title=Tórshavn, vár miðstøð og borg II. Tekningar úr Havn|location=Velbastaður|publisher=Forlagið í Støplum|isbn=99918-914-4-7|language=fo|pages=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II]], Skansin was used as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Command, and two 5.5-inch guns used aboard {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} before World War II were deployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_55-50_mk1.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;British
5.5&quot;/50 (14 cm) BL Mark I&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the neighbouring villages [[Hoyvík]] and [[Hvítanes]] were made part of the town area. Later, even more municipalities joined the Tórshavn municipality. In 1978 Kaldbak, in 1997 Argir, in 2001 Kollafjørður, and finally in 2005, Kirkjubøur, Hestur, and Nólsoy.

[[File:Tórshavn.2009.5.jpg|thumb|Tórshavn Harbour Ferry Terminal, view towards [[Tinganes]] and 'Vesturbýur' ''The Western Town'']]
Tórshavn features a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] (''[[Köppen climate classification|Cfc]]'') with average summer highs around {{convert|12|C|F|abbr=on}} and average winter highs around {{convert|6|C|F|abbr=on}}, and with winter lows averaging just above freezing, and frequent cloudy skies. Average monthly precipitation is highest in autumn and winter, peaking in January, owing to frequent, intense storms crossing the area from the North Atlantic Ocean, while May and June are markedly drier months. 

Because of the cloudy weather and the ice-free water surrounding Tórshavn, its winter temperatures are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location. However, summer temperatures are much lower than those found in continental Scandinavia on similar parallels. The temperature amplitude in the period from 1961 to 2010 is a mere {{convert|33|C-change}} between the absolute warmest and coldest temperatures.

== Politics and government ==

Tórshavn is the capital of the Faroe Islands, and as such is the seat of the Faroes’ [[Cabinet of the Faroe Islands|self rule government]]. The government holds the executive power in local government affairs. Today a part of the government is located on the [[Tinganes]] peninsula of Tórshavn, the Prime Minister's office is here and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was here until it was closed in 2013. The other ministries are located in other office buildings in various places in Tórshavn, i.e. the Ministry of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-health-affairs/ |title=Ministry of Health Affairs |website=The government of the Faroe Islands |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711033914/http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-health-affairs/ |archivedate=11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ministry of Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-social-affairs/|title=Ministry of Social Affairs|website=The government of the Faroe Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; are located near the [[Landssjúkrahúsið|Hospital of the Faroes]] in Eirargarður, and the Ministry of Finance is located in [[Argir]] in a building called Albert Hall on the street Kvíggjartún.&lt;ref name=&quot;fmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.government.fo/the-government/ministries/ministry-of-finance/ | title=Ministry of Finance |website=The government of the Faroe Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament, the [[Løgting]], which was originally located on Tinganes, was relocated to the town square, Vaglið, in 1856.

[[File:Drekin a Faroese Row Boat.jpg|thumb|A boat race at the Jóansøka Festival in Tvøroyri in June 2011.]]

Tórshavn, as the capital city, is the centre of sport in the islands; the largest sports centre is located in the [[Gundadalur]] district of Tórshavn. Also, the largest football stadium, [[Tórsvøllur]], is located here, seating 6,000 spectators. The stadium serves as home to the [[Faroe Islands national football team]]. Around the city there are also two other football pitches, indoor tennis courts, badminton courts and a swimming pool.

The city has several football clubs, including three [[Faroe Islands Premier League|Premier League]] teams: [[HB Tórshavn]], [[B36 Tórshavn]] and [[Argja Bóltfelag]]. Other football clubs with connections to the city are [[FF Giza]] ([[Nólsoy]]), [[FC Hoyvík]] and [[Undrið FF]]. [[Team handball|Handball]] is the second most popular sport in Tórshavn. The city's handball teams are [[Kyndil]], [[Neistin]] and [[Ítróttafelagið H71]] and the [[Faroe Islands national handball team|Faroe Island's national handball team]] practice in the city. Tórshavn city has several popular [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs, including, [[Havnar Róðrarfelag]] and [[Róðrarfelagið Knørrur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isf.fo/?page_id=623#51|title=ISF.fo Faroese confederation of sports and Olympic committee|work=Ítróttasamband Føroya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year in July the [[Tour of Faroe Islands]], which is a [[road bicycle race]], is held around the islands. The race is called ''Kring Føroyar'' (Tour de Faroe / Around the Faroes), it starts in [[Klaksvík]] and ends in Tórshavn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsf.fo//tour+of+faroe+island+2012.html|title=Effo Kring Føroyar (Tour de Faroe)|website=Tórshavnar súkklufelag (Bycycle club of Tórshavn)|language=fo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
The Tórshavn Jazz Festival has been held annually since 1983. It attracts musicians from all over North America and Europe and has become a popular tourist event.

== Transport ==
[[File:Torshavn.png|upright|thumb|A map of Tórshavn showing road links]] 
{{See also|Transport in the Faroe Islands}}
The harbour is served by the [[Smyril Line]] international ferry service to [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]]. The harbour is also used by domestic ferry services of [[Strandfaraskip Landsins]] within the Faroe Islands, chiefly on the route to [[Tvøroyri]].

The town is served by [[Transport in the Faroe Islands#Bus services|Bussleiðin]] – a network of local buses, with the service identified by its red livery. Tórshavn's Bussleiðin has five routes and is operated by the Tórshavn municipality. Buses within Tórshavn have been completely free of charge since 2007. This is a green initiative intended to persuade people to use public transportation rather than drive their cars. Like Bygdaleiðir, the actual buses are privately owned, but contracted to Bussleiðin. Buses also depart to villages throughout the islands. In addition, there is a helipad by the coast.

'''Reading''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Reading.ogg|ˈ|r|ɛ|d|ɪ|ŋ}} {{respell|RED|ing}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/reading?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Reading|accessdate=23 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a large, historic [[market town]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]]. Situated in the [[Thames Valley]] at the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Kennet|Kennet]], it is on the [[Great Western Main Line]] railway and the [[M4 motorway]]. Reading is {{convert|40|mi|km}} east of [[Swindon]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of London, {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Basingstoke]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} southwest of [[Maidenhead]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].

The first evidence for Reading as a town dates from the 8th century. It was an important trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, as the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of medieval England with strong royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. The medieval town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre.

Reading is a major commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and despite its proximity to London, has a net inward commuter flow. It is ranked the UK's top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Good Growth for Cities 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government &amp; public sector|work=PwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading is also a major regional retail centre serving a large area of the Thames Valley, and is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], [[Reading City F.C.]] and [[London Irish]] rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the [[Reading Half Marathon]].

In 2018, the '''Borough of Reading''' had 163,203 residents&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadingUnitary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/admin/reading/E06000038__reading/|title=Reading (Unitary District, Reading, United Kingdom) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the wider [[Reading/Wokingham Urban Area|urban area]] had 337,108 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReadingUA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/englandua/?cityid=7246|title=United Kingdom: Urban Areas in England - Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information|website=City Population|accessdate=23 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borough is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|two]] [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|members]], and has been continuously represented there since 1295. For [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial purposes]], Reading has served as the [[county town]] of Berkshire since 1867, previously sharing this status with [[Abingdon-on-Thames]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Reading, Berkshire}}
{{see also|Timeline of Reading, Berkshire}}

===Early years===
Occupation at the site of Reading may date back to the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], possibly in the form of a trading port for [[Calleva Atrebatum]].{{sfn|Lawes Long|1836|p=11–13}} However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town came to be known as ''Readingum''. The name probably comes from the ''[[Readingas]]'', an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribe whose name means ''Reada's People'' in [[Old English]].{{sfn|Cameron|1961|p=64}} In late 870, an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] invaded the kingdom of [[Wessex]] and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]], [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=14–15}}{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}

After the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of [[Battle Abbey]]. In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}} [[Reading Abbey]] was founded in 1121 by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], who is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands in Reading, along with land at [[Cholsey]].{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}{{sfn|Slade|2001|p=1–16}} 

Reading was an important river crossing point: in 1312, King [[Edward II]] directed that its bridges should be kept in good order. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maxwell Lyte |first1=H.C. |title=Close Rolls, Edward II: November 1312 Pages 556-559 Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward II: Volume 1, 1307-1313. Originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1892. |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-close-rolls/edw2/vol1/pp556-559 |website=British History Online |accessdate=20 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how badly Reading was affected by the [[Black Death]] that swept through England in the 14th century, but it is known that the abbot of Reading Abbey, [[Henry of Appleford]], was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]] lost 60% of its population.{{sfn|Hylton|2007|p=34–38}} The Abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]]. The last abbot, [[Hugh Faringdon]], was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in front of the Abbey Church.{{sfn|Slade|2001|p=17–25}}{{sfn|Fasham|Hawkes|1983}} 

[[File:Map of Redding by John Speed, 1611.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest map of Reading, published in 1611 by [[John Speed]]]]
By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant [[John Kendrick (cloth merchant)|John Kendrick]].{{sfn|Hylton|2007|p=34–38}} {{sfn|Hylton|2007|p=51–52}} Reading played an important role during the [[English Civil War]]. Despite its fortifications, it had a Royalist garrison imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent [[Siege of Reading]] by Parliamentary forces succeeded in April 1643.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, Malcolm: ''The Siege of Reading: The Failure of the Earl of Essex's 1643 Spring Offensive''. Ottawa, EbooksLib, 2004 {{ISBN|1-55449-999-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The town's cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town's economy did not fully recover until the 20th century.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_siege.html | title = The Siege of Reading | accessdate = 27 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307011752/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_siege.html | archive-date = 7 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading played a significant role during the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]]: the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|second Battle of Reading]] was the only substantial military action of the campaign.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | title = The Battle of Broad Street | accessdate = 27 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926092425/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | archive-date = 26 September 2008 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Reading from Caversham by Joseph Farington, 1793.jpg|thumb|left|''View of Reading from [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]'' by [[Joseph Farington]] in 1793]]
The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous.{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=84–89}} Reading's trade benefited from better designed [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike]] roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to [[Oxford]] and the [[West Country]]. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the [[Kennet Navigation]] opened the River Kennet to boats as far as [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town. After the opening of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] in 1810, one could go by barge from Reading to the [[Bristol Channel]].{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=75–80}} From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of [[county town]] of Berkshire was shared between Reading and [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QuarterSessions&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Berkshire Quarter Sessions |newspaper=Jackson's Oxford Journal |date=4 July 1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hunter|1995|p=103}}

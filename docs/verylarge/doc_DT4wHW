Structural instability phenomena are of particular concern for plasmid manufacture, DNA vaccination and gene therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliveira PH, Prather KJ, Prazeres DM, Monteiro GA | title = Structural instability of plasmid biopharmaceuticals: challenges and implications | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 503–11 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19656584 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessory regions pertaining to the plasmid backbone may engage in a wide range of structural instability phenomena. Well-known catalysts of genetic instability include direct, inverted and tandem repeats, which are conspicuous in many commercially available cloning and expression vectors. Therefore, the reduction or complete elimination of extraneous noncoding backbone sequences would pointedly reduce the propensity for such events to take place and consequently the overall plasmid's recombinogenic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliveira PH, Mairhofer J | title = Marker-free plasmids for biotechnological applications - implications and perspectives | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 539–47 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23830144 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of plasmids ===
Once the plasmid inserts itself into the transfected cell nucleus, it codes for a peptide string of a foreign antigen. On its surface the cell displays the foreign antigen with both histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and class II molecules. The antigen-presenting cell then travels to the lymph nodes and presents the antigen peptide and costimulatory molecule signaled by T-cell, initiating the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kutzler MA, Weiner DB | title = DNA vaccines: ready for prime time? | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 776–88 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18781156 | pmc = 4317294 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccine insert design ===

Immunogens can be targeted to various cellular compartments to improve antibody or cytotoxic T-cell responses. Secreted or [[plasma membrane]]-bound antigens are more effective at inducing antibody responses than [[cytosolic]] antigens, while [[cytotoxic T-cell]] responses can be improved by targeting antigens for cytoplasmic degradation and subsequent entry into the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class I pathway.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; This is usually accomplished by the addition of [[N-terminal]] [[ubiquitin]] signals.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez F, Zhang J, Whitton JL | title = DNA immunization: ubiquitination of a viral protein enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte induction and antiviral protection but abrogates antibody induction | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 11 | pages = 8497–503 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9343207 | pmc = 192313 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8497-8503.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobery1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tobery TW, Siliciano RF | title = Targeting of HIV-1 antigens for rapid intracellular degradation enhances cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition and the induction of de novo CTL responses in vivo after immunization | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 185 | issue = 5 | pages = 909–20 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9120397 | pmc = 2196169 | doi = 10.1084/jem.185.5.909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huebener N, Fest S, Strandsby A, Michalsky E, Preissner R, Zeng Y, Gaedicke G, Lode HN | title = A rationally designed tyrosine hydroxylase DNA vaccine induces specific antineuroblastoma immunity | journal = Molecular Cancer Therapeutics | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 2241–51 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18645033 | doi = 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0109 | authorlink8 = Lode HN, Fest S, Strandsby A, Michalsky E, Preissner R, Zeng Y, Gaedicke G, Lode HN | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[protein conformation|conformation]] of the protein can also affect antibody responses. “Ordered” structures (such as viral particles) are more effective than unordered structures.&lt;ref name=Wunderlich2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wunderlich G, Moura IC, del Portillo HA | title = Genetic immunization of BALB/c mice with a plasmid bearing the gene coding for a hybrid merozoite surface protein 1-hepatitis B virus surface protein fusion protects mice against lethal Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi PC1 infection | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | pages = 5839–45 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 10992493 | pmc = 101545 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.68.10.5839-5845.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strings of minigenes (or MHC class I [[epitopes]]) from different pathogens raise cytotoxic T-cell responses to some pathogens, especially if a TH epitope is also included.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

== Delivery ==

[[Image:Gene therapy.jpg|thumb|right|DNA vaccine and Gene therapy techniques are similar.]]
DNA vaccines have been introduced into animal tissues by multiple methods. The two most popular approaches were in 1999 injection of DNA in [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]: by using a standard hypodermic needle; or by using a [[gene gun]] delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiner1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner DB, Kennedy RC | year = 1999 | title = Genetic vaccines | journal = Scientific American | volume = 281 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–41 | url = http://www.sciamdigital.com/gsp_qpdf.cfm?ISSUEID_CHAR=8FF32714-CA1C-4025-BE8D-0FE4B5C348B&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=14F98F90-1708-4B77-A8D4-44F867A153F | access-date = 2007-11-21 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0799-50 | pmid = 10396782 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325025916/http://www.sciam.com/media/inline/000052A5-43F6-1CBC-B4A8809EC588EEDF_arch2.gif | archive-date = 2009-03-25 | url-status = dead | bibcode = 1999SciAm.281a..50W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other techniques have been documented in the intervening years.

=== Saline injection ===

Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in [[skeletal muscle]], or [[dermis|intradermally]] (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted either 1) by [[electroporation]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Widera2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Widera G, Austin M, Rabussay D, Goldbeck C, Barnett SW, Chen M, Leung L, Otten GR, Thudium K, Selby MJ, Ulmer JB | title = Increased DNA vaccine delivery and immunogenicity by electroporation in vivo | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 164 | issue = 9 | pages = 4635–40 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10779767 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.164.9.4635 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with [[myotoxins]] such as [[bupivacaine]]; or 3) by using [[hypertonic]] solutions of saline or [[sucrose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt; Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedegah1994&quot; /&gt; needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt;

=== Gene gun ===
[[Gene gun]] delivery ballistically accelerates plasmid DNA (pDNA) that has been absorbed onto [[gold]] or [[tungsten]] microparticles into the target cells, using compressed [[helium]] as an accelerant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1999&quot; /&gt;

=== Mucosal surface delivery ===
Alternatives included [[aerosol]] instillation of naked DNA on [[mucosal]] surfaces, such as the [[human nose|nasal]] and [[human lung|lung]] [[mucosa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1999&quot; /&gt; and topical administration of pDNA to the eye&lt;ref name=&quot;Daheshia1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daheshia M, Kuklin N, Kanangat S, Manickan E, Rouse BT | title = Suppression of ongoing ocular inflammatory disease by topical administration of plasmid DNA encoding IL-10 | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages = 1945–52 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9257860 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/4/1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaginal mucosa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1999&quot; /&gt; Mucosal surface delivery has also been achieved using cationic [[liposome]]-DNA preparations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson2000&quot; /&gt; [[biodegradable]] microspheres,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Y, Webster RG, Woodland DL | title = Induction of CD8+ T cell responses to dominant and subdominant epitopes and protective immunity to Sendai virus infection by DNA vaccination | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 160 | issue = 5 | pages = 2425–32 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9498786 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/5/2425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1999&quot; /&gt; attenuated ''[[Salmonella|Salmonalla]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lode HN, Huebener N, Zeng Y, Fest S, Weixler S, Gaedicke G | title = DNA minigene vaccination for adjuvant neuroblastoma therapy | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1028 | issue =  1| pages = 113–21 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15650237 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1322.012 | bibcode = 2004NYASA1028..113L | s2cid = 27240738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shigella]]'' or ''[[Listeria]]'' vectors for oral administration to the intestinal mucosa&lt;ref name=&quot;Sizemore1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sizemore DR, Branstrom AA, Sadoff JC | title = Attenuated Shigella as a DNA delivery vehicle for DNA-mediated immunization | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5234 | pages = 299–302 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7569980 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5234.299 | bibcode = 1995Sci...270..299S | s2cid = 12532901 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1231043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recombinant adenovirus vectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1999&quot; /&gt;

===Polymer vehicle===
A hybrid vehicle composed of bacteria cell and synthetic [[polymers]] has been employed for DNA vaccine delivery. An ''[[E. coli]]'' inner core and poly(beta-amino ester) outer coat function synergistically to increase efficiency by addressing barriers associated with [[antigen-presenting cell]] gene delivery which include cellular uptake and internalization, [[phagocytosis|phagosomal]] escape and intracellular cargo concentration. Tested in mice, the hybrid vector was found to induce immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2014/11/035.html |title=A hybrid vehicle that delivers DNA|author=Nealon, Cory|publisher=The State University of New York at Buffalo|date=25 November 2014|access-date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones CH, Ravikrishnan A, Chen M, Reddinger R, Kamal Ahmadi M, Rane S, Hakansson AP, Pfeifer BA | title = Hybrid biosynthetic gene therapy vector development and dual engineering capacity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 34 | pages = 12360–5 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25114239 | pmc = 4151754 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1411355111 | display-authors = 1 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112360J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ELI immunization===
Another approach to DNA vaccination is [[expression library]] immunization (ELI). Using this technique, potentially all the genes from a pathogen can be delivered at one time, which may be useful for pathogens that are difficult to attenuate or culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt; ELI can be used to identify which genes induce a protective response. This has been tested with ''[[Mycoplasma]] pulmonis'', a [[murine]] lung pathogen with a relatively small [[genome]]. Even partial expression libraries can induce protection from subsequent challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barry MA, Lai WC, Johnston SA | s2cid = 4306972 | title = Protection against mycoplasma infection using expression-library immunization | journal = Nature | volume = 377 | issue = 6550 | pages = 632–5 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7566175 | doi = 10.1038/377632a0 | bibcode = 1995Natur.377..632B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dosage ==
The delivery method determines the dose required to raise an effective immune response. Saline injections require variable amounts of DNA, from 10&amp;nbsp;μg to 1&amp;nbsp;mg, whereas gene gun deliveries require 100 to 1000 times less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fynan1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fynan EF, Webster RG, Fuller DH, Haynes JR, Santoro JC, Robinson HL | title = DNA vaccines: protective immunizations by parenteral, mucosal, and gene-gun inoculations | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 24 | pages = 11478–82 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8265577 | pmc = 48007 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.24.11478 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...9011478F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, 0.2&amp;nbsp;μg – 20&amp;nbsp;μg are required, although quantities as low as 16&amp;nbsp;ng have been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt; These quantities vary by species. Mice for example, require approximately 10 times less DNA than [[primates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson2000&quot; /&gt; Saline injections require more DNA because the DNA is delivered to the extracellular spaces of the target tissue (normally muscle), where it has to overcome physical barriers (such as the [[basal lamina]] and large amounts of [[connective tissue]]) before it is taken up by the cells, while gene gun deliveries drive/force DNA directly into the cells, resulting in less “wastage”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alarcon1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson2000&quot; /&gt;

== Immune response ==

=== Helper T cell responses ===

[[Image:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|right|Antigen presentation stimulates T cells to become either &quot;cytotoxic&quot; CD8+ cells or &quot;helper&quot; CD4+ cells. Cytotoxic cells directly attack other cells carrying certain foreign or abnormal molecules on their surfaces. Helper T cells, or Th cells, coordinate immune responses by communicating with other cells. In most cases, T cells only recognize an antigen if it is carried on the surface of a cell by one of the body's own MHC, or major histocompatibility complex, molecules.]]
DNA immunization can raise multiple T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; responses, including lymphoproliferation and the generation of a variety of [[cytokine]] profiles. A major advantage of DNA vaccines is the ease with which they can be manipulated to bias the type of T-cell help towards a TH1 or TH2 response.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feltquate DM, Heaney S, Webster RG, Robinson HL | title = Different T helper cell types and antibody isotypes generated by saline and gene gun DNA immunization | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 2278–84 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9036975 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/5/2278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type has distinctive patterns of [[lymphokine]] and chemokine expression, specific types of [[immunoglobulins]], patterns of lymphocyte trafficking and types of [[innate immune response]]s.

==== Other types of T-cell help ====

The type of T-cell help raised is influenced by the delivery method and the type of immunogen expressed, as well as the targeting of different lymphoid compartments.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyle CM, Morin M, Webster RG, Robinson HL | title = Role of different lymphoid tissues in the initiation and maintenance of DNA-raised antibody responses to the influenza virus H1 glycoprotein | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | pages = 9074–8 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8971047 | pmc = 191015 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.70.12.9074-9078.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, saline needle injections (either IM or ID) tend to induce TH1 responses, while gene gun delivery raises TH2 responses.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt; This is true for intracellular and plasma membrane-bound antigens, but not for secreted antigens, which seem to generate TH2 responses, regardless of the method of delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sällberg1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sällberg M, Townsend K, Chen M, O'Dea J, Banks T, Jolly DJ, Chang SM, Lee WT, Milich DR | title = Characterization of humoral and CD4+ cellular responses after genetic immunization with retroviral vectors expressing different forms of the hepatitis B virus core and e antigens | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 7 | pages = 5295–303 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9188598 | pmc = 191766 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5295-5303.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the type of T-cell help raised is stable over time, and does not change when challenged or after subsequent immunizations that would normally have raised the opposite type of response in a naïve specimen.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt; However, Mor ''et al.''. (1995)&lt;ref name=Mor1995 /&gt; immunized and boosted mice with pDNA encoding the circumsporozoite protein of the mouse [[malaria]]l parasite ''[[Plasmodium yoelii]]'' (PyCSP) and found that the initial TH2 response changed, after boosting, to a TH1 response.

==== Basis for different types of T-cell help ====

How these different methods operate, the forms of antigen expressed, and the different profiles of T-cell help is not understood. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection were responsible for the induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence shows no dose-related differences in TH type.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt; The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of [[antigen presenting cells]]. [[Dendritic cells]] can differentiate to secrete [[interleukin|IL-12]] (which supports TH1 cell development) or [[Interleukin-4 receptor|IL-4]] (which supports TH2 responses).&lt;ref name=Banchereau1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banchereau J, Steinman RM | s2cid = 4388748 | title = Dendritic cells and the control of immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6673 | pages = 245–52 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9521319 | doi = 10.1038/32588 | authorlink1 = Jacques Banchereau | bibcode = 1998Natur.392..245B }}&lt;/ref&gt; pDNA injected by needle is [[endocytosis|endocytosed]] into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 [[cytokine]] production,&lt;ref name=Jakob1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jakob T, Walker PS, Krieg AM, Udey MC, Vogel JC | title = Activation of cutaneous dendritic cells by CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides: a role for dendritic cells in the augmentation of Th1 responses by immunostimulatory DNA | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 161 | issue = 6 | pages = 3042–9 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9743369 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/6/3042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.

==== Practical uses of polarised T-cell help ====

Polarisation in T-cell help is useful in influencing [[allergic]] responses and [[autoimmune diseases]]. In autoimmune diseases, the goal is to shift the self-destructive TH1 response (with its associated cytotoxic T cell activity) to a non-destructive TH2 response. This has been successfully applied in predisease priming for the desired type of response in preclinical models&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; and is somewhat successful in shifting the response for an established disease.&lt;ref name=Raz1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raz E, Tighe H, Sato Y, Corr M, Dudler JA, Roman M, Swain SL, Spiegelberg HL, Carson DA | title = Preferential induction of a Th1 immune response and inhibition of specific IgE antibody formation by plasmid DNA immunization | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 10 | pages = 5141–5 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8643542 | pmc = 39421 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.10.5141 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.5141R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytotoxic T-cell responses ===

One of the advantages of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes,&lt;ref name=Fu1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu TM, Friedman A, Ulmer JB, Liu MA, Donnelly JJ | title = Protective cellular immunity: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against dominant and recessive epitopes of influenza virus nucleoprotein induced by DNA immunization | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 2715–21 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9060624 | pmc = 191393 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.4.2715-2721.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subdominant CTL epitopes,&lt;ref name=Chen1998 /&gt; in a manner that appears to mimic natural [[infection]]. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.

Cytotoxic T-cells recognise small [[peptides]] (8-10 [[amino acids]]) complexed to [[MHC class I]] molecules.&lt;ref name=Restifo1995 /&gt; These peptides are derived from endogenous cytosolic proteins that are degraded and delivered to the nascent MHC class I molecule within the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER).&lt;ref name=Restifo1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Restifo NP, Bacík I, Irvine KR, Yewdell JW, McCabe BJ, Anderson RW, Eisenlohr LC, Rosenberg SA, Bennink JR | title = Antigen processing in vivo and the elicitation of primary CTL responses | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 154 | issue = 9 | pages = 4414–22 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7722298 | pmc = 1952186 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/154/9/4414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting gene products directly to the ER (by the addition of an [[amino-terminal]] insertion [[protein sequence|sequence]]) should thus enhance CTL responses. This was successfully demonstrated using recombinant [[vaccinia]] viruses expressing [[influenza]] proteins,&lt;ref name=Restifo1995 /&gt; but the principle should also be applicable to DNA vaccines.

=== Humoral (antibody) response ===

[[Image:Antibody.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of an antibody and antigens]]
Antibody responses elicited by DNA vaccinations are influenced by multiple variables, including antigen type; antigen location (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted); number, frequency and immunization dose; site and method of antigen delivery.

==== Kinetics of antibody response ====

Humoral responses after a single DNA injection can be much longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against [[hepatitis B]] virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza [[haemagglutinin]] was demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery.&lt;ref name=Justewicz1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Justewicz DM, Webster RG | title = Long-term maintenance of B cell immunity to influenza virus hemagglutinin in mice following DNA-based immunization | journal = Virology | volume = 224 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–7 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8862394 | doi = 10.1006/viro.1996.0501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the [[bone marrow]] and [[spleen]] for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.&lt;ref name=Justewicz1996 /&gt;

Comparisons of antibody responses generated by natural (viral) infection, immunization with recombinant protein and immunization with pDNA are summarised in Table 4. DNA-raised antibody responses rise much more slowly than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. As many as 12 weeks may be required to reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can decrease the interval. This response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response. DNA vaccine expressing HBV small and middle envelope protein was injected into adults with chronic hepatitis. The vaccine resulted in specific interferon gamma cell production. Also specific T-cells for middle envelop proteins antigens were developed. The immune response of the patients was not robust enough to control HBV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancini-Bourgine M, Fontaine H, Bréchot C, Pol S, Michel ML | title = Immunogenicity of a hepatitis B DNA vaccine administered to chronic HBV carriers | journal = Vaccine | volume = 24 | issue = 21 | pages = 4482–9 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16310901 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the titres of specific antibodies raised by DNA vaccination are lower than those obtained after vaccination with a recombinant protein. However, DNA immunization-induced antibodies show greater affinity to native epitopes than recombinant protein-induced antibodies. In other words, DNA immunization induces a qualitatively superior response. Antibodies can be induced after one vaccination with DNA, whereas recombinant protein vaccinations generally require a boost. DNA immunization can be used to bias the TH profile of the immune response and thus the antibody isotype, which is not possible with either natural infection or recombinant protein immunization. Antibody responses generated by DNA are useful as a preparative tool. For example, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be generated for use as reagents.

== Mechanistic basis for DNA-raised immune responses ==

=== DNA uptake mechanism ===

When DNA uptake and subsequent expression was first demonstrated ''in vivo'' in [[muscle]] cells,&lt;ref name=Wolff1992&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JA, Dowty ME, Jiao S, Repetto G, Berg RK, Ludtke JJ, Williams P, Slautterback DB | title = Expression of naked plasmids by cultured myotubes and entry of plasmids into T tubules and caveolae of mammalian skeletal muscle | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 103 ( Pt 4) | issue = 4 | pages = 1249–59 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1487500 | url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1487500 | series = 103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these cells were thought to be unique because of their extensive network of T-tubules. Using [[electron microscopy]], it was proposed that DNA uptake was facilitated by [[caveolae]] (or, non-clathrin coated pits).&lt;ref name=Anderson1992&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson RG, Kamen BA, Rothberg KG, Lacey SW | title = Potocytosis: sequestration and transport of small molecules by caveolae | journal = Science | volume = 255 | issue = 5043 | pages = 410–1 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1310359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1310359 | bibcode = 1992Sci...255..410A }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research revealed that other cells (such as [[keratinocytes]], [[fibroblasts]] and [[epithelial]] [[Langerhans cells]]) could also internalize DNA.&lt;ref name=Raz1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casares1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casares S, Inaba K, Brumeanu TD, Steinman RM, Bona CA | title = Antigen presentation by dendritic cells after immunization with DNA encoding a major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted viral epitope | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 186 | issue = 9 | pages = 1481–6 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9348305 | pmc = 2199124 | doi = 10.1084/jem.186.9.1481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of DNA uptake is not known.

Two theories dominate – that ''in vivo'' uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in a method similar to [[phagocytosis|phago]]- or [[pinocytosis]],&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; or through specific receptors.&lt;ref name=Bennett1985&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett RM, Gabor GT, Merritt MM | title = DNA binding to human leukocytes. Evidence for a receptor-mediated association, internalization, and degradation of DNA | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 76 | issue = 6 | pages = 2182–90 | date = December 1985 | pmid = 3001145 | pmc = 424340 | doi = 10.1172/JCI112226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These might include a 30kDa surface [[immune receptor|receptor]], or [[macrophage]] scavenger receptors. The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. Macrophage scavenger receptors bind to a variety of macromolecules, including poly[[ribonucleotides]] and are thus candidates for DNA uptake.&lt;ref name=Bennett1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennet1988&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennet RM, Hefeneider SH, Bakke A, Merritt M, Smith CA, Mourich D, Heinrich MC | title = The production and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies to a DNA receptor on human leukocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 140 | issue = 9 | pages = 2937–42 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2452195 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/140/9/2937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of [[guanine|polyguanylate sequences]]. Gene gun delivery systems, cationic liposome packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.

=== Antigen presentation by bone marrow-derived cells ===

[[Image:Dendritic cell.JPG|thumb|right|A dendritic cell.]]

Studies using [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] mice have shown that antigen is presented by bone-marrow derived cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages and specialised [[B-cells]] called professional [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC).&lt;ref name=Iwasaki1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Corr1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corr M, Lee DJ, Carson DA, Tighe H | title = Gene vaccination with naked plasmid DNA: mechanism of CTL priming | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 184 | issue = 4 | pages = 1555–60 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8879229 | pmc = 2192808 | doi = 10.1084/jem.184.4.1555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After gene gun inoculation to the skin, transfected [[Langerhans cell]]s migrate to the draining [[lymph node]] to present antigens.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; After IM and ID injections, dendritic cells present antigen in the draining lymph node&lt;ref name=Casares1997 /&gt; and transfected macrophages have been found in the peripheral blood.&lt;ref name=Chattergoon1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chattergoon MA, Robinson TM, Boyer JD, Weiner DB | title = Specific immune induction following DNA-based immunization through in vivo transfection and activation of macrophages/antigen-presenting cells | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 160 | issue = 12 | pages = 5707–18 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9637479 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/12/5707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides direct transfection of dendritic cells or macrophages, cross priming occurs following IM, ID and gene gun DNA deliveries. Cross-priming occurs when a bone marrow-derived cell presents peptides from proteins synthesised in another cell in the context of MHC class 1. This can prime cytotoxic T-cell responses and seems to be important for a full primary immune response.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torres1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torres CA, Iwasaki A, Barber BH, Robinson HL | title = Differential dependence on target site tissue for gene gun and intramuscular DNA immunizations | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 10 | pages = 4529–32 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9144463 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9144463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Target site role ===

IM and ID DNA delivery initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up and express antigens and are responsible for inducing a primary antibody response. Transfected Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem to act as a “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torres1997 /&gt;

=== Maintenance of immune response ===
DNA vaccination generates an effective immune memory via the display of antigen-antibody complexes on [[follicular dendritic cells]] (FDC), which are potent B-cell stimulators. T-cells can be stimulated by similar, germinal centre dendritic cells. FDC are able to generate an immune memory because antibodies production “overlaps” long-term expression of antigen, allowing antigen-antibody immunocomplexes to form and be displayed by FDC.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

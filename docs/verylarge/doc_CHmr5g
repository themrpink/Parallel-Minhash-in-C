During the same time as African Americans were being disenfranchised, white southerners imposed [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] by law. Violence against blacks increased, with numerous [[lynchings]] through the turn of the century. The system of ''[[de jure]]'' state-sanctioned racial discrimination and oppression that emerged from the post-Reconstruction South became known as the &quot;[[Jim Crow]]&quot; system. The United States Supreme Court, made up almost entirely of Northerners, upheld the constitutionality of those state laws that required [[racial segregation]] in public facilities in its 1896 decision ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', legitimizing them through the &quot;[[separate but equal]]&quot; doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rayford Logan]],''The Betrayal of the Negro from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson'', pp. 97–98. New York: Da Capo Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Litwack 2004&quot;&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were served first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Litwack 2004&quot; /&gt; Elected in 1912, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] gave in to demands by Southern members of his cabinet and ordered segregation of workplaces throughout the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kazin, Rebecca Edwards, Adam Rothman (2009). ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History''. p. 245. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century is a period often referred to as the &quot;[[nadir of American race relations]]&quot;, when the number of lynchings was highest. While tensions and [[civil rights]] violations were most intense in the South, social discrimination affected African Americans in other regions as well.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'', 3rd rev. ed. (Oxford University Press, 1974), pp. 67–109.&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, the Southern bloc controlled important committees in Congress, defeated passage of federal laws against lynching, and exercised considerable power beyond the number of whites in the South.

Characteristics of the post-Reconstruction period:
* [[Racial segregation]]. By law, public facilities and government services such as education were divided into separate &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/seglaws.htm Birmingham Segregation Laws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204031120/http://www.crmvet.org/info/seglaws.htm |date=February 4, 2011 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, those for colored were underfunded and of inferior quality.
* [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|Disenfranchisement]]. When white Democrats regained power, they passed laws that made voter registration more restrictive, essentially forcing black voters off the voting rolls. The number of African-American voters dropped dramatically, and they were no longer able to elect representatives. From 1890 to 1908, Southern states of the former Confederacy created constitutions with provisions that disfranchised tens of thousands of African Americans, and U.S. states such as Alabama disenfranchised poor whites as well.
* [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]]. Increased economic oppression of blacks through the [[convict lease]] system, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]], and [[Asian Pacific American|Asians]], denial of economic opportunities, and widespread employment discrimination.
* Violence. Individual, police, paramilitary, organizational, and [[Mass racial violence in the United States|mob racial violence against blacks]] (and Latinos in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and Asians in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]).

African Americans and other ethnic minorities rejected this regime. They resisted it in numerous ways and sought better opportunities through lawsuits, new organizations, political redress, and labor organizing (see the [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)]]). The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) was founded in 1909. It fought to end race discrimination through [[litigation]], education, and [[lobbying]] efforts. Its crowning achievement was its legal victory in the Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), when the [[Warren Court]] ruled that segregation of public schools in the US was unconstitutional and, by implication, overturned the &quot;[[separate but equal]]&quot; doctrine established in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' of 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Following the unanimous Supreme Court ruling, many states began to gradually integrate their schools, but some areas of the South resisted by closing public schools altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The integration of Southern public libraries followed demonstrations and protests that used techniques seen in other elements of the larger civil rights movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fultz, M. 2006&quot;&gt;Fultz, M. (2006). &quot;Black Public Libraries in the South in the Era of De Jure Segregation&quot;, ''Libraries &amp; The Cultural Record'', 41(3), 338–346.&lt;/ref&gt; This included sit-ins, beatings, and white resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fultz, M. 2006&quot; /&gt; For example, in 1963 in the city of [[Anniston, Alabama]], two black ministers were brutally beaten for attempting to integrate the public library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fultz, M. 2006&quot; /&gt; Though there was resistance and violence, the integration of libraries was generally quicker than the integration of other public institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fultz, M. 2006&quot; /&gt;

The situation for blacks outside the South was somewhat better (in most states they could vote and have their children educated, though they still faced discrimination in housing and jobs). In 1900 Reverend Matthew Anderson, speaking at the annual [[Hampton Negro Conference]] in Virginia, said that &quot;...the lines along most of the avenues of wage earning are more rigidly drawn in the North than in the South. There seems to be an apparent effort throughout the North, especially in the cities to debar the colored worker from all the avenues of higher remunerative labor, which makes it more difficult to improve his economic condition even than in the South.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Hampton Negro Conference|chapter=The Economic Aspect of the Negro Problem|first=Anderson|last=Matthew|editor1-last=Browne |editor1-first=Hugh |editor2-last=Kruse |editor2-first=Edwina |editor4-last=Moton |editor3-last=Walker |editor3-first=Thomas C. |editor4-first=Robert Russa |editor4-link=Robert Russa Moton |editor5-last=Wheelock |editor5-first=Frederick D. |publisher=Hampton Institute Press|location=[[Hampton, Virginia]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkQ9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|hdl=2027/chi.14025588?urlappend=%3Bseq=43|volume=4|year=1900|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1970, blacks sought better lives by migrating north and west out of the South. A total of nearly seven million blacks left the South in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], most during and after World War II. So many people migrated that the demographics of some previously black-majority states changed to a white majority (in combination with other developments). The rapid influx of blacks altered the demographics of Northern and Western cities; happening at a period of expanded European, Hispanic, and Asian immigration, it added to social competition and tensions, with the new migrants and immigrants battling for a place in jobs and housing.

[[Image:chicago-race-riot.jpg|thumb|right|A white gang looking for blacks during the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]]]]
Reflecting social tensions after World War I, as veterans struggled to return to the workforce and labor unions were organizing, the [[Red Summer]] of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of white race riots against blacks that took place in more than three dozen cities, such as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]] and the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]]. Urban problems such as crime and disease were blamed on the large influx of Southern blacks to cities in the north and west, based on stereotypes of rural southern African-Americans. Overall, blacks in Northern and Western cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of &quot;targeted violence, [[restrictive covenants]], [[redlining]] and racial steering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolnay |first=Stewart |s2cid=145520215 |title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |year=2003 |volume=29 |pages=218–221 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009 |jstor=30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Migration resulted in many African Americans becoming urbanized, and they began to realign from the Republican to the Democratic Party, especially because of opportunities under the [[New Deal]] of the [[Franklin D.

In 1948, President [[Harry Truman]] issued [[Executive Order 9981]], which ended [[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces|segregation in the military]].&lt;ref name=trumanlibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order 9981|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/9981.htm|publisher=Harry S.

[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|housing project]] erected this sign, [[Detroit]], 1942.]]

[[Housing segregation]] was a nationwide problem, widespread outside the South. Although the federal government had become increasingly involved in mortgage lending and development in the 1930s and 1940s, it did not reject the use of race-restrictive covenants until 1950, in part because of provisions by the Solid South Democrats in Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;propublica.org&quot; /&gt; Suburbanization became connected with [[white flight]] by this time, because whites were better established economically to move to newer housing. The situation was perpetuated by real estate agents' continuing [[Residential segregation|racial discrimination]]. In particular, from the 1930s to the 1960s, the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB) issued guidelines that specified that a realtor &quot;should never be instrumental in introducing to a neighborhood a character or property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individual whose presence will be clearly detrimental to property values in a neighborhood.&quot; The result was the development of all-black [[ghettos]] in the North and West, where much housing was older, as well as South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/fairhousing/historical.html |title=Future of Fair Housing: How We Got Here |access-date=July 29, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707035121/http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/fairhousing/historical.html |archive-date=July 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invigorated by the victory of ''Brown'' and frustrated by the lack of immediate practical effect, private citizens increasingly rejected gradualist, legalistic approaches as the primary tool to bring about [[desegregation]]. They were faced with &quot;[[massive resistance]]&quot; in the South by proponents of racial segregation and [[disfranchisement|voter suppression]]. In defiance, African-American activists adopted a combined strategy of [[direct action]], [[nonviolence]], [[nonviolent resistance]], and many events described as [[civil disobedience]], giving rise to the civil rights movement of 1954 to 1968.

=== Protest beginnings ===
The strategy of public education, legislative lobbying, and litigation that had typified the civil rights movement during the first half of the 20th century broadened after ''Brown'' to a strategy that emphasized &quot;[[direct action]]&quot;: boycotts, [[sit-in]]s, [[Freedom Rides]], marches or walks, and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance, standing in line, and, at times, civil disobedience.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Churches, local grassroots organizations, fraternal societies, and black-owned businesses mobilized volunteers to participate in broad-based actions. This was a more direct and potentially more rapid means of creating change than the traditional approach of mounting court challenges used by the NAACP and others.

In 1952, the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL), led by [[T. R. M. Howard]], a black surgeon, entrepreneur, and planter organized a successful boycott of gas stations in Mississippi that refused to provide restrooms for blacks. Through the RCNL, Howard led campaigns to expose brutality by the Mississippi state highway patrol and to encourage blacks to make deposits in the black-owned [[Tri-State Bank]] of [[Nashville]] which, in turn, gave loans to civil rights activists who were victims of a &quot;credit squeeze&quot; by the [[White Citizens' Councils]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beito and Beito&quot;&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, ''Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power'', Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009, pp. 81, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Claudette Colvin]] was arrested for not giving up her seat on a [[Montgomery, Alabama]] bus in March 1955, a bus boycott was considered and rejected. But when [[Rosa Parks]] was arrested in December, [[Jo Ann Robinson|Jo Ann Gibson Robinson]] of the Montgomery Women's Political Council put the bus boycott protest in motion. Late that night, she, John Cannon (chairman of the Business Department at [[Alabama State University]]) and others mimeographed and distributed thousands of leaflets calling for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robinson, Jo Ann Gibson |url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/robinson-jo-ann-gibson |website=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=December 3, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson 1986&quot;&gt;Robinson, Jo Ann &amp; Garrow, David J. (foreword by Coretta Scott King) ''The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-394-75623-1}} Knoxville, University of Tennessee Press&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual success of the boycott made its spokesman [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], a nationally known figure. It also inspired other bus boycotts, such as the successful [[Tallahassee, Florida]] boycott of 1956–57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallahassee.com/special/boycott/reader-smith.html &quot;The Tallahassee Bus Boycott—Fifty Years Later],&quot; ''The Tallahassee Democrat'', May 21, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210094329/http://www.tallahassee.com/special/boycott/reader-smith.html |date=December 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, King and [[Ralph Abernathy]], the leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association, joined with other church leaders who had led similar boycott efforts, such as [[C.&amp;nbsp;K. Steele]] of Tallahassee and [[T.&amp;nbsp;J. Jemison]] of Baton Rouge, and other activists such as [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], [[Ella Baker]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Stanley Levison]], to form the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The SCLC, with its headquarters in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], did not attempt to create a network of chapters as the NAACP did. It offered training and leadership assistance for local efforts to fight segregation. The headquarters organization raised funds, mostly from Northern sources, to support such campaigns. It made nonviolence both its central tenet and its primary method of confronting racism.

In 1959, [[Septima Clarke]], Bernice Robinson, and [[Esau Jenkins]], with the help of [[Myles Horton]]'s [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in [[Tennessee]], began the first Citizenship Schools in [[South Carolina]]'s [[Sea Islands]]. They taught literacy to enable blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success and tripled the number of black voters on [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]]. SCLC took over the program and duplicated its results elsewhere.

When the students did not budge, the NAACP joined their battle against school segregation.

The lawyers from the NAACP had to gather plausible evidence in order to win the case of ''Brown vs. Board of Education''. Their method of addressing the issue of school segregation was to enumerate several arguments. One pertained to having exposure to interracial contact in a school environment. It was argued that interracial contact would, in turn, help prepare children to live with the pressures that society exerts in regards to race and thereby afford them a better chance of living in a democracy. In addition, another argument emphasized how &quot;'education' comprehends the entire process of developing and training the mental, physical and moral powers and capabilities of human beings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Risa L. Goluboff, ''The Lost Promise of Civil Rights'', Harvard University Press, MA: Cambridge, 2007, pp. 249–251&lt;/ref&gt;

Risa Goluboff wrote that the NAACP's intention was to show the Courts that African American children were the victims of school segregation and their futures were at risk. The Court ruled that both ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), which had established the &quot;separate but equal&quot; standard in general, and ''[[Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education]]'' (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional.

The federal government filed a [[friend of the court brief]] in the case urging the justices to consider the effect that segregation had on America's image in the [[Cold War]]. Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] was quoted in the brief stating that ''&quot;The United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of discrimination in this country.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;amphilsoc.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/480405.pdf Antonly Lester, &quot;Brown v.

The following year, in the case known as ''Brown II'', the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis54.htm#1954bvbe ''Brown v Board of Education'' Decision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605222536/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis54.htm#1954bvbe |date=June 5, 2008 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brown v.

[[File:Integration.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|School integration, Barnard School, [[Washington, D.C.]], 1955]]

On May 18, 1954, [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], became the first city in the South to publicly announce that it would abide by the Supreme Court's ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling. &quot;It is unthinkable,' remarked School Board Superintendent Benjamin Smith, 'that we will try to [override] the laws of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deseg&quot; /&gt; This positive reception for Brown, together with the appointment of African American David Jones to the school board in 1953, convinced numerous white and black citizens that Greensboro was heading in a progressive direction. Integration in Greensboro occurred rather peacefully compared to the process in Southern states such as Alabama, [[Arkansas]], and Virginia where &quot;[[massive resistance]]&quot; was practiced by top officials and throughout the states. In Virginia, some counties closed their public schools rather than integrate, and many white [[Christianity|Christian]] private schools were founded to accommodate students who used to go to public schools. Even in Greensboro, much local resistance to desegregation continued, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;deseg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/schooldeseginteg.aspx |title=Civil Rights Greensboro |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Northern cities also had [[Racial segregation#United States of America|de facto segregation]] policies, which resulted in a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In [[Harlem (Manhattan)|Harlem]], New York, for example, neither a single new school was built since the turn of the century, nor did a single nursery school exist&amp;nbsp;– even as the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] was causing overcrowding. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. ''Brown'' helped stimulate activism among [[New York City]] parents like [[Mae Mallory]] who, with the support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and state on ''Brown''{{'s}} principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first [[freedom schools]] of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of [[white flight]], however.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AkPnRoKK-XYC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=Power, Protest, and the Public Schools: Jewish and African American Struggles in New York City |first=Melissa F. |last=Weiner |date=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hisofblackamfall2014.voices.wooster.edu/files/2014/08/Adina_Back_Exposing_the_Whole_Segregation_Myth3.pdf Adina Back &quot;Exposing the Whole Segregation Myth: The Harlem Nine and New York City Schools&quot; in ''Freedom north: Black freedom struggles outside the South, 1940–1980'', Jeanne Theoharis, Komozi Woodard, eds.(Palgrave Macmillan, 2003) pp. 65–91]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmett Till]], a 14-year old African American from Chicago, visited his relatives in [[Money, Mississippi]], for the summer. He allegedly had an interaction with a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in a small grocery store that violated the norms of Mississippi culture, and Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W.

=== Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, 1955–1956 ===
{{Main|Rosa Parks|Montgomery bus boycott}}

[[File:Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by Deputy Sheriff D.H. Lackey after being arrested for refusing to give up her seat for a white passenger on a segregated municipal bus in Montgomery, Alabama.jpg|thumb|[[Rosa Parks]] being fingerprinted after being arrested for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white person]]

On December 1, 1955, nine months after a 15-year-old high school student, [[Claudette Colvin]], refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was arrested, [[Rosa Parks]] did the same thing. Parks soon became the symbol of the resulting Montgomery bus boycott and received national publicity. She was later hailed as the &quot;mother of the civil rights movement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mills Thornton III, &quot;Challenge and Response in the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955–1956.&quot; ''Alabama Review'' 67.1 (2014): 40-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks was secretary of the Montgomery NAACP chapter and had recently returned from a meeting at the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee where nonviolence as a strategy was taught by [[Myles Horton]] and others. After Parks' arrest, African Americans gathered and organized the Montgomery bus boycott to demand a bus system in which passengers would be treated equally.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chafe |first1=William Henry |title=The Unfinished Journey: America since World War II |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-515049-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/unfinishedjourne0000chaf|url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was led by Jo Ann Robinson, a member of the Women's Political Council who had been waiting for the opportunity to boycott the bus system. Following Rosa Parks’ arrest, Jo Ann Robinson mimeographed 52,500 leaflets calling for a boycott. They were distributed around the city and helped gather the attention of civil rights leaders. After the city rejected many of their suggested reforms, the NAACP, led by [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]], pushed for full desegregation of public buses. With the support of most of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans, the boycott lasted for 381 days, until the local ordinance segregating African Americans and whites on public buses was repealed. Ninety percent of African Americans in Montgomery partook in the boycotts, which reduced bus revenue significantly, as they comprised the majority of the riders. In November 1956, the United States Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling in the case of ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' and ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated, ending the boycott.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Local leaders established the Montgomery Improvement Association to focus their efforts. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was elected President of this organization. The lengthy protest attracted national attention for him and the city. His eloquent appeals to Christian brotherhood and American idealism created a positive impression on people both inside and outside the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson 1986&quot; /&gt;

=== Little Rock Crisis, 1957 ===
{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}
A crisis erupted in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], when [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Orval Faubus]] called out the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] on September 4 to prevent entry to the [[Little Rock Nine|nine African-American students]] who had sued for the right to attend an integrated school, [[Little Rock Central High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd The Little Rock Nine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504182855/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm#1957lrsd |date=May 4, 2017 }}&amp;nbsp;– Civil Rights Movement Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of [[Daisy Bates (civil rights activist)|Daisy Bates]], the nine students had been chosen to attend Central High because of their excellent grades.

On the first day of school, 15-year-old [[Elizabeth Eckford]] was the only one of the nine students who showed up because she did not receive the phone call about the danger of going to school. A photo was taken of Eckford being harassed by white protesters outside the school, and the police had to take her away in a patrol car for her protection. Afterwards, the nine students had to carpool to school and be escorted by military personnel in [[jeep]]s.

Faubus was not a proclaimed segregationist. The Arkansas Democratic Party, which then controlled politics in the state, put significant pressure on Faubus after he had indicated he would investigate bringing Arkansas into compliance with the ''Brown'' decision. Faubus then took his stand against integration and against the Federal court ruling. Faubus' resistance received the attention of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was determined to enforce the orders of the Federal courts. Critics had charged he was lukewarm, at best, on the goal of desegregation of public schools. But, Eisenhower federalized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in Arkansas and ordered them to return to their barracks. Eisenhower deployed elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Little Rock to protect the students.

The students attended high school under harsh conditions. They had to pass through a gauntlet of spitting, jeering whites to arrive at school on their first day, and to put up with harassment from other students for the rest of the year. Although federal troops escorted the students between classes, the students were teased and even attacked by white students when the soldiers were not around. One of the Little Rock Nine, [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], was suspended for spilling a bowl of chili on the head of a white student who was harassing her in the school lunch line. Later, she was expelled for verbally abusing a white female student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html Minnijean Brown Trickey, America.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128093710/http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2007/August/20070824131706berehellek0.2049982.html |date=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only [[Ernest Green]] of the Little Rock Nine graduated from Central High School. After the 1957–58 school year was over, Little Rock closed its public school system completely rather than continue to integrate. Other school systems across the South followed suit.

=== The method of nonviolence and nonviolence training ===
During the time period considered to be the &quot;African-American civil rights&quot; era, the predominant use of protest was nonviolent, or peaceful.&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik |title=Gandhi's Truth: On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence |date=1969 |publisher=Norton |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-393-31034-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/gandhistruth00erik_0/page/415 415] |url=https://archive.org/details/gandhistruth00erik_0/page/415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as pacifism, the method of nonviolence is considered to be an attempt to impact society positively. Although acts of racial discrimination have occurred historically throughout the United States, perhaps the most violent regions have been in the former Confederate states. During the 1950s and 1960s, the nonviolent protesting of the civil rights movement caused definite tension, which gained national attention.

In order to prepare for protests physically and psychologically, demonstrators received training in nonviolence. According to former civil rights activist Bruce Hartford, there are two main branches of nonviolence training. There is the philosophical method, which involves understanding the method of nonviolence and why it is considered useful, and there is the tactical method, which ultimately teaches demonstrators &quot;how to be a protestor{{mdash}}how to sit-in, how to picket, how to defend yourself against attack, giving training on how to remain cool when people are screaming racist insults into your face and pouring stuff on you and hitting you&quot; (Civil Rights Movement Archive). The philosophical method of nonviolence, in the American civil rights movement, was largely inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s &quot;non-cooperation&quot; with the British colonists in India, which was intended to gain attention so that the public would either &quot;intervene in advance,&quot; or &quot;provide public pressure in support of the action to be taken&quot; (Erikson, 415). As Hartford explains it, philosophical nonviolence training aims to &quot;shape the individual person's attitude and mental response to crises and violence&quot; (Civil Rights Movement Archive). Hartford and activists like him, who trained in tactical nonviolence, considered it necessary in order to ensure physical safety, instill discipline, teach demonstrators how to demonstrate, and form mutual confidence among demonstrators (Civil Rights Movement Archive).&lt;ref name=Erikson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Movement |url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv3.htm |website=Civil Rights Movement Archive|access-date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many, the concept of nonviolent protest was a way of life, a culture. However, not everyone agreed with this notion. James Forman, former [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] (and later Black Panther) member, and nonviolence trainer, was among those who did not. In his autobiography, ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries'', Forman revealed his perspective on the method of nonviolence as &quot;strictly a tactic, not a way of life without limitations.&quot; Similarly, [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], who was also an active member of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], felt that the method of nonviolence was practical. When interviewed by author Robert Penn Warren, Moses said &quot;There's no question that he ([[Martin Luther King Jr.]]) had a great deal of influence with the masses. But I don't think it's in the direction of love. It's in a practical direction . . .&quot; (Who Speaks for the Negro? Warren).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruce Hartford (full interview) |url=https://vimeo.com/17532881 |via=Vimeo |access-date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forman |first1=James |title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries |url=https://archive.org/details/makingofblackrev00form |url-access=registration |date=1972 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-940880-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2020 study in the ''American Political Science Review'', nonviolent civil rights protests boosted vote shares for the Democratic party in presidential elections in nearby counties, but violent protests substantially boosted white support for Republicans in counties near to the violent protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasow|first=Omar|date=2020|title=Agenda Seeding: How 1960s Black Protests Moved Elites, Public Opinion and Voting|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/agenda-seeding-how-1960s-black-protests-moved-elites-public-opinion-and-voting/136610C8C040C3D92F041BB2EFC3034C|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=114|issue=3|pages=638–659|doi=10.1017/S000305542000009X|issn=0003-0554|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert F. Williams and the debate on nonviolence, 1959–1964 ===

The Jim Crow system employed &quot;terror as a means of social control,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, ''Poor People's Movements: How They Succeed, How They Fail'' (Random House, 1977), 182&lt;/ref&gt; with the most organized manifestations being the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and their collaborators in local police departments. This violence played a key role in blocking the progress of the civil rights movement in the late 1950s. Some black organizations in the South began practicing armed self-defense. The first to do so openly was the Monroe, North Carolina, chapter of the [[NAACP]] led by [[Robert F. Williams]]. Williams had rebuilt the chapter after its membership was terrorized out of public life by the Klan. He did so by encouraging a new, more working-class membership to arm itself thoroughly and defend against attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-1534.html Timothy B. Tyson, ''Radio Free Dixie: Robert F. Williams and the Roots of &quot;Black Power&quot;'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 79–80]&lt;/ref&gt; When Klan nightriders attacked the home of NAACP member Albert Perry in October 1957, Williams' militia exchanged gunfire with the stunned Klansmen, who quickly retreated. The following day, the city council held an emergency session and passed an ordinance banning KKK motorcades.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Radio Free Dixie, 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Lumbee Indians in North Carolina would have a similarly successful armed stand-off with the Klan (known as the [[Battle of Hayes Pond]]) which resulted in KKK leader James W. &quot;Catfish&quot; Cole being convicted of incitement to riot.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Graham, [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-postwar/6068 &quot;January 1958: The Lumbees face the Klan&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206071001/http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-postwar/6068 |date=February 6, 2018 }}, This Month in North Carolina History&lt;/ref&gt;

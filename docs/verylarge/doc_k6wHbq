Hawn began taking ballet and tap dance lessons at the age of three and danced in the corps de ballet of the [[Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo]] production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' in 1955. She made her stage debut in 1964, playing Juliet in a Virginia Shakespeare Festival production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Romeo and Juliet' Performance a Hit,&quot; ''Daily Press'' (Newport News, Virginia), August 18, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, she ran and taught in a ballet school, having dropped out of [[American University]] where she was majoring in drama. In 1964, Hawn made her professional dancing debut in a production of ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' at the Texas Pavilion of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. She began working as a professional dancer a year later and appeared as a [[go-go dancer]] in [[New York City]]&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; and at the Peppermint Box in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name= interviewmag2017/&gt;

Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at [[Melodyland Theatre]], a [[theater in the round]] across from [[Disneyland]], joining the chorus of ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' and ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'' during the June 14 to September 1966 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1966-succeed-business-melodyland-1918685788|title=1966 HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS Melodyland RICKY NELSON 120 Photo Negatives &amp;#124; #1918685788|website=Worthpoint|accessdate=June 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ?

Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was also as a dumb blonde, as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]''. On the show, she often broke out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her bikini-attired and painted body, Hawn was seen as an 1960s [[It girl|&quot;It&quot; girl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Heyman | first=Marshall | date=May 17, 2017 | title=Solid Goldie: Goldie Hawn Is Back and Better Than Ever | magazine=[[Harper's Bazaar]] | url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a9661481/goldie-hawn-interview/ | access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ''Laugh-In'' persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'', and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]''. Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film ''[[The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band]]'', in which she was billed as &quot;Goldie Jeanne&quot;, but in her first major film role, in ''Cactus Flower'' (1969), she won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] as [[Walter Matthau]]'s suicidal fiancée. The same year, she appeared in ''The Spring Thing'', a television special hosted by [[Bobbie Gentry]] and [[Noel Harrison]]. Other guests were [[Meredith MacRae]], Irwin C. Watson, [[Rod McKuen]], [[Shirley Bassey]], and [[Harpers Bizarre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=david+winters+variety&amp;pg=PA343|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012, 2d ed.|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|date=2013-06-06|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476612409|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with ''[[There's a Girl in My Soup]]'' (1970), ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' (1971), and ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas ''[[The Girl from Petrovka]]'' and ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', and ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: ''Pure Goldie'' in 1971 and ''The Goldie Hawn Special'' in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of ''[[The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox]]'', while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.

On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend [[George Burns]], teen matinee idol [[Shaun Cassidy]], television star [[John Ritter]] (during his days on ''[[Three's Company]]''), and even the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' (with [[Chevy Chase]]), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot.

Hawn's next film, [[Mario Monicelli]]'s ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1979), was a [[box office bomb]].

In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for [[Warner Brothers]], titled ''Goldie''. It was recorded with the help of [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Buck Owens]]. [[AllMusic]] gives the album a favorable review, calling it a &quot;sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg_record_review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r574832/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Goldie: Review|last=Mason|first=Stewart|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===

Hawn's popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer [[Liza Minnelli]], ''Goldie and Liza Together'' (1980), which was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'', a comedy she co-produced with her friend [[Nancy Meyers]], who co-wrote the script. Meyers recalls Hawn's reaction when she first described the idea for the story with Hawn as its lead:

{{quote|It was like watching the greatest audience I've ever seen. She laughed and then she got real emotional and her eyes would fill up with tears. She loved the image of herself in an Army uniform and she loved what the movie had to say.&lt;ref&gt;Schneck, Dale. &quot;Friendship with Goldie Hawn led to 'Private Benjamin'&quot;, ''The Morning Call'' (Allentown, PA), Nov. 5, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Private Benjamin'' also stars [[Eileen Brennan]] and [[Armand Assante]] and garnered Hawn her second [[Academy Award]] nomination, this time for Best Actress.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TPS7pbioI4|title=Private Benjamin - 1980 Trailer |date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=July 28, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawn's box office success continued with comedies like ''[[Seems Like Old Times (film)|Seems Like Old Times]]'' (1980), written by [[Neil Simon]]; ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982), written by [[Valerie Curtin]] and [[Barry Levinson]]; ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'' (1984), co-written by Nancy Meyers; ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]'' (1986)—Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two; and the [[World War II]] romantic drama ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'' (1984).

At the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of ''[[Playboy]]''{{'s}} January 1985 issue and was the subject of the [[Playboy#The Playboy Interview|Playboy Interview]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/9a/df/e19adf43dd7d22fdebfabec460d88d6f.jpg Hawn on the cover of Playboy magazine], January 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner [[Kurt Russell]], for the third time, in the comedy ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]'' (1987).

===1990s===
In 1990 she starred in the action comedy ''[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]'', a critically panned but commercially successful picture that paired Hawn with [[Mel Gibson]]. Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller ''[[Deceived]]'' (1991), the drama ''[[CrissCross]]'' and opposite [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in ''[[Housesitter (film)|Housesitter]]'', a screwball comedy with [[Steve Martin]], which was a commercial success.

Hawn was absent from the screen for four years while caring for her mother who died of cancer in 1994.&lt;ref name=actors/&gt; Hawn made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy ''[[Something to Talk About (film)|Something to Talk About]]'' starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Dennis Quaid]] and made her directorial debut in the television film ''Hope'' (1997) starring [[Christine Lahti]] and [[Jena Malone]].&lt;ref name=actors/&gt;
Hawn returned to the screen again in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', opposite [[Bette Midler]] and [[Diane Keaton]], with whom she covered the [[Lesley Gore]] hit &quot;[[You Don't Own Me]]&quot; for the film's soundtrack.

The '''XY sex-determination system''' is a [[sex-determination system]] used to classify many [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s, some insects (''[[Drosophila]]''), some snakes, some fish ([[guppy|guppies]]), and some plants (''[[Ginkgo]]'' tree). In this system, the [[sex]] of an individual is determined by a pair of [[Allosome|sex chromosomes]]. Females typically have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the [[homogametic sex]]. Males typically have two different kinds of sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the [[heterogametic sex]].

In humans, the presence of the Y chromosome is typically responsible for triggering male development; in the absence of the Y chromosome, the fetus will undergo female development. More specifically, it is the ''[[SRY]]'' gene located on the Y chromosome that is of importance to male differentiation. Variations to the sex gene [[karyotype]] could include rare disorders such as [[XX males]] (often due to translocation of the SRY gene to the X chromosome) or [[XY gonadal dysgenesis]] in people who are externally female (due to mutations in the SRY gene). In addition, other rare genetic variations such as [[Turner syndrome|Turners]] (XO) and [[Klinefelter syndrome|Klinefelters]] (XXY) are seen as well. In most species in XY sex determination, a organism most have at least one X chromosome in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt; https://sciencing.com/occurs-zygote-one-fewer-chromosome-usual-17818.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Can a Zygote Survive Without an X Sex Chromosome?|url=https://education.seattlepi.com/can-zygote-survive-x-sex-chromosome-4599.html|access-date=2020-11-08|website=Education - Seattle PI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XY system contrasts in several ways with the [[ZW sex-determination system]] found in [[birds]], some insects, many [[reptile]]s, and various other animals, in which the heterogametic sex is female. It had been thought for several decades that in all snakes sex was determined by the ZW system, but there had been observations of unexpected effects in the genetics of species in the families [[Boidae]] and [[Pythonidae]]; for example, parthenogenic reproduction produced only females rather than males, which is the opposite of what is to be expected in the ZW system. In the early years of the 21st century such observations prompted research that demonstrated that all pythons and boas so far investigated definitely have the XY system of sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.010| pmid=28690112| title=The Discovery of XY Sex Chromosomes in a Boa and Python| year=2017| last1=Gamble| first1=Tony| last2=Castoe| first2=Todd A.| last3=Nielsen| first3=Stuart V.| last4=Banks| first4=Jaison L.| last5=Card| first5=Daren C.| last6=Schield| first6=Drew R.| last7=Schuett| first7=Gordon W.| last8=Booth| first8=Warren| journal=Current Biology| volume=27| issue=14| pages=2148–2153.e4| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olena, Abby.

A [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] system is found in some reptiles.

== Mechanisms ==
All [[animal]]s have a set of [[DNA]] coding for [[gene]]s present on [[chromosome]]s. In humans, most mammals, and some other species, two of the [[chromosome]]s, called the [[X chromosome]] and [[Y chromosome]], code for sex. In these species, one or more [[gene]]s are present on their [[Y chromosome]] that determine maleness. In this process, an [[X chromosome]] and a [[Y chromosome]] act to determine the sex of offspring, often due to genes located on the Y chromosome that code for maleness. Offspring have two sex chromosomes: an offspring with two X chromosomes will develop female characteristics, and an offspring with an X and a Y chromosome will develop male characteristics.

===Humans===
[[File:Human male karyotpe high resolution - XY chromosome cropped.JPG|thumb|199px|Human male XY chromosomes after [[G-banding]]]]
In humans, half of [[spermatozoa]] carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.genderselectionauthority.com/blog/five-facts-about-xx-or-xy |website=www.genderselectionauthority.com |title=Five Facts about XX or XY |date=March 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006160607/https://www.genderselectionauthority.com/blog/five-facts-about-xx-or-xy |archive-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single gene (''[[SRY]]'') present on the Y chromosome acts as a signal to set the developmental pathway towards maleness. Presence of this gene starts off the process of [[virilization]]. This and other factors result in the [[sex differences in humans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|url = https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00asfa|url-access = limited|last = Fauci|first = Anthony S.|publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-07-147693-5|location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00asfa/page/n2377 2339]–2346|edition = 17th|last2 = Braunwald|first2 = Eugene|last3 = Kasper|first3 = Dennis L.|last4 = Hauser|first4 = Stephen L.|last5 = Longo|first5 = Dan L.|last6 = Jameson|first6 = J. Larry|last7 = Loscalzo|first7 = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells in females, with two X chromosomes, undergo [[X-inactivation]], in which one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. The inactivated X chromosome remains within a cell as a [[Barr body]].

Humans, as well as some other organisms, can have a rare chromosomal arrangement that is contrary to their phenotypic sex; for example, [[XX male syndrome|XX males]] or [[XY gonadal dysgenesis|XY females]] (see [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]]). Additionally, an abnormal number of sex chromosomes ([[aneuploidy]]) may be present, such as [[Turner's syndrome]], in which a single X chromosome is present, and [[Klinefelter's syndrome]], in which two X chromosomes and a Y chromosome are present, [[XYY syndrome]] and [[XXYY syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Other less common chromosomal arrangements include: [[triple X syndrome]], [[48, XXXX]], and [[49, XXXXX]]. 

===Other animals===
In most mammals, sex is determined by presence of the Y chromosome. &quot;Female&quot; is the default sex, due to the absence of the Y chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex determination and differentiation|url=http://www.bio.uu.nl/endocrinology/teaching/Sex%20Determinatie.pdf|website=Utrecht University - Department of Biology|accessdate=13 November 2014|location=Ultrecht, Netherlands|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127173815/http://www.bio.uu.nl/endocrinology/teaching/Sex%20Determinatie.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, [[Alfred Jost]] determined that the presence of [[testosterone]] was required for [[Wolffian duct]] development in the male rabbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.1970.0052 |pmid=4399057 |jstor=2417046 |title=Hormonal Factors in the Sex Differentiation of the Mammalian Foetus &amp;#91;and Discussion&amp;#93; |year=1970 |last1=Jost |first1=A. |last2=Price |first2=D. |last3=Edwards |first3=R.

SRY is a sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in the [[theria]]ns (placental mammals and marsupials).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18581056&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wallis MC, Waters PD, Graves JA | title = Sex determination in mammals - Before and after the evolution of SRY | journal = Cell.

Not all male-specific genes are located on the Y chromosome. [[Platypus]], a [[monotreme]], use five pairs of different XY chromosomes with six groups of male-linked genes, [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|AMH]] being the master switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortez |first1=Diego |last2=Marin |first2=Ray |last3=Toledo-Flores |first3=Deborah |last4=Froidevaux |first4=Laure |last5=Liechti |first5=Angélica |last6=Waters |first6=Paul D. |last7=Grützner |first7=Frank |last8=Kaessmann |first8=Henrik |title=Origins and functional evolution of Y chromosomes across mammals |journal=Nature |date=24 April 2014 |volume=508 |issue=7497 |pages=488–493 |doi=10.1038/nature13151|pmid=24759410 |bibcode=2014Natur.508..488C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species (including most ''[[Drosophila]]'' species) use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness: one X chromosome gives putative maleness, but the presence of Y chromosome genes is required for normal male development.

===Other systems===
{{Main|Sex determination system}}

Birds and many insects have a similar system of sex determination (''[[ZW sex-determination system]]''), in which it is the females that are heterogametic (ZW), while males are homogametic (ZZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Craig A.|last2=Sinclair|first2=Andrew H.|date=February 2004|title=Sex determination: insights from the chicken|journal=BioEssays |volume=26|issue=2|pages=120–132|doi=10.1002/bies.10400|issn=0265-9247|pmid=14745830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many insects of the order [[Hymenoptera]] instead have a [[haplo-diploid sex-determination system|''haplo-diploid'' system]], where the males are [[haploid]] (having just one chromosome of each type) while the females are [[diploid]] (with chromosomes appearing in pairs). Some other insects have the ''[[X0 sex-determination system]]'', where just one chromosome type appears in pairs for the female but alone in the males, while all other chromosomes appear in pairs in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genetics.knoji.com/5-types-of-sex-determination-in-animals/|title=5 Types of Sex Determination in Animals|website=genetics.knoji.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205101323/https://genetics.knoji.com/5-types-of-sex-determination-in-animals/|archivedate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for the ''Rediscovering Biology'' website,&lt;ref&gt;Rediscovering Biology, Unit 11 - Biology of Sex and Gender, Expert interview transcripts, [http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/units/gender/experts/vilain.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823063603/http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/units/gender/experts/vilain.html |date=2010-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene:
{{Quote|text=For a long time we thought that SRY would activate a cascade of male genes. It turns out that the sex determination pathway is probably more complicated and SRY may in fact inhibit some anti-male genes.

The idea is instead of having a simplistic mechanism by which you have pro-male genes going all the way to make a male, in fact there is a solid balance between pro-male genes and anti-male genes and if there is a little too much of anti-male genes, there may be a female born and if there is a little too much of pro-male genes then there will be a male born.

We [are] entering this new era in molecular biology of sex determination where it's a more subtle dosage of genes, some pro-males, some pro-females, some anti-males, some anti-females that all interplay with each other rather than a simple linear pathway of genes going one after the other, which makes it very fascinating but very complicated to study.}}

In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene is responsible with triggering the development of non-differentiated [[gonads]] into testes, rather than [[ovaries]]. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see [[sex reversal]]). In these cases, the [[SOX9]] gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process,&lt;ref&gt;

==== Implications ====
Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences. Scientists have been studying different sex determination systems in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] and animal models to attempt an understanding of how the genetics of sexual differentiation can influence biological processes like reproduction, ageing&lt;ref&gt;

===Maternal===
In humans and many other species of animals, the [[father]] determines the [[sex]] of the child. In the XY sex-determination system, the female-provided [[ovum]] contributes an X [[chromosome]] and the male-provided [[sperm]] contributes either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome, resulting in female (XX) or male (XY) offspring, respectively.

Hormone levels in the male parent affect the sex ratio of sperm in humans.&lt;ref name=Krackow/&gt; Maternal influences also impact which sperm are more likely to achieve [[fertilisation|conception]].

Human ova, like those of other mammals, are covered with a thick translucent layer called the [[zona pellucida]], which the sperm must penetrate to fertilize the egg. Once viewed simply as an impediment to [[fertilization]], recent research indicates the zona pellucida may instead function as a sophisticated biological security system that chemically controls the entry of the sperm into the egg and protects the fertilized egg from additional sperm.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Wymelenberg, Science and Babies, National Academy Press, 1990, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research indicates that human ova may produce a chemical which appears to attract sperm and influence their swimming motion. However, not all sperm are positively impacted; some appear to remain uninfluenced and some actually move away from the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Jones and Kristin H. Lopez, Human Reproductive Biology, Third Edition, Elsevier, 2006, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal influences may also be possible that affect sex determination in such a way as to produce [[fraternal twins]] equally weighted between one male and one female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~brucehjohnson/bgtwins.pdf Familial recurrence of gender-balanced twins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002160341/http://home.comcast.net/~brucehjohnson/bgtwins.pdf |date=October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time at which insemination occurs during the [[estrus cycle]] has been found to affect the sex ratio of the offspring of humans, cattle, hamsters, and other mammals.&lt;ref name=Krackow&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krackow, S. |year=1995 |title=Potential mechanisms for sex ratio adjustment in mammals and birds |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=225–241 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1995.tb01066.x|pmid=7605846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormonal and pH conditions within the female reproductive tract vary with time, and this affects the sex ratio of the sperm that reach the egg.&lt;ref name=Krackow/&gt;

Sex-specific mortality of embryos also occurs.&lt;ref name=Krackow/&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient ideas on sex determination ===
[[Aristotle]] believed incorrectly that the sex of an infant is determined by how much heat a man's sperm had during insemination. He wrote:
{{Quote|text=...the semen of the male differs from the corresponding secretion of the female in that it contains a principle within itself of such a kind as to set up movements also in the embryo and to concoct thoroughly the ultimate nourishment, whereas the secretion of the female contains material alone. If, then, the male element prevails it draws the female element into itself, but if it is prevailed over it changes into the opposite or is destroyed.}}
Aristotle claimed in error that the male principle was the driver behind sex determination,&lt;ref&gt;''De Generatione Animalium'', 766B 15‑17.&lt;/ref&gt; such that if the male principle was insufficiently expressed during reproduction, the [[fetus]] would develop as a female.

=== 20th century genetics ===
[[Nettie Stevens]] and [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]] are credited with independently discovering, in 1905, the chromosomal XY sex-determination system, i.e. the fact that males have XY sex [[chromosomes]] and females have XX sex chromosomes.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brush|first=Stephen G.|date=June 1978|title=Nettie M. Stevens and the Discovery of Sex Determination by Chromosomes|jstor=230427|journal=Isis|volume=69|issue=2|pages=162–172|doi=10.1086/352001|pmid=389882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaftb.org/9/bio.html|title=Nettie Maria Stevens – DNA from the Beginning|website=www.dnaftb.org|access-date=2016-07-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001065058/http://www.dnaftb.org/9/bio.html|archivedate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John L. Heilbron (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'', Oxford University Press, 2003, &quot;genetics&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clues to the existence of a factor that determines the development of testis in mammals came from experiments carried out by [[Alfred Jost]],&lt;ref&gt;Jost A., ''Recherches sur la differenciation sexuelle de l’embryon de lapin'', Archives d'anatomie microscopique et de morphologie experimentale, 36: 271&amp;nbsp;– 315, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; who castrated embryonic rabbits in utero and noticed that they all developed as female.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 1959, C. E. Ford and his team, in the wake of Jost's experiments, discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=FORD CE, JONES KW, POLANI PE, DE ALMEIDA JC, BRIGGS JH |title=A sex-chromosome anomaly in a case of gonadal dysgenesis (Turner's syndrome)|journal=Lancet|date=Apr 4, 1959|volume=1|issue=7075|pages=711–3|pmid=13642858|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(59)91893-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Y chromosome was needed for a fetus to develop as male when they examined patients with [[Turner syndrome|Turner's syndrome]], who grew up as phenotypic females, and found them to be X0 ([[hemizygous]] for X and no Y). At the same time, Jacob &amp; Strong described a case of a patient with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (XXY),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JACOBS|first=PA|author2=STRONG, JA |title=A case of human intersexuality having a possible XXY sex-determining mechanism.|journal=Nature|date=Jan 31, 1959|volume=183|issue=4657|pages=302–3|pmid=13632697|doi=10.1038/183302a0|bibcode=1959Natur.183..302J}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implicated the presence of a Y chromosome in development of maleness.&lt;ref name=LARSENS2009 /&gt;

All these observations lead to a consensus that a dominant gene that determines testis development ([[Testis determining factor|TDF]]) must exist on the human Y chromosome.&lt;ref name=LARSENS2009 /&gt; The search for this [[Testis determining factor|testis-determining factor]] (TDF) led a team of scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sinclair | first = Andrew H.  | date=19 July 1990  | title = A gene from the human sex-determining region encodes a protein with homology to a conserved DNA-binding motif  | journal = Nature  | volume=346 | issue=6281 | pages= 240–244  | doi = 10.1038/346240a0  | pmid = 1695712|display-authors=etal| url = http://rcin.org.pl/Content/66315  | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..240S }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to discover a region of the Y chromosome that is necessary for the male sex determination, which was named [[SRY]] (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome).&lt;ref name=LARSENS2009&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary C. |last=Schoenwolf|title=Larsen's human embryology|date=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780443068119|chapter=Development of the Urogenital system|edition=4th |pages=307–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''window''' is an opening in a [[wall]], [[door]], [[roof]] or [[vehicle]] that allows the passage of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. Modern windows are usually [[glazing (window)|glazed]] or covered in some other [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] or translucent material, a [[Window sash|sash]] set in a frame&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.&lt;ref name=&quot;Window&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/window/ |title=Window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows may have a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.

Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, [[hexagonal window]]s, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding [[sash window]]s, [[casement window]]s, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or [[louver]]ed windows, [[clerestory]] windows, [[lancet window]]s, skylights, roof windows, [[roof lantern]]s, [[bay window]]s, [[oriel window]]s, thermal, or [[Diocletian window|Diocletian]], windows, picture windows, [[Rose window]]s, emergency exit windows, [[stained glass]] windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple paned windows, and [[witch window]]s.

The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], in [[Alexandria]] ca. 100 AD. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In [[England]], glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were fully perfected.

==Etymology==
The English language-word ''window'' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr{{snd}} wind' and 'auga{{snd}} eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open &quot;window&quot;, not strictly a synonym for ''gluggi'', the Icelandic word for window&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=71376|title=Hvaðan kemur orðið gluggi? Af hverju notum við ekki vindauga samanber window?|work=Vísindavefurinn|access-date=2018-09-17|language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the word ''vindöga'' remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut, and in the Danish language 'vindue' and Norwegian [[Bokmål]] 'vindu', the direct link to 'eye' is lost, just as for 'window'. The Danish (but not the Bokmål) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.

''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eagþyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'fönster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[façade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.

==History==

[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]]
In the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], for example [[fengite]], or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window
|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.

Over the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-1-4053-4545-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

==Types==
===Cross===
A [[cross-window]] is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a [[Latin cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Curl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyebrow===
The term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed===
A fixed window is a window that cannot be opened,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVTjAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Fixed+window+is+window+that+cannot+open&amp;pg=PA83|title=Kitchen &amp; Bath Residential Construction and Systems|last=Association)|first=NKBA (National Kitchen and Bath|date=2013-10-29|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118711040|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in [[church architecture]] are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.

===Single-hung sash===
A single-hung sash window is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

===Double-hung sash===
A [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.

Double-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached—so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.

===Foldup===
[[File:Foldup window.gif|thumb|Foldup window (inward swinging), cross-section side view]]
A foldup has two equal sashes similar to a standard double hung, but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or for egress.

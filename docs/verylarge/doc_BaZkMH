A '''linear motor''' is an [[electric motor]] that has had its [[stator]] and [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] &quot;unrolled&quot; thus instead of producing a [[torque]] ([[rotation]]) it produces a linear [[force]] along its length. However, linear motors are not necessarily straight. Characteristically, a linear motor's active section has ends, whereas more conventional motors are arranged as a continuous loop.

A typical mode of operation is as a [[Lorentz force|Lorentz]]-type actuator, in which the applied force is [[linear equation|linearly proportional]] to the [[electric current|current]] and the [[magnetic field]] &lt;math&gt;(\vec F = I \vec L \times \vec B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Linear motors are by far most commonly found in high accuracy engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/ProductShowcase/LinearMotors.aspx |title=Linear Motors |publisher=engineering.com |date= |accessdate=2020-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications. It is a thriving field of applied research with dedicated scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archiveweb.epfl.ch/ldia2019.epfl.ch |title=International Symposium on Linear Drives for Industry Applications |publisher=epfl.ch |date= |accessdate=2020-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering text books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781439842218 |title=Linear Synchronous Motors: Transportation and Automation Systems, Second Edition |publisher=isbnsearch.org |date= |accessdate=2020-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many designs have been put forward for linear motors, falling into two major categories, low-acceleration and high-acceleration linear motors. Low-acceleration linear motors are suitable for [[maglev train]]s and other ground-based transportation applications. High-acceleration linear motors are normally rather short, and are designed to accelerate an object to a very high speed, for example see the [[coilgun]].

High-acceleration linear motors are typically used in studies of [[hypervelocity]] collisions, as [[weapon]]s, or as [[mass driver]]s for [[spacecraft propulsion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They are usually of the AC [[linear induction motor]] (LIM) design with an active [[three-phase]] winding on one side of the air-gap and a passive conductor plate on the other side. However, the direct current [[homopolar motor|homopolar]] linear motor [[railgun]] is another high acceleration linear motor design. The low-acceleration, high speed and high power motors are usually of the '''linear synchronous motor''' (LSM) design, with an active winding on one side of the air-gap and an array of alternate-pole magnets on the other side. These magnets can be [[permanent magnet]]s or [[electromagnet]]s. The [[Shanghai Transrapid]] motor is an LSM.

==Types==

===Synchronous===
In this design the rate of movement of the magnetic field is controlled, usually electronically, to track the motion of the rotor. For cost reasons synchronous linear motors rarely use [[Commutator (electric)|commutators]], so the rotor often contains permanent magnets, or [[Magnetic core#Soft iron|soft iron]]. Examples include [[coilgun]]s and the motors used on some [[maglev]] systems, as well as many other linear motors.

===Induction===
[[File:Three phase linear induction motor.gif|thumb|A typical 3 phase linear induction motor. An aluminium plate on top often forms the secondary &quot;rotor&quot;.]]
{{main|Linear induction motor}}
In this design, the force is produced by a moving linear [[magnetic field]] acting on conductors in the field. Any conductor, be it a loop, a coil or simply a piece of plate metal, that is placed in this field will have [[eddy current]]s [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] in it thus creating an opposing magnetic field, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].&lt;ref name=Liasi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghaseminejad Liasi|first1=Sahand|title=What are linear motors?|date=15 May 2015|pages=1â€“50|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.16250.18887|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322040360_What_are_linear_motors|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two opposing fields will repel each other, thus creating motion as the magnetic field sweeps through the metal.

===Homopolar===
[[File:Railgun-1.svg|thumb|Railgun schematic]]
{{main|Railgun}}
In this design a large current is passed through a metal sabot across sliding contacts that are fed from two rails. The magnetic field this generates causes the metal to be projected along the rails.

===Piezo electric===

==History==
[[File:Running on the Xunfeng Gang To Hengsha section of Guangzhou Metro Line 6.jpg|thumb|This [[Line 6, Guangzhou Metro|Line 6]] [[Guangzhou Metro]] train manufactured by [[CRRC]] [[Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock|Sifang]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] propels itself using an aluminium induction strip placed between the rails.]]

===Low acceleration===
The history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s, to the work of [[Charles Wheatstone]] at [[King's College London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |title=Charles Wheatstone - College History - King's College London |publisher=Kcl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021162729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |archivedate=2009-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Wheatstone's model was too inefficient to be practical. A feasible linear induction motor is described in the {{US patent|782312}} (1905 - inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main), for driving trains or lifts. The German engineer [[Hermann Kemper]] built a working model in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000224/http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, Dr. [[Eric Laithwaite]] of [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]], later Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering at [[Imperial College]] in [[London]] developed the first full-size working model. In a single sided version the magnetic repulsion forces the conductor away from the stator, levitating it, and carrying it along in the direction of the moving magnetic field. He called the later versions of it [[magnetic river]].

[[File:Linear Motor of Toei ÅŒedo Line.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A linear motor for trains running [[Toei ÅŒedo Line]]]]
Because of these properties, linear motors are often used in [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] propulsion, as in the Japanese [[Linimo]] [[magnetic levitation train]] line near [[Nagoya]]. However, linear motors have been used independently of magnetic levitation, as in the [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit]] systems worldwide and a number of modern Japanese subways, including [[Tokyo]]'s [[Toei ÅŒedo Line]].

Similar technology is also used in some [[roller coaster]]s with modifications but, at present, is still impractical on street running [[tram]]s, although this, in theory, could be done by burying it in a slotted conduit.

Outside of public transportation, vertical linear motors have been proposed as lifting mechanisms in deep [[mining|mine]]s, and the use of linear motors is growing in [[motion control]] applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of [[low floor]] trams such as the [[Alstom Citadis]] and the [[Socimi Eurotram]]. Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct ''X''-''Y'' motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated [[Technical drawing|drafting]], and cable forming. Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motor), or LSM (linear synchronous motor). Linear DC motors are not used due to higher cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.

===High acceleration===
High-acceleration linear motors have been suggested for a number of uses.
They have been considered for use as [[weapon]]s, since current [[armour-piercing]] ammunition tends to consist of small rounds with very high [[kinetic energy]], for which just such motors are suitable. Many amusement park [[launched roller coaster]]s now use linear induction motors to propel the train at a high speed, as an alternative to using a [[lift hill]]. The United States Navy is also using linear induction motors in the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] that will replace traditional [[steam catapult]]s on future aircraft carriers. They have also been suggested for use in [[spacecraft propulsion]]. In this context they are usually called [[mass driver]]s. The simplest way to use mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion would be to build a large mass driver that can accelerate cargo up to [[escape velocity]], though [[reusable launch system|RLV]] launch assist like [[StarTram]] to [[low earth orbit]] has also been investigated.

High-acceleration linear motors are difficult to design for a number of reasons. They require large amounts of [[energy]] in very short periods of time. One rocket launcher design&lt;ref name=&quot;coilgun&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coilgun.info/theory/electroguns.htm|title=Magnetic Materials - Electromagnetic Guns|publisher=coilgun.info|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for 300 GJ for each launch in the space of less than a second. Normal [[electrical generator]]s are not designed for this kind of load, but short-term electrical energy storage methods can be used. [[Capacitors]] are bulky and expensive but can supply large amounts of energy quickly. [[Homopolar generator]]s can be used to convert the kinetic energy of a [[flywheel]] into electric energy very rapidly. High-acceleration linear motors also require very strong magnetic fields; in fact, the magnetic fields are often too strong to permit the use of [[superconductivity|superconductors]]. However, with careful design, this need not be a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Superconductor Science and Technology|year = 2010|title = A single-sided linear synchronous motor with a high temperature superconducting coil as the excitation system|first1 = F. |last1 = Yen|first2 = J. |last2 = Li|first3 = S.

Two different basic designs have been invented for high-acceleration linear motors: [[railgun]]s and [[coilgun]]s.

== Usage ==
Linear motors are widely used. One of the major uses of linear motors is for propelling the shuttle in [[loom]]s.

Linear motors have been used for sliding doors and various similar actuators.  Also, they have been used for baggage handing and even large-scale bulk materials transport.

Linear motors are sometimes used to create rotary motion, for example, they have been used at observatories to deal with the large radius of curvature.

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], using the {{convert|0|°C|0}} isotherm, New York City features a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel, M.

Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore temper the moderating effects of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[Indianapolis]].

From 1890 to 1973, the title of [[History of the tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]] resided continually in Manhattan (with a gap between 1894 and 1908, when the title was held by [[Philadelphia City Hall]]), with eight different buildings holding the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|date=1995-11-05|title=F.y.i.|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/05/nyregion/fyi-016047.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York World Building]] on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], was the first to take the title in 1890, standing {{convert|309|ft|m}} until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 18, 1956|title=Plaza Job Started at Brooklyn Bridge|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/18/archives/plaza-job-started-at-brooklyn-bridge.html|access-date=September 28, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Park Row Building]], with its 29 stories standing {{convert|391|ft|m|0}} high, became the world's tallest office building when it opened in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=2000-03-12|title=Streetscapes/The Park Row Building, 15 Park Row; An 1899 'Monster' That Reigned High Over the City|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/realestate/streetscapes-park-row-building-15-park-row-1899-monster-that-reigned-high-over.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 41-story [[Singer Building]], constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the [[eponym]]ous sewing machine manufacturer, stood {{convert|612|ft|m|0}} high until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=2005-01-02|title=Once the Tallest Building, but Since 1967 a Ghost|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/realestate/once-the-tallest-building-but-since-1967-a-ghost.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]], standing {{convert|700|ft|m}} at the foot of [[Madison Avenue]], wrested the title in 1909, with a tower reminiscent of [[St Mark's Campanile]] in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=1996-05-26|title=Streetscapes/Metropolitan Life at 1 Madison Avenue;For a Brief Moment, the Tallest Building in the World|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/realestate/streetscapes-metropolitan-life-1-madison-avenue-for-brief-moment-tallest.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Woolworth Building]], and its distinctive [[Gothic architecture]], took the title in 1913, topping off at {{convert|792|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=2000-11-02|title=Condos to Top Vaunted Tower Of Woolworth|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/garden/condos-to-top-vaunted-tower-of-woolworth.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures such as the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]] of 1915, which rises vertically forty stories from the sidewalk, prompted the passage of the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]], requiring new buildings to contain [[setback (architecture)|setback]]s withdrawing progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve a view of the sky at street level.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt20160726&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=July 25, 2016|title=Zoning Arrived 100 Years Ago.

Manhattan also has the [[United States counties by per capita income|highest per capita income of any county in the United States]].

In 2010, Manhattan's daytime population was swelling to 3.94&amp;nbsp;million, with [[commuter]]s adding a net 1.48&amp;nbsp;million people to the population, along with visitors, tourists, and commuting students.

Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon [[Washington Square Park]] to commemorate the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of [[women's liberation]], reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ The Triangle Factory Fire] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67c8qVy2v?url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/ |date=May 12, 2012 }}, [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]].

The [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s established the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Manhattan's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American [[pop art]] movement, which gave birth to such giants as [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist [[Andy Warhol]] and clubs like [[Serendipity 3]] and [[Studio 54]], where he socialized.

{{main|Cloud physics}}
[[File:Cumulus humilis clouds in Ukraine.jpg|thumb|[[Cumulus clouds]] in May]]

Terrestrial clouds can be found throughout most of the homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. Within these layers of the [[atmosphere]], air can become saturated as a result of being cooled to its [[dew point]] or by having moisture added from an adjacent source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bart van den Hurk |author2=Eleanor Blyth |year=2008 |url=http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf |title=Global maps of Local Land-Atmosphere coupling |publisher=KNMI |access-date=2 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074154/http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, saturation occurs when the dew point is raised to the ambient air temperature.

===Adiabatic cooling===
[[Adiabatic lapse rate#Dry adiabatic lapse rate|Adiabatic cooling]] occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – convective, cyclonic/frontal, or orographic – cause a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling.&lt;ref name=&quot;adiabatic process&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Nave, R. |year=2013 |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/adiab.html |title=Adiabatic Process |publisher=gsu.edu |access-date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on [[cloud condensation nuclei]] such as [[salt]] or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] of the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;humidity, saturation, and stability&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Elementary Meteorology Online |year=2013 |url=http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/~wintelsw/MET1010LOL/chapter06/ |title=Humidity, Saturation, and Stability |publisher=vsc.edu |access-date=18 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502055741/http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/~wintelsw/MET1010LOL/chapter06/ |archive-date=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cloud drops&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Horstmeyer, Steve | title = Cloud Drops, Rain Drops | year = 2008 | url = http://www.shorstmeyer.com/wxfaqs/float/float.html | access-date = 19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One agent is the convective upward motion of air caused by daytime solar heating at surface level.&lt;ref name=&quot;humidity, saturation, and stability&quot;/&gt; Airmass instability allows for the formation of cumuliform clouds that can produce showers if the air is sufficiently moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2011JD016457| title = Linear relation between convective cloud drop number concentration and depth for rain initiation| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 117| issue = D2| pages = n/a| year = 2012| last1 = Freud | first1 = E.| last2 = Rosenfeld | first2 = D.|bibcode = 2012JGRD..117.2207F }}&lt;/ref&gt; On moderately rare occasions, convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the stratosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tropopause penetrations&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Long, Michael J.|author2=Hanks, Howard H.|author3=Beebe, Robert G.|title=TROPOPAUSE PENETRATIONS BY CUMULONIMBUS CLOUDS|date=June 1965|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0621573|access-date=9 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235551/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0621573|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dreamy Twilight.jpg|thumb|Windy evening [[twilight]] enhanced by the Sun's angle, can visually mimic a [[tornado]] resulting from orographic lift]]

===Non-adiabatic cooling===
Along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent, three major nonadiabatic mechanisms exist for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point. Conductive, radiational, and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of [[fog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fog formation&quot;&gt;[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Glossary of Meteorology |year=2009 |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search |title=Radiational cooling |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |access-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512161339/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search |archive-date=12 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fovell, Robert |year=2004 |url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf |title=Approaches to saturation |publisher=[[UCLA|University of California in Los Angeles]] |access-date=7 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074155/http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical forms===
[[File:Cirrus-fibratus.jpg|thumb|[[Cirrus fibratus]] clouds in March]]
Clouds in the troposphere assume five physical forms based on structure and process of formation. These forms are commonly used for the purpose of satellite analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;LANDSAT identification&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19760014556| title=The identification of cloud types in LANDSAT MSS images |author1=E.C.

Grant | year=1976 | access-date=22 August 2012 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are given below in approximate ascending order of instability or [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pilotfriend.com/av_weather/meteo/clouds.htm |title= Meteorology | editor = Pilotfriend | year = 2016 | access-date = 19 March 2016 | publisher = Pilotfriend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stratiform====
''Nonconvective'' stratiform clouds appear in ''stable'' airmass conditions and, in general, have flat, sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratiform&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor= NASA|title= Stratiform or Stratus Clouds |year=2015 |url= http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Aero2000/studweb/glossary/stratcld.html|access-date= 23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera [[cirrostratus cloud|cirrostratus]] (high-level), [[altostratus cloud|altostratus]] (mid-level), [[stratus cloud|stratus]] (low-level), and [[nimbostratus cloud|nimbostratus]] (multi-level).&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; Fog is commonly considered a surface-based cloud layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;MT&quot;/&gt; The fog may form at surface level in clear air or it may be the result of a very low stratus cloud subsiding to ground or sea level. Conversely, low stratiform clouds result when [[advection fog]] is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions.
[[File:Cloudy Skies in Orange County.jpg|thumb|Stratocumulus over Orange County.]]
====Cirriform====
Cirriform clouds in the troposphere are of the genus [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] and have the appearance of detached or semimerged filaments. They form at high tropospheric altitudes in air that is mostly stable with little or no convective activity, although denser patches may occasionally show buildups caused by ''limited'' high-level [[convection]] where the air is partly ''unstable''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cirrus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Cirrus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-genera-cirrus.html|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds resembling cirrus can be found above the troposphere but are classified separately using common names.

====Stratocumuliform====
Clouds of this structure have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics in the form of rolls, ripples, or elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;identification guide&quot;/&gt; They generally form as a result of ''limited convection'' in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Multi-regime convection&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00712679|bibcode=1995BoLMe..73..373L| title = A theoretical model of multi-regime convection in a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer| journal = Boundary-Layer Meteorology| volume = 73| issue = 4| pages = 373–409| year = 1995| last1 = Laufersweiler | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Shirer | first2 = H. N. |s2cid=123031505}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased airmass instability may cause the cloud layers to develop tops in the form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups.&lt;ref name=&quot;castellanus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Altocumulus Castellanus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/species-altocumulus-castellanus-ac-cas.html|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stratocumuliform group is divided into [[cirrocumulus cloud|cirrocumulus]] (high-level), [[altocumulus cloud|altocumulus]] (mid-level), and [[stratocumulus cloud|stratocumulus]] (low-level).&lt;ref name=&quot;identification guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Cloud Identification Guide, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/cloud-identification-guide.html |access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cumuliform====
Cumuliform clouds generally appear in isolated heaps or tufts.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wcumulus.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|work=Weather|title=Cumulus clouds|access-date=16 October 2012|date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stommel91&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1175/1520-0469(1947)004&lt;0091:EOAIAC&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = Entrainment of Air into a Cumulus Cloud| journal = Journal of Meteorology| volume = 4| issue = 3| pages = 91–94| year = 1947| last1 = Stommel | first1 = H. |bibcode = 1947JAtS....4...91S | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the product of localized but generally ''free-convective'' lift where no inversion layers are in the troposphere to limit vertical growth. In general, small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability. Larger cumuliform types are a sign of greater atmospheric instability and convective activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mossop632-634&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4164.632| title = Ice Crystal Concentration in Cumulus Clouds: Influence of the Drop Spectrum| journal = Science| volume = 186| issue = 4164| pages = 632–634| year = 1974| last1 = Mossop | first1 = S.

====Cumulonimbiform====
[[File:Cumulonimbus calvus cloud over the Gulf of Mexico in Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Cumulonimbus cloud over the Gulf of Mexico in Galveston, Texas]]
{{See also|Atmospheric convection}}

The largest free-convective clouds comprise the genus [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]], which have towering vertical extent. They occur in highly unstable air&lt;ref name=&quot;humidity, saturation, and stability&quot;/&gt; and often have fuzzy outlines at the upper parts of the clouds that sometimes include anvil tops.&lt;ref name=&quot;identification guide&quot;/&gt; These clouds are the product of very strong convection that can penetrate the lower stratosphere.

===Levels and genera===
{{See also|Weather map|Station model}}

Tropospheric clouds form in any of three levels (formerly called [[wikt:étage|''étages'']]) based on altitude range above the Earth's surface. The grouping of clouds into levels is commonly done for the purposes of [[cloud atlas]]es, [[surface weather observation]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; and [[weather map]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWTOREAD&quot;&gt;JetStream (2008). [http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm How to read weather maps.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101062001/http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/synoptic/wxmaps.htm |date=1 January 2015 }} [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The base-height range for each level varies depending on the latitudinal [[geographical zone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; Each altitude level comprises two or three genus-types differentiated mainly by physical form.&lt;ref name=&quot;appearance&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Appearance of Clouds, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/appearance-of-clouds.html |access-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;identification guide&quot;/&gt;

The standard levels and genus-types are summarised below in approximate descending order of the altitude at which each is normally based.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmo-cloud classifications&quot;/&gt; Multi-level clouds with significant vertical extent are separately listed and summarized in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorology&quot;/&gt;

====High-level====

High clouds form at altitudes of {{convert|10000|to|25000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} in the [[polar region]]s, {{convert|16500|to|40000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} in the [[Temperateness|temperate regions]], and {{convert|20000|to|60000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} in the [[tropics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; All cirriform clouds are classified as high, thus constitute a single genus ''cirrus'' (Ci). Stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix ''cirro-'', yielding the respective genus names ''cirrocumulus'' (Cc) and ''cirrostratus'' (Cs). When limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations, distinguishing between individual forms or genus types becomes impossible, and they are then collectively identified as ''high-type'' (or informally as ''cirrus-type'', though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloud type identification&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=Colorado State University Dept. of Atmospheric Science | url =http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/wmovl/VRL/Texts/SATELLITE_METEOROLOGY/CHAPTER-2.PDF| title= Cloud type identification by satellites |year=2015 | access-date=30 December 2015 | publisher = [[Colorado State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-level====
[[File:Sunrise (Abbottabad).jpg|thumb|Sunrise scene giving a shine to an altocumulus stratiformis perlucidus cloud (see also 'species and varieties')]]
Nonvertical clouds in the middle level are prefixed by ''alto-'', yielding the genus names ''altocumulus'' (Ac) for stratocumuliform types and ''altostratus'' (As) for stratiform types. These clouds can form as low as {{convert|6500|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} above surface at any latitude, but may be based as high as {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} near the poles, {{convert|23000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} at midlatitudes, and {{convert|25000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} in the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; As with high clouds, the main genus types are easily identified by the human eye, but distinguishing between them using satellite photography is not possible. Without the support of human observations, these clouds are usually collectively identified as ''middle-type'' on satellite images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloud type identification&quot;/&gt;

* Genus altocumulus (Ac):

:This is a midlevel cloud layer of limited convection that is usually appears in the form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranged in groups, lines, or waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;altocumulus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Altocumulus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-genera-altocumulus.html|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altocumulus may occasionally resemble cirrocumulus, but is usually thicker and composed of a mix of water droplets and ice crystals, so the bases show at least some light-grey shading.&lt;ref name=&quot;ac-compared&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Ac Compared With Cc, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/ac-compared-with-cc.html|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altocumulus can produce virga, very light precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid-level-clouds&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=Met Office |title=Mid Level Clouds – Altocumulus |year=2017 |url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/clouds/mid-level-clouds/altocumulus |access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Genus altostratus (As):

[[File:As 1.jpg|thumb|Altostratus translucidus near top of photo merging into altostratus opacus near bottom]]

:Altostratus is a midlevel opaque or translucent nonconvective veil of grey/blue-grey cloud that often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas. Altostratus is usually composed of water droplets, but may be mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;altostratus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Altostratus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-genera-altostratus.html|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Low-level====
Low clouds are found from near the surface up to {{convert|6500|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Definitions&quot;/&gt; Genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one that refers to a characteristic other than altitude. Clouds that form in the low level of the troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in the middle and high levels, so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using satellite photography alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloud type identification&quot;/&gt;

====Multi-level or moderate vertical====
[[File:Ns1.jpg|thumb|left|Deep multi-level nimbostratus cloud covering the sky with a scattered layer of low stratus fractus pannus (see also 'species' and 'supplementary features' sections)]]
[[File:Clouds over Africa.jpg|thumb|[[Cumulus humilis]] and [[cumulus mediocris]] with stratocumulus stratiformis perlucidus in the foreground (see also 'species and varieties')]]
These clouds have low- to mid-level bases that form anywhere from near the surface to about {{convert|8000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} and tops that can extend into the mid-altitude range and sometimes higher in the case of nimbostratus.
* Genus nimbostratus (Ns); ''multi-level'':

* Genus cumulus (Cu); species mediocris – ''moderate vertical extent'':
:These cumuliform clouds of free convection have clear-cut, medium-grey, flat bases and white, domed tops in the form of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;cumulus&quot;/&gt; They usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity, when the clouds bases can rise into the middle-altitude range.

====Towering vertical====
{{See also|Atmospheric convection}}
These very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types have cloud bases in the same low- to mid-level range as the multi-level and moderate vertical types, but the tops nearly always extend into the high levels.

* Genus cumulus (Cu); species congestus – ''great vertical extent'':
:Increasing airmass instability can cause free-convective cumulus to grow very tall to the extent that the vertical height from base to top is greater than the base-width of the cloud. The cloud base takes on a darker grey coloration and the top commonly resembles a cauliflower.

===Species===

Genus types are commonly divided into subtypes called ''species'' that indicate specific structural details which can vary according to the stability and windshear characteristics of the atmosphere at any given time and location. Despite this hierarchy, a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus, especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level. There are a few species, each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical form.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Species, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-species.html|access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species types are grouped below according to the physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated. The forms, genera, and species are listed from left to right in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteorology&quot;/&gt;

====Stable or mostly stable====
Of the non-convective stratiform group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. Cirrostratus ''nebulosus'' has a rather diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;nebulosus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Nebulosus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-species-nebulosus.html| access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrostratus ''fibratus'' is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional to or from cirrus.&lt;ref name=&quot;fibratus&quot;/&gt; Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus&lt;ref name=&quot;nebulosus&quot;/&gt; except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus [[Fractus cloud|fractus]] (see below).&lt;ref name=&quot;cloud atlas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clouds - species and varieties&quot;/&gt;

Cirriform clouds have three non-convective species that can form in ''stable'' airmass conditions. Cirrus fibratus comprise filaments that may be straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by wind shear.&lt;ref name=&quot;fibratus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Fibratus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-species-fibratus.html| access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species ''uncinus'' is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. Cirrus ''spissatus'' appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Lenticular Cloud in Wyoming 0034b.jpg|thumb|[[Lenticular cloud|Altocumulus lenticularis]] forming over mountains in Wyoming with lower layer of cumulus mediocris and higher layer of cirrus spissatus]]

Stratocumuliform genus-types (cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus) that appear in mostly stable air with limited convection have two species each. The ''stratiformis'' species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;stratiformis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Stratiformis, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-species-stratiformis.html| access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds of the ''lenticularis'' species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-[[wave cloud]]s, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. These two species can be found in the high, middle, or low levels of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.&lt;ref name=&quot;cloud atlas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clouds - species and varieties&quot;/&gt;

====Ragged====
The species ''fractus'' shows ''variable'' instability because it can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly ''stable'' stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus).&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clouds - species and varieties&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fractus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Species Fractus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-species-fractus.html|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When clouds of this species are associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, they are also classified as ''accessory clouds'' under the name ''pannus'' (see section on supplementary features).&lt;ref name=&quot;pannus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Accessory Cloud Pannus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-accessory-pannus.html|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partly unstable====
These species are subdivisions of genus types that can occur in partly unstable air with limited convection. The species ''castellanus'' appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually in the morning or afternoon. This results in the formation of embedded cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elevated convection&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stephen F. Corfidi |title=Elevated Convection and Castellanus: Ambiguities, Significance, and Questions |journal=Weather and Forecasting |author2=Sarah J.

They are sometimes seen with cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus.&lt;ref name=&quot;floccus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Species Floccus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-species-floccus.html|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newly recognized species of stratocumulus or altocumulus has been given the name ''volutus'', a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation.&lt;ref name=ICA2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|access-date=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some volutus clouds that form as a consequence of interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud. Perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the [[Morning Glory cloud|Morning Glory]], a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in [[Northern Australia]]. Associated with a powerful &quot;ripple&quot; in the atmosphere, the cloud may be &quot;surfed&quot; in [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;stg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/08/07/2045486.htm |title=Soaring the glory |author=Abbie Thomas |date=7 August 2003 |website=ABC Science |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=30 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unstable or mostly unstable====
More general airmass instability in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds. A cumulus cloud initially forms in the low level of the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species ''humilis'' that shows only slight vertical development. If the air becomes more unstable, the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species ''mediocris'', then strongly convective ''congestus'', the tallest cumulus species&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt; which is the same type that the International Civil Aviation Organization refers to as 'towering cumulus'.&lt;ref name=&quot;automated Cb and Tcu detection&quot;/&gt;

With highly unstable atmospheric conditions, large cumulus may continue to grow into even more strongly convective cumulonimbus ''calvus'' (essentially a very tall congestus cloud that produces thunder), then ultimately into the species ''capillatus'' when supercooled water droplets at the top of the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clouds - species and varieties&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Boyd, Sylke |title=Clouds – Species and Varieties |year=2008 |url=http://www.morris.umn.edu/~sboyd/weather/cloudsystems/Clouds_files/speciesandvarieties.htm |access-date=4 February 2012 |website=University of Minnesota |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230041442/http://www.morris.umn.edu/~sboyd/weather/cloudsystems/Clouds_files/speciesandvarieties.htm |archive-date=30 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varieties===
Genus and species types are further subdivided into ''varieties'' whose names can appear after the species name to provide a fuller description of a cloud. Some cloud varieties are not restricted to a specific altitude level or form, and can therefore be common to more than one genus or species.&lt;ref name=&quot;varieties&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Varieties, International Cloud Atlas|year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/principles-of-cloud-classification-varieties.html|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opacity-based====

All cloud varieties fall into one of two main groups. One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties ''translucidus'' (thin translucent), ''perlucidus'' (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and ''opacus'' (thick opaque). These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, or in the case of cirrus spissatus, always opaque.&lt;ref name=&quot;varieties&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerographer2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Aerographer/Meteorology |year=2012 |url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14269/css/14269_20.htm |title=Cloud Variety |access-date=2 July 2012 |website=meteorologytraining.tpub.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221005913/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14269/css/14269_20.htm |archive-date=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pattern-based====

A second group describes the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible only from a significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species with which they are otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. ''Intortus'' and ''vertebratus'' varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. The variety ''radiatus'' is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cumulus Humilis-Skynews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Cumulus-skynews |title=Clouds: Their curious natures |year=2013 |url=http://cumulus-skynews.tumblr.com/post/49212742113/5a-cumulus-humilis-radiatus-the-latin-term |access-date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pretor-Pinney20&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pretor-Pinney|first=Gavin|author-link=Gavin Pretor-Pinney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ix4qy7FihDcC|title=The Cloudspotter's Guide: The Science, History, and Culture of Clouds|isbn=978-1-101-20331-6|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Group|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the genus altostratus.&lt;ref name=&quot;radiatus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Variety Radiatus, International Cloud Atlas |year=2017 |url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/clouds-varieties-radiatus.html|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hemichordata''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɛ|m|i|k|ɔr|ˈ|d|eɪ|t|ə}} is a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of marine [[deuterostome]] [[animal]]s, generally considered the sister group of the [[echinoderm]]s. They appear in the Lower or Middle [[Cambrian]] and include two main classes: [[Enteropneusta]] (acorn worms), and [[Pterobranchia]]. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is known only from the larva of a single species, ''[[Planctosphaera pelagica]]''. The extinct class [[Graptolithina]] is closely related to the pterobranchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=Atsuko|author2=Rickards RB |author3=Holland PWH |title=The origins of graptolites and other pterobranchs: a journey from 'Polyzoa'|journal=Lethaia|date=December 2008|volume=41|pages=303–316|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00123.x|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy ==
The body plan of hemichordates is characterized by a muscular organization. The [[Anatomical terms of location|anteroposterior axis]] is divided into three parts: the anterior prosome, the intermediate mesosome, and the posterior metasome.

The body of acorn worms is worm-shaped and divided into an anterior proboscis, an intermediate collar, and a posterior trunk. The proboscis is a muscular and ciliated organ used in locomotion and in the collection and transport of food particles. The mouth is located between the proboscis and the collar. The trunk is the longest part of the animal. It contains the pharynx, which is perforated with gill slits (or pharyngeal slits), the esophagus, a long intestine, and a terminal anus. It also contains the gonads. A post-anal tail is present in juvenile member of the acorn worm family [[Harrimaniidae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 5049775 | pmid=27701429 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0162564 | volume=11 | issue=10 | title=The Global Diversity of Hemichordata | journal=PLOS ONE | page=e0162564 | last1 = Tassia | first1 = MG | last2 = Cannon | first2 = JT | last3 = Konikoff | first3 = CE | last4 = Shenkar | first4 = N | last5 = Halanych | first5 = KM | last6 = [[Billie J.

The prosome of pterobranchs is specialized into a muscular and ciliated cephalic shield used in locomotion and in secreting the coenecium. The mesosome extends into one pair (in the genus ''Rhabdopleura'') or several pairs (in the genus ''Cephalodiscus'') of tentaculated arms used in filter feeding. The metasome, or trunk, contains a looped digestive tract, gonads, and extends into a contractile stalk that connects individuals to the other members of the colony, produced by asexual budding. In the genus ''Cephalodiscus'', asexually produced individuals stay attached to the contractile stalk of the parent individual until completing their development. In the genus ''Rhabdopleura'', zooids are permanently connected to the rest of the colony via a common stolon system.

They have a [[diverticulum]] of the foregut called a [[stomochord]], previously thought to be related to the chordate [[notochord]], but this is most likely the result of [[convergent evolution]] rather than a [[homology (biology)|homology]]. A hollow [[neural tube]] exists among some species (at least in early life), probably a primitive trait that they share with the common ancestor of [[chordate|chordata]] and the rest of the deuterostomes{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nomakstainsky|first=M|display-authors=etal|journal=Current Biology|date=11 August 2009|volume=19|pages=1264–9|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.063|pmid=19559615|title=Centralization of the deuterostome nervous system predates chordates|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circulatory system

Circulatory system is open type. Heart of Hemichordates is dorsal.

== Development ==
Together with the [[Echinoderms]], the hemichordates form the [[Ambulacraria]], which are the closest extant phylogenetic relatives of [[chordates]] among the invertebrates. Thus these marine worms are of great interest for the study of the origins of chordate development. There are several species of hemichordates, with a moderate diversity of embryological development among these species. Hemichordates are classically known to develop in two ways, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15575607 | volume = 74 | title = Hemichordate embryos: procurement, culture, and basic methods | year = 2004 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780124802780/page/171 171–94] | journal = Methods Cell Biol. | last1 = Lowe | first1 = CJ | last2 = Tagawa | first2 = K | last3 = Humphreys | first3 = T | last4 = Kirschner | first4 = M | last5 = Gerhart | first5 = J | doi = 10.1016/S0091-679X(04)74008-X | series = Methods in Cell Biology | isbn = 9780124802780 | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780124802780/page/171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemichordates are a phylum composed of two classes, the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs, both being forms of marine worm.

The enteropneusts have two developmental strategies: direct and indirect development. The indirect developmental strategy includes an extended pelagic plankotrophic tornaria larval stage, which means that this hemichordate exists in a larval stage that feeds on plankton before turning into an adult worm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tagawa | first1 = K. | last2 = Nishino | first2 = A | last3 = Humphreys | first3 = T | last4 = Satoh | first4 = N. | date = 1 January 1998 | title = The Spawning and Early Development of the Hawaiian Acorn worm (Hemichordate), Ptycodhera flava | url = | journal = Zoological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 85–91 | doi = 10.2108/zsj.15.85 | pmid = 18429670 | hdl = 2433/57230 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pterobranch genus most extensively studied is ''Rhabdopleura'' from Plymouth, England and from Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stebbing|first=ARD|title=Aspects of the reproduction and life cycle of Rhabdopleura compacta (Hemichordata)|journal=Marine Biology|year=1970|volume=5|pages=205–212|doi=10.1007/BF00346908|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dilly|first=PN|title=The larva of Rhabdopleura compacta (Hemichordata)|journal=Marine Biology|date=January 1973|volume=18|pages=69–86|doi=10.1007/BF00347923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lester|first=SM|title=Settlement and metamorphosis of Rhabdopleura normani (Hemichordata: Pterobranchia)|journal=Acta Zoologica|date=June 1988|volume=69|pages=111–120|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6395.1988.tb00907.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lester|first=SM|title=Ultrastructure of adult gonads and development and structure of the larva of Rhabdopleura normani|journal=Acta Zoologica|year=1986|volume=69|pages=95–109|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6395.1988.tb00906.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following details the development of two popularly studied species of the hemichordata phylum ''Saccoglossus kowalevskii'' and ''Ptychodera flava''. ''Saccoglossus kowalevskii'' is a direct developer and ''Ptychodera flava'' is an indirect developer. Most of what has been detailed in Hemichordate development has come from hemichordates that develop directly.

[[File:Hemichordate development.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Schematic of embryonic cleavage and development in ''P.flava'' and ''S.kowalevskii'']]

=== ''Ptychodera flava'' ===
''P. flava’s'' early cleavage pattern is similar to that of ''S. kowalevskii''. The first and second cleavages from the single cell zygote of ''P. flava'' are equal cleavages, are [[orthogonal]] to each other and both include the animal and vegetal poles of the embryo. The third cleavage is equal and equatorial so that the embryo has four [[blastomere]]s both in the vegetal and the animal pole. The fourth division occurs mainly in blastomeres in the animal pole, which divide transversally as well as equally to make eight blastomeres. The four vegetal blastomeres divide equatorially but unequally and they give rise to four big macromeres and four smaller micromeres. Once this fourth division has occurred, the embryo has reached a 16 cell stage. ''P. flava'' has a 16 cell embryo with four vegetal micromeres, eight animal [[mesomere]]s and 4 larger macromeres. Further divisions occur until ''P. flava'' finishes the [[blastula]] stage and goes on to [[gastrulation]]. The animal mesomeres of ''P. flava'' go on to give rise to the larva’s [[ectoderm]], animal [[blastomere]]s also appear to give rise to these structures though the exact contribution varies from embryo to embryo. The macromeres give rise to the posterior larval ectoderm and the vegetal micromeres give rise to the internal endomesodermal tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11806633 | volume=3 | issue=6 | title=Deuterostome evolution: early development in the enteropneust hemichordate, ''Ptychodera flava'' | date=November–December 2001| pages=375–90 | doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.01051.x | journal=Evolution &amp; Development | last1 = Henry | first1 = JQ | last2 = Tagawa | first2 = K | last3 = Martindale | first3 = MQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done on the potential of the embryo at different stages have shown that at both the two and four cell stage of development ''P. flava'' blastomeres can go on to give rise to a tornaria larvae, so fates of these embryonic cells don’t seem to be established till after this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colwin | first1 = A | last2 = Colwin | first2 = L | year = 1950 | title = The developmental capacities of separated early blastomeres of an enteropneust, ''Saccoglossus kowalevskii'' | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume = 155 | issue = 2| pages = 263–296| doi = 10.1002/jez.1401150204  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Saccoglossus kowalevskii'' ===
Eggs of ''S. kowalevskii'' are oval in shape and become spherical in shape after fertilization. The first cleavage occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole and usually is equal though very often can also be unequal. The second cleavage to reach the embryos four cell stage also occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole in an approximately equal fashion though like the first cleavage it’s possible to have an unequal division. The eight cell stage cleavage is latitudinal; so that each cell from the four cell stage goes on to make two cells. The fourth division occurs first in the cells of the animal pole, which end up making eight blastomeres (mesomeres) that are not radially symmetric, then the four vegetal pole blastomeres divide to make a level of four large blastomeres (macromeres) and four very small blastomeres (micromeres). The fifth cleavage occurs first in the animal cells and then in the vegetal cells to give a 32 cell blastomere. The sixth cleavage occurs in a similar order and completes a 64 cell stage, finally the seventh cleavage marks the end of the cleavage stage with a blastula with 128 blastomeres. This structure goes on to go through gastrulation movements which will determine the body plan of the resulting gill slit larva, this larva will ultimately give rise to the marine acorn worm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colwin | first1 = A | last2 = Colwin | first2 = L | year = 1951 | title = Relationships between the egg and larva of Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Enteropneusta): axes and planes; general prospective significance of the early blastomeres | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 111–138 | doi=10.1002/jez.1401170107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arthur L. |last1=Colwin |first2=Laura Hunter |last2=Colwin |date=May 1953 |title=The normal embryology of saccoglossus kowalevskii (enteropneusta) | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 92 |issue=3 | pages = 401–453 | doi = 10.1002/jmor.1050920302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic control of dorsal-ventral hemichordate patterning ===
Much of the genetic work done on hemichordates has been done to make comparison with chordates, so many of the genetic markers identified in this group are also found in chordates or are homologous to chordates in some way. Studies of this nature have been done particularly on ''S. kowalevskii'', and like chordates ''S. kowalevskii'' has dorsalizing bmp-like factors such as ''bmp 2/4'', which is homologous to Drosophila’s decapentaplegic dpp. The expression of ''bmp2/4'' begins at the onset of gastrulation on the ectodermal side of the embryo, and as gastrulation progresses its expression is narrowed down to the dorsal midline but is not expressed in the post anal tail. The bmp antagonist chordin is also expressed in the [[endoderm]] of gastrulating ''S. kowalevskii''. Besides these well known dorsalizing factors, further molecules known to be involved in dorsal ventral patterning are also present in ''S. kowalevskii'', such as a netrin that groups with netrin gene class 1 and 2.&lt;ref name=Lowe2006 /&gt; Netrin is important in patterning of the neural system in chordates, as well as is the molecule Shh, but ''S. kowalevskii'' was only found to have one hh gene and it appears to be expressed in a region that is uncommon to where it is usually expressed in developing chordates along the ventral midline.

'''Acanthocephala''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|k|æ|n|θ|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|ə|l|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|acanthocephalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ἄκανθος|ἄκανθος]]}}, ''{{lang|el|akanthos}}'', thorn + {{lang|el|[[:wikt:κεφαλή|κεφαλή]]}}, ''{{lang|el|kephale}}'', head) is a [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[parasitic]] [[worm]]s known as '''acanthocephalans''', '''thorny-headed worms''', or '''spiny-headed worms''', characterized by the presence of an [[wiktionary:evert|eversible]] [[proboscis]], armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] wall of its host. Acanthocephalans have [[Parasitic life cycles|complex life cycles]], involving at least two hosts, which may include [[invertebrate]]s, fish, [[amphibian]]s, birds, and [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;de BuronGolvan2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Buron|first1=I.|last2=Golvan|first2=Y.

The Acanthocephala were thought to be a discrete [[phylum]]. Recent [[genome]] analysis has shown that they are descended from, and should be considered as, highly modified [[rotifer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;shimek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2006-01/rs/index.php | author = Shimek, Ronald | accessdate =July 27, 2008 | title = Nano-Animals, Part I: Rotifers | publisher = Reefkeeping.com |date=January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unified taxon is known as [[Syndermata]].

== History ==
The earliest recognisable description of Acanthocephala – a worm with a proboscis armed with hooks – was made by Italian author [[Francesco Redi]] (1684).&lt;ref name=&quot;crompton&quot;&gt;Crompton 1985, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, [[Joseph Koelreuter]] proposed the name Acanthocephala.&lt;ref name=&quot;crompton&quot; /&gt; [[Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller]] independently called them ''Echinorhynchus'' in 1776.&lt;ref name=&quot;crompton&quot; /&gt; [[Karl Rudolphi]] in 1809 formally named them Acanthocephala.

==Phylogeny==
{{See also|List of bilateral animal orders}}
Acanthocephalans are highly adapted to a parasitic mode of life, and have lost many organs and structures through evolutionary processes. This makes determining relationships with other higher taxa through morphological comparison problematic. [[Phylogeny|Phylogenetic]] analysis of the 18S [[ribosome|ribosomal]] gene has revealed that the Acanthocephala are most closely related to the [[rotifer]]s. They are possibly closer to the two rotifer classes [[Bdelloidea]] and [[Monogononta]] than to the other class, [[Seisonidea]], producing the names and relationships shown in the [[cladogram]] below.{{clade|{{clade

A study of the gene order in the mitochondria suggests that Seisonidea and Acanthocephala are sister clades and that the Bdelloidea are the sister clade to this group.&lt;ref name=Sielaff2015&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sielaff | first1 = M | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = H | last3 = Struck | first3 = TH | last4 = Rosenkranz | first4 = D | last5 = Mark Welch | first5 = DB | last6 = Hankeln | first6 = T | last7 = Herlyn | first7 = H | date = March 2016 | title = Phylogeny of Syndermata (syn.

Currently the phylum is divided into four classes – [[Palaeacanthocephala]], [[Archiacanthocephala]], [[Polyacanthocephala]] and [[Eoacanthocephala]]. The monophyletic Archiacanthocephala are the sister taxon of a clade comprising Eoacanthocephala and the monophyletic Palaeacanthocephala.&lt;ref name=Weber2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = M | last2 = Wey-Fabrizius Alexandra | first2 = R | last3 = Podsiadlowski | first3 = L | last4 = Witek | first4 = A | last5 = Schill Ralph | first5 = O | last6 = Sugár | first6 = L | last7 = Herlyn | first7 = H | last8 = Hankeln | first8 = T | date = January 2013 | title = Phylogenetic analysis of endoparasitic Acanthocephala based on mitochondrial genomes suggests secondary loss of sense organs | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 66| issue =1 | pages = 182–189| doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.017 | pmid = 23044398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphological characteristics==
[[File:Corynosoma drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of Acanthocephalan morphology|Some key features of acanthocephalan morphology]]

There are several morphological characteristics that distinguish acanthocephalans from other phyla of parasitic worms.

===Digestion===
Acanthocephalans lack a mouth or [[alimentary canal]]. This is a feature they share with the [[cestoda]] (tapeworms), although the two groups are not closely related. Adult stages live in the [[intestine]]s of their host and uptake nutrients which have been [[digestion|digested]] by the host, directly, through their body surface.

===Proboscis===
[[File:Parasite140083-fig5 Figs 31-36 Cathayacanthus spinitruncatus.tif|thumb|Scanning electron microscopy of proboscis of ''[[Cathayacanthus spinitruncatus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amin | first1 = O. A | last2 = Heckmann | first2 = R. A | last3 = Ha | first3 = N. V. | year = 2014 | title = Acanthocephalans from fishes and amphibians in Vietnam, with descriptions of five new species | url = | journal = Parasite | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 53 | doi = 10.1051/parasite/2014052 |pmid=25331738 | pmc=4204126}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most notable feature of the acanthocephala is the presence of an [[anterior]], protrudible [[proboscis]] that is usually covered with spiny hooks (hence the common name: thorny or spiny headed worm). The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host. The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually, longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis. The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.

Like the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a ''septum'' or ''proboscis sheath''. Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are [[muscle]]-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other.  Their contraction causes the proboscis to be invaginated into its cavity. The whole proboscis apparatus can also be, at least partially, withdrawn into the body cavity, and this is effected by two retractor muscles which run from the posterior aspect of the septum to the body wall.

Some of the acanthocephalans (perforating acanthocephalans) can insert their proboscis in the intestine of the host and open the way to the abdominal cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parasites World&quot; &gt;{{cite web |title=Acanthocephalans drilling Acipenser stellatus intestine |publisher=Parasites World |url=http://parasites-world.com/acanthocephalns-drilling-acipenser-stellatus-intestine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
The size of these animals varies greatly, some are measured to be a few millimetres in length to ''[[Gigantorhynchus gigas]]'', which measures from {{convert|10|to|65|cm|in}}.

===Skin===
The body surface of the acanthocephala is peculiar.  Externally, the skin has a thin [[tegument (helminth)|tegument]] covering  the [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], which consists of a [[syncytium]] with no [[cell wall]]s. The syncytium is traversed by a series of branching [[tubule]]s containing fluid and is controlled by a few wandering, [[amoeboid]] [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. Inside the syncytium is an irregular layer of circular muscle fibres, and within this again some rather scattered longitudinal fibres; there is no [[endothelium]]. In their micro-structure the muscular fibres resemble those of [[nematode]]s.

Except for the absence of the longitudinal fibres the skin of the proboscis resembles that of the body, but the fluid-containing tubules of the proboscis are shut off from those of the body. The canals of the proboscis open into a circular vessel which runs round its base. From the circular canal two sac-like projections called the ''lemnisci'' run into the cavity of the body, alongside the proboscis cavity. Each consists of a prolongation of the syncytial material of the proboscis skin, penetrated by canals and sheathed with a muscular coat. They seem to act as reservoirs into which the fluid which is used to keep the proboscis &quot;erect&quot; can withdraw when it is retracted, and from which the fluid can be driven out when it is wished to expand the proboscis.

===Nervous system===
The central ganglion of the nervous system lies behind the proboscis sheath or septum. It innervates the proboscis and projects two stout trunks posteriorly which supply the body.  Each of these trunks is surrounded by muscles, and this nerve-muscle complex is called a ''retinaculum''. In the male at least there is also a [[genital]] [[ganglion]]. Some scattered [[wiktionary:Papilla|papillae]] may possibly be sense-organs.

===Reproduction===
The Acanthocephala are [[dioecious]] (an individual organism is either male or female). There is a structure called the ''genital ligament'' which runs from the posterior end of the proboscis sheath to the posterior end of the body. In the male, two [[testes]] lie on either side of this. Each opens in a [[vas deferens]] which bears three [[diverticula]] or ''vesiculae seminales''. The male also possesses three pairs of cement glands, found behind the testes, which pour their secretions through a duct into the vasa deferentia. These unite and end in a [[penis]] which opens posteriorly.

In the female, the [[ovaries]] are found, like the testes, as rounded bodies along the ligament. From the ovaries, masses of [[ovum|ova]] dehisce into the body cavity, floating in its fluids for [[fertilize|fertilization]] by male's sperm. After fertilization, each egg contains a developing [[embryo]]. (These embryos hatch into first stage [[larva]].) The fertilized eggs are brought into the [[uterus]] by actions of the ''uterine bell'', a funnel like opening continuous with the uterus. At the junction of the bell and the uterus there is a second, smaller opening situated [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsally]]. The bell &quot;swallows&quot; the matured eggs and passes them on into the uterus. (Immature embryos are passed back into the body cavity through the dorsal opening.) From the uterus, mature eggs leave the female's body via her [[oviduct]], pass into the host's alimentary canal and are expelled from the host's body within [[feces]].

=== Other features ===
A curious feature shared by both larva and adult is the large size of many of the cells, e.g. the nerve cells and cells forming the uterine bell. [[Polyploid]]y is common, with up to 343n having been recorded in some species. The acanthocephalans lack an excretory system, although some species have been shown to possess [[flame cell]]s (protonephridia).

==&quot;Body snatching&quot;==
Thorny-headed worms begin their life cycle inside invertebrates that reside in marine or freshwater systems. ''[[Gammarus lacustris]]'', a small crustacean that inhabits ponds and rivers, is one invertebrate that the thorny-headed worm may occupy. This crustacean is preyed on by ducks and hides by avoiding light and staying away from the surface. However, when infected by a thorny-headed worm it becomes attracted toward light and swims to the surface. ''Gammarus lacustris'' will even go so far as to find a rock or a plant on the surface, clamp its mouth down, and latch on, making it easy prey for the duck.  The duck is the definitive host for the acanthocephalan parasite. In order to be transmitted to the duck, the parasite's intermediate host (the gammarid) must be eaten by the duck. This modification of gammarid behavior by the acanthocephalan is thought to increase the rate of transmission of the parasite to its next host by increasing the susceptibility of the gammarid to predation.

==Criticism and historiography==

Contemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare.  The most significant is the ''[[Ukiyo-e Ruikō]]'' (&quot;''Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e''&quot;), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies.  [[Ōta Nanpo]] compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790.  The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations;{{sfn|Takeuchi|2004|pp=118, 120}} over 120 variants of the ''Ukiyo-e Ruikō'' are known.{{sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=190}}

Before World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e's founding to Moronobu.  Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th-century Yamato-e paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre's originator, and is especially favoured in Japan.  This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the Yamato-e scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}

[[File:Fenollosa.jpg|thumb|upright|American scholar of Japanese art [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the first to complete a comprehensive critical history of ukiyo-e.]]

The earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West.  [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886.  His ''Masters of {{not a typo|Ukioye}}'' of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th-century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige's landscapes in the 1830s.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=3–5}}  [[Laurence Binyon]], the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in ''Painting in the Far East'' in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa's, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters.  [[Arthur Davison Ficke]] built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive ''Chats on Japanese Prints'' in 1915.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=8–10}}  [[James&amp;nbsp;A. Michener]]'s ''The Floating World'' in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=12}}  For Michener and his sometime collaborator [[Richard Douglas Lane|Richard Lane]], ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=20}}  Lane's ''Masters of the Japanese Print'' of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art.  The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=13–14}}

{{Interlanguage link multi|Seiichirō Takahashi|ja|3=高橋誠一郎}}'s ''Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan'' of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict [[sumptuary law]]s that dictated what could be depicted in artworks.  The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had,{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=14–15}} and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of Yamato-e painting.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}  {{Interlanguage link multi|Tadashi Kobayashi|ja|3=小林忠}} further refined Takahashi's analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=15–16}}

Ukiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas.  Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses.  Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=13–14}}  While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=5–6}}

Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature.  Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form's greatest masters.  Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=17–18}}  Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed.  Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=19–20}}

Novelist [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e.  He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners' values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West's flaunting of the discovery.{{sfn|Yoshimoto|2003|p=65–66}}

[[File:Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white comic strip in Japanese|[[Manga]] histories often find an ancestor in the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]''.&lt;br/&gt;[[Rakuten Kitazawa]], ''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tōkyō Kenbutsu'',{{efn|''{{transl|ja|Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu}}'' {{lang|ja|田吾作と杢兵衛の東京見物}} ''Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo''}} 1902]]

Since the dawn of the 20th century historians of ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}''—Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th-century Japanese art.  Particular emphasis falls on the ''Hokusai Manga'' as a precursor, though Hokusai's book is not narrative, nor does the term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' originate with Hokusai.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=28–29}}  In English and other languages the word ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is used in the restrictive sense of &quot;Japanese comics&quot; or &quot;Japanese-style comics&quot;,{{sfn|Stewart|2014|p=30}} while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=336}} and caricature.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}

==Collection and preservation==

The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=140, 175}}  Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived.  They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}  Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=149}}  Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called ''azuma-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||東絵|azuma-e}} &quot;pictures of the Eastern capital&quot;}} (&quot;pictures of the Eastern capital&quot;) as souvenirs.  Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}

The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=140}}  Little concrete is known about production and consumption habits.  Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed.  Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=7–8}}

Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size,{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=216}} supply and demand,{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=31}} and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=32}}  How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|pp=216–217}}  In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 ''{{transl|ja|[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]}}''{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=151–153}} to 100 ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' for deluxe editions.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=217}}  Jun'ichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 20s and 30s of ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' were likely common for standard prints.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=43}}  As a loose comparison, a bowl of [[soba]] noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 ''mon''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1a2=Ōkubo|1y=1994|1p=217|2a1=Bell|2y=2004|2p=174}}

[[File:Ichiyōsai Yoshitaki pre-fade post-fade.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour print illustration of a Japanese woman crouching.  The image combines two photos of the same image.  The right side of the photo is faded.|Ukiyo-e prints are sensitive to light.  The left half shows this print in 1989, the right shows the same print after being on display until 2001.&lt;br/&gt;[[Utagawa Yoshitaki]], 19th century]]

The dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light. &quot;It has been recommended that Ukiyo-e prints in the best condition or near pristine condition should be the most protected and should be displayed at 50 lux for exceptionally short periods of time - if at all. Many Ukiyo-e, although sensitive, could be displayed at 50 lux for 10 weeks in any one year in any five-year period. On some special occasions the level can be increased to 200 lux. This should not happen for more than a total of twenty-five hours per year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Webber 2005, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with [[acid]]ic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or [[Alkalinity|alkaline]].  Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a [[relative humidity]] of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2001}}

The paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity.  Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity.  In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain [[Paulownia tomentosa|paulownia]] boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=61}}  In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution.  Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=75}}  Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.{{sfn|Toishi|1979|p=25}}

Because ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings.  There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints.  Prints may have stains, [[foxing]], wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched.  Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions.  When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=180, 183–184}}  Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002a}}  As of 2016, the record price for an ukiyo-e print sold at auction was {{€|link=yes}}{{val|745000}} for Utamaro's ''[[Fukaku Shinobu Koi]]'' ({{circa|1793–94}}).{{sfn|AFP–Jiji staff|2016}}

Ukiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions.  Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2005}}  Takamizawa Enji (1870–1927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged.  These refreshed prints he resold as original printings.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=36}}  Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who brought {{val|1500}} Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002b}}

Ukiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=313}}  Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of [[Woodblock printing in Japan#Print sizes|the standard sizes]], most commonly the {{convert|34.5|x|22.5|cm|in|adj=on}} ''aiban'', the {{convert|22.5|x|19|cm|in|adj=on}} ''chūban'', and the {{convert|38|x|23|cm|in|adj=on}} ''ōban''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}—precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=40}}

Many of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}}  Examples entered the collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] in the first half of the 19th century.  The [[British Museum]] began a collection in 1860{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=38}} that by the late 20th century numbered {{val|70000}} items.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=13–14}}  The largest, surpassing {{val|100000}} items, resides in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}} begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=39}}  The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by [[Kōjirō Matsukata]] in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War&amp;nbsp;I and later donated it to the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].{{sfn|Checkland|2004|p=107}}  The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the {{val|100000}} pieces in the [[Japan Ukiyo-e Museum]] in the [[Matsumoto, Nagano|city of Matsumoto]].{{sfn|Garson|2001|p=14}}

{{improve|reason=Quotes:
* &quot;in [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia universalis]]'' (1544)&quot; (title with small u)
* &quot;Cosmographia Universalis, 1544&quot; (title with capital U)
Thus: The titles are contradicting, which is correct?&lt;br /&gt;
According to [[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)#Editions]], there's only one, a German, edition of 1544, and its title page reads: &quot;Cosmographia: Beschreibũg aller Lender důrch Sebastianum Munsterum [Nom.: Sebastianus Munsterus] in welcher begriffen, aller völcker, Herschafften, Stetten und namhafftiger flecken, herkom̃en: Sitten, gebreüch, ordnung, glauben, secten, und hantierung, durch die gantze welt, und fürnemlich Teütscher nation. Was auch besunders in iedem landt gefunden, unnd darin beschehen sey. Alles mit figuren und schönen landt taflen erklert, und für augen gestelt. Getruckt zů Basel durch Henrichum Petri. Anno M. D. XLiiij [1544].&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, both titles (''Cosmographia universalis'' and ''Cosmographia Universalis'') or the year is wrong (that it's not 1544 from the first German edition, but some later year and edition).&lt;br /&gt; Also on which page is the prayer (or in which section if there are no page numbers)?|date=November 2020}}

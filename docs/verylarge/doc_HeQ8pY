[[File:Bust of Elagabalus - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Elagabalus]]]]
__NOTOC__
Year '''219''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCXIX]]''') was a [[common year starting on Friday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Antonius and Sacerdos''' (or, less frequently, '''year 972 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 219 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

A '''CT scan''' or '''computed tomography scan''' (formerly known as a '''computed axial tomography''' or '''CAT scan''') is a medical [[image|imaging]] [[Scientific technique|technique]] that uses computer-processed combinations of multiple [[X-ray]] measurements taken from different angles to produce [[Tomography |tomographic]] (cross-sectional) images (virtual &quot;slices&quot;) of a body, allowing the user to see inside the body without cutting. The personnel that perform CT scans are called ''[[radiographer]]s'' or ''radiologic technologists''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arrt.org/Patient-Public/Patient-Page |title=Patient Page |website= ARRT – The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141109192141/https://www.arrt.org/Patient-Public/Patient-Page |archive-date=9 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asrt.org/main/standards-regulations/state-legislative-affairs/individual-state-licensure-info | title=Individual State Licensure Information | publisher=American Society of Radiologic Technologists | access-date=19 July 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718215951/http://www.asrt.org/main/standards-regulations/state-legislative-affairs/individual-state-licensure-info | archive-date=18 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded jointly to South African American physicist [[Allan M. Cormack]] and British electrical engineer [[Godfrey N. Hounsfield]] &quot;for the development of computer assisted tomography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1979/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1979|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the images generated in CT scans were in the [[transverse plane|transverse]] (axial) [[anatomical plane]], perpendicular to the long axis of the body. Modern scanners allow the scan data to be reformatted as images in other [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]s. [[Geometry processing|Digital geometry processing]] can generate a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of an object inside the body from a series of two-dimensional [[radiography|radiographic]] images taken by [[rotation around a fixed axis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;Herman, G.

==Medical use==
Since its introduction in the 1970s, CT has become an important tool in [[medical imaging]] to supplement [[X-ray]]s and [[medical ultrasonography]]. It has more recently been used for [[preventive medicine]] or [[screening (medicine)|screening]] for disease, for example [[Ct colonography|CT colonography]] for people with a high risk of [[colon cancer]], or full-motion heart scans for people with high risk of heart disease. A number of institutions offer [[full-body scan]]s for the general population although this practice goes against the advice and official position of many professional organizations in the field primarily due to the [[radiation dose]] applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.org/documents/ctscreening_ps018-0.pdf|title=CT Screening|website=hps.org|access-date=1 May 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013203907/http://hps.org/documents/ctscreening_ps018-0.pdf|archive-date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Computed tomography of human brain - large.png|thumb|Computed tomography of [[human brain]], from [[base of the skull]] to top. Taken with intravenous contrast medium. {{noprint|[[Commons:Scrollable computed tomography images of a normal brain]]}}]]
CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect [[infarction]], tumors, [[calcification]]s, [[haemorrhage]], and bone trauma. Of the above, [[hypodense]] (dark) structures can indicate [[edema]] and infarction, hyperdense (bright) structures indicate calcifications and haemorrhage and bone trauma can be seen as disjunction in bone windows. Tumors can be detected by the swelling and anatomical distortion they cause, or by surrounding edema. Ambulances equipped with small bore multi-slice CT scanners respond to cases involving stroke or head trauma. CT scanning of the head is also used in CT-[[image guided surgery|guided]] [[stereotactic surgery]] and [[radiosurgery]] for treatment of intracranial tumors, [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the [[N-localizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Galloway | first1 = RL Jr. | editor1-last = Golby | editor1-first = AJ | title = Image-Guided Neurosurgery | chapter = Introduction and Historical Perspectives on Image-Guided Surgery | pages = 3–4 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tse | first1 = VCK | last2 = Kalani | first2 = MYS | last3 = Adler | first3 = JR | editor1-last = Chin | editor1-first = LS | editor2-last = Regine | editor2-first = WF |title = Principles and Practice of Stereotactic Radiosurgery | chapter = Techniques of Stereotactic Localization | page = 28 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Saleh | first1 = H | last2 = Kassas | first2 = B | editor1-last = Benedict | editor1-first = SH | editor2-last = Schlesinger | editor2-first = DJ | editor3-last = Goetsch | editor3-first = SJ | editor4-last = Kavanagh | editor4-first = BD |title = Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy | chapter = Developing Stereotactic Frames for Cranial Treatment | pages = 156–159 | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Khan | first1 = FR | last2 = Henderson | first2 = JM | editor1-last = Lozano | editor1-first = AM | editor2-last = Hallet | editor2-first = M |title = Brain Stimulation: Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 116 |chapter = Deep Brain Stimulation Surgical Techniques | pages = 28–30 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arle | first = J | editor1-last = Lozano | editor1-first = AM | editor2-last = Gildenberg | editor2-first = PL | editor3-last = Tasker | editor3-first = RR |title = Textbook of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery | chapter = Development of a Classic: the Todd-Wells Apparatus, the BRW, and the CRW Stereotactic Frames | pages = 456–461 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown RA, Nelson JA |title=Invention of the N-localizer for stereotactic neurosurgery and its use in the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=70 |issue=2 Supplement Operative |pages=173–176 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22186842 |doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e318246a4f7|s2cid=36350612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CT scan can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|lung parenchyma]], the tissue of the [[lung]]s. It is particularly relevant here because normal two-dimensional X-rays do not show such defects. A variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality. For evaluation of chronic interstitial processes such as [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and [[Pulmonary fibrosis#|fibrosis]], thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstructions are used; often scans are performed both on inspiration and expiration. This special technique is called [[high resolution CT]] that produces a sampling of the lung, and not continuous images.

===Angiography===
[[File:SADDLE PE.JPG|thumb|Example of a CTPA, demonstrating a saddle [[pulmonary embolism|embolus]] (dark horizontal line) occluding the [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]] (bright white triangle)]]
{{Main|Computed tomography angiography}}

[[Computed tomography angiography]] (CTA) is [[contrast CT]] to visualize the [[arteries]] and [[vein]]s throughout the body.  This ranges from arteries serving the [[brain]] to those bringing blood to the [[lung]]s, [[kidney]]s, [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s. An example of this type of exam is [[CT pulmonary angiogram]] (CTPA) used to diagnose [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE). It employs computed tomography and an [[iodinated contrast|iodine-based contrast agent]] to obtain an image of the [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]].

===Cardiac===

The main forms of cardiac CT scanning are:
*[[Coronary CT angiography]] (CTA): the use of CT to assess the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] of the [[heart]]. The subject receives an [[intravenous injection]] of [[radiocontrast]], and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually in order to diagnose coronary artery disease.
*[[Coronary CT calcium scan]]: also used for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of heart attack.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart scan (coronary calcium scan)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/basics/definition/prc-20015000|publisher=Mayo Clinic|access-date=9 August 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905084216/http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/basics/definition/prc-20015000|archive-date=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical coronary CT calcium scan is done without the use of radiocontrast, but it can possibly be done from contrast-enhanced images as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;van der BijlJoemai2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Bijl|first1=Noortje|last2=Joemai|first2=Raoul M.

To better visualize the anatomy, post-processing of the images is common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wichmann&quot;/&gt; Most common are multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) and [[volume rendering]]. For more complex anatomies and procedures, such as heart valve interventions, a true [[3D reconstruction]] or a 3D print is created based on these CT images to gain a deeper understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vukicevic|first1=Marija|last2=Mosadegh|first2=Bobak|last3=Min|first3=James K.|last4=Little|first4=Stephen H.|date=February 2017|title=Cardiac 3D Printing and its Future Directions|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging|volume=10|issue=2|pages=171–184|doi=10.1016/j.jcmg.2016.12.001|issn=1876-7591|pmc=5664227|pmid=28183437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.materialise.com/en/blog/innovative-mitral-valve-treatment-3d-visualization-at-henry-ford|title=Innovative Mitral Valve Treatment with 3D Visualization at Henry Ford|website=Materialise|access-date=2017-11-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043336/http://www.materialise.com/en/blog/innovative-mitral-valve-treatment-3d-visualization-at-henry-ford|archive-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Dee Dee|last2=Eng|first2=Marvin|last3=Greenbaum|first3=Adam|last4=Myers|first4=Eric|last5=Forbes|first5=Michael|last6=Pantelic|first6=Milan|last7=Song|first7=Thomas|last8=Nelson|first8=Christina|last9=Divine|first9=George|date=November 2016|title=Predicting LVOT Obstruction After TMVR|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging|volume=9|issue=11|pages=1349–1352|doi=10.1016/j.jcmg.2016.01.017|issn=1876-7591|pmc=5106323|pmid=27209112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Stephan|last2=Grunert|first2=Ronny|last3=Mohr|first3=Friedrich W.|last4=Falk|first4=Volkmar|date=February 2008|title=3D-Imaging of cardiac structures using 3D heart models for planning in heart surgery: a preliminary study|journal=Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=6–9|doi=10.1510/icvts.2007.156588|issn=1569-9285|pmid=17925319|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Abdominal and pelvic CT}}
CT is an accurate technique for diagnosis of [[Human abdomen|abdominal]] diseases. Its uses include diagnosis and staging of cancer, as well as follow up after cancer treatment to assess response. It is commonly used to investigate [[acute abdominal pain]].

===Axial skeleton and extremities===

For the [[axial skeleton]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]], CT is often used to image complex [[fracture (bone)|fracture]]s, especially ones around joints, because of its ability to reconstruct the area of interest in multiple planes. Fractures, ligamentous injuries, and [[Dislocation (medicine)|dislocations]] can easily be recognised with a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00391| title=Ankle Fractures| publisher=American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons| website=orthoinfo.aaos.org| access-date=30 May 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530103553/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00391| archive-date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Musculoskeletal Imaging with Multislice CT| author= Buckwalter, Kenneth A. | journal=American Journal of Roentgenology| volume=176| issue=4| pages=979–986| date=11 September 2000|display-authors=etal| doi=10.2214/ajr.176.4.1760979| pmid=11264094}}&lt;/ref&gt; With modern dual-energy CT scanners, new areas of use have been established, such as aiding in the diagnosis of [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ramon|first1=André|last2=Bohm-Sigrand|first2=Amélie|last3=Pottecher|first3=Pierre|last4=Richette|first4=Pascal|last5=Maillefert|first5=Jean-Francis|last6=Devilliers|first6=Herve|last7=Ornetti|first7=Paul|date=2018-03-01|title=Role of dual-energy CT in the diagnosis and follow-up of gout: systematic analysis of the literature|journal=Clinical Rheumatology|volume=37|issue=3|pages=587–595|doi=10.1007/s10067-017-3976-z|pmid=29350330|s2cid=3686099|issn=0770-3198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geological use ==
X-ray CT is used in geological studies to quickly reveal materials inside a drill core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/chikyu/e/about/laboratory.html|title=Laboratory {{!}} About Chikyu {{!}} The Deep-sea Scientific Drilling Vessel CHIKYU|website=www.jamstec.go.jp|access-date=2019-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense minerals such as pyrite and barite appear brighter and less dense components such as clay appear dull in CT images.

== Cultural heritage use ==
X-ray CT and [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] can also be used for the conservation and preservation of objects of cultural heritage. For many fragile objects, direct research and observation can be damaging and can degrade the object over time. Using CT scans, conservators and researchers are able to determine the material composition of the objects they are exploring, such as the position of ink along the layers of a scroll, without any additional harm. These scans have been optimal for research focused on the workings of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] or the text hidden inside the charred outer layers of the [[En-Gedi Scroll]]. However, they are not optimal for every object subject to these kinds of research questions, as there are certain artifacts like the [[Herculaneum papyri]] in which the material composition has very little variation along the inside of the object. After scanning these objects, computational methods can be employed to examine the insides of these objects, as was the case with the virtual unwrapping of the [[En-Gedi Scroll#Recovery|En-Gedi scroll]] and the [[Herculaneum papyri#Virtual unrolling|Herculaneum papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seales|first1=W.

==Advantages==
CT scanning has several advantages over traditional [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] medical [[radiography]]. First, CT eliminates the superimposition of images of structures outside the area of interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Second, CT scans have greater [[image resolution]], enabling examination of finer details.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} CT can distinguish between [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s that differ in radiographic [[density]] by  1% or less.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Third, CT scanning enables multiplanar reformatted imaging: scan data can be visualized in the [[transverse plane|transverse (or axial)]], [[Coronal plane|coronal]], or [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] plane, depending on the diagnostic task.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The improved resolution of CT has permitted the development of new investigations. For example, CT [[angiography]] avoids the invasive insertion of a [[catheter]]. CT scanning can perform a [[virtual colonoscopy]] with greater accuracy and less discomfort for the patient than a traditional [[colonoscopy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heiken&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Heiken | first=JP |author2=Peterson CM |author3=Menias CO  | title=Virtual colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening: current status: Wednesday 5 October 2005, 14:00–16:00 | journal=Cancer Imaging | volume=5 | issue=Spec No A | pages=S133–S139 | publisher=International Cancer Imaging Society | date=November 2005 | pmid=16361129 | doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2005.0108 | pmc=1665314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16106357&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bielen DJ |title=Clinical validation of high-resolution fast spin-echo MR colonography after colon distention with air |journal=J Magn Reson Imaging |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=400–5 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16106357 |doi=10.1002/jmri.20397 |name-list-style=vanc|author2=Bosmans HT |author3=De Wever LL |display-authors=3 |last4=Maes |first4=Frederik |last5=Tejpar |first5=Sabine |last6=Vanbeckevoort |first6=Dirk |last7=Marchal |first7=Guy J.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual colonography is far more accurate than a [[barium enema]] for detection of tumors and uses a lower radiation dose.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} CT VC is increasingly being used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and US as a screening test for colon polyps and colon cancer and can negate the need for a [[colonoscopy]] in some cases.

CT is a moderate- to high-[[radiation]] diagnostic technique. The radiation dose for a particular examination depends on multiple factors: volume scanned, patient build, number and type of scan sequences, and desired resolution and image quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Žabić S, Wang Q, Morton T, Brown KM |title=A low dose simulation tool for CT systems with energy integrating detectors |journal=Medical Physics|volume=40|issue=3 |pages=031102 |date=March 2013 |doi=10.1118/1.4789628|pmid=23464282 |bibcode = 2013MedPh..40c1102Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two helical CT scanning parameters, tube current and pitch, can be adjusted easily and have a profound effect on radiation. CT scanning is more accurate than two-dimensional radiographs in evaluating anterior interbody fusion,  although they may still over-read the extent of fusion.&lt;ref&gt;Brian R.

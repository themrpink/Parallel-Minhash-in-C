According to [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewontin|first1=Richard C.|title=The genetic basis of evolutionary change|url=https://archive.org/details/geneticbasisofev00lewo|url-access=registration|date=1974|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231083188|edition=[4th printing.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theoretical task for population genetics is a process in two spaces: a &quot;genotypic space&quot; and a &quot;phenotypic space&quot;. The challenge of a ''complete'' theory of population genetics is to provide a set of laws that predictably map a population of [[genotype]]s (''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to a [[phenotype]] space (''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), where [[natural selection|selection]] takes place, and another set of laws that map the resulting population (''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) back to genotype space (''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) where [[Mendelism|Mendelian]] genetics can predict the next generation of genotypes, thus completing the cycle. Even if non-Mendelian aspects of [[molecular genetics]] are ignored, this is a gargantuan task. Visualizing the transformation schematically:

:&lt;math&gt;G_1 \; \stackrel{T_1}{\rightarrow} \; P_1 \; \stackrel{T_2}{\rightarrow} \; P_2 \; \stackrel{T_3}{\rightarrow} \; G_2 \;
\stackrel{T_4}{\rightarrow} \; G_1' \; \rightarrow \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

(adapted from Lewontin 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;12). ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the genetic and [[epigenetic]] laws, the aspects of functional biology, or [[developmental biology|development]], that transform a genotype into phenotype. This is the &quot;[[genotype-phenotype map]]&quot;. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the transformation due to natural selection, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are epigenetic relations that predict genotypes based on the selected phenotypes and finally ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; the rules of Mendelian genetics.

In practice, there are two bodies of evolutionary theory that exist in parallel, traditional population genetics operating in the genotype space and the [[biometry|biometric]] theory used in [[plant breeding|plant]] and [[animal breeding]], operating in phenotype space. The missing part is the mapping between the genotype and phenotype space. This leads to a &quot;sleight of hand&quot; (as Lewontin terms it) whereby variables in the equations of one domain, are considered parameters or ''constants'', where, in a full-treatment they would be transformed themselves by the evolutionary process and are ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]s'' of the state variables in the other domain. The &quot;sleight of hand&quot; is assuming that the mapping is known. Proceeding as if it is understood is enough to analyze many cases of interest. For example, if the phenotype is almost one-to-one with genotype ([[sickle-cell disease]]) or the time-scale is sufficiently short, the &quot;constants&quot; can be treated as such; however, there are also many situations where that assumption does not hold.

'''Biomimetics''' or '''biomimicry''' is the emulation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex [[human]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F. V.|title=Biomimetics: its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=3|issue=9|pages=471–482|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643|date=22 August 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms &quot;biomimetics&quot; and &quot;biomimicry&quot; are derived from {{lang-grc|βίος}} (''bios''), life, and μίμησις (''[[mimesis|mīmēsis]]''), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (''mīmeisthai''), to imitate, from μῖμος (''mimos''), actor. A closely related field is '''[[bionics]]'''.&lt;ref name=McCarty/&gt;

Living organisms have [[evolution|evolved]] [[adaptation (biology)|well-adapted]] structures and materials over geological time through [[natural selection]]. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by [[biological]] solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, [[hydrophobicity]], self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.

== History ==

One of the early examples of  biomimicry was the study of [[birds]] to enable [[human flight]]. Although never successful in creating a &quot;flying machine&quot;, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of &quot;flying machines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romei 2008 56&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Romei | first=Francesca | title=Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher=The Oliver Press  | year=2008 | location=| page=56 | isbn=978-1-934545-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wright Brothers]], who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last=Howard | first=Fred | title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers | publisher=Dober Publications | year=1998 | location=| page=33 | isbn=978-0-486-40297-0 | quote = According to Wilbur, he and his brother discovered the birds' method of lateral control one day while observing a flight of pigeons.

[[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|machine]] with wings based closely upon the structure of bat wings.]]During the 1950s the American [[biophysicist]] and [[polymath]] [[Otto Schmitt]] developed the concept of &quot;biomimetics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent |first= Julian F.V. |author2= Bogatyreva, Olga A. |author3= Bogatyrev, Nikolaj R. |author4= Bowyer, Adrian |author5= Pahl, Anja-Karina |title= Biomimetics: its practice and theory |journal= Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date= 21 August 2006|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 471–482|doi= 10.1098/rsif.2006.0127 |pmid= 16849244 |pmc= 1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his doctoral research he developed the [[Schmitt trigger]] by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of [[nerve impulse|nerve propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Otto H. Schmitt, Como People of the Past |url= https://sites.google.com/a/comogreenvillage.info/como-history/home/people-of-the-past-documents/como-people-of-the-past/otto-h-schmitt |publisher= Connie Sullivan, Como History Article |quote=He developed the trigger by studying the nerves in squid and trying to engineer a device that replicated the natural system by which squid nerves propagate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to focus on devices that mimic natural systems and by 1957 he had perceived a converse to the standard view of [[biophysics]] at that time, a view he would come to call biomimetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent2006&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely, biophysics is also a biologist's approach to problems of physical science and engineering, although this aspect has largely been neglected.|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1960 [[Jack E. Steele]] coined a similar term, ''[[bionics]]'', at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as &quot;the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarty&quot;&gt;Mary McCarty. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604025951/http://www.daytondailynews.com/o/content/oh/story/opinions/columns/2009/01/29/ddn012909mary.html?cxntlid=inform_sr &quot;Life of bionics founder a fine adventure&quot;]. ''Dayton Daily News'', 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vincent-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent|first= Julian F. V. |title= Biomimetics — a review|journal= Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine |date= November 2009|volume= 223 |issue= 8 |pages= 919–939 |doi= 10.1243/09544119JEIM561|pmid= 20092091 |s2cid= 21895651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a later meeting in 1963 Schmitt stated,

{{quote|Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research.|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1969, Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt O. Third Int. Biophysics Congress. 1969. Some interesting and useful biomimetic transforms. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1974 it had found its way into [[Webster's Dictionary]], bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as &quot;a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems&quot;. Bionic took on a different connotation when [[Martin Caidin]] referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' which later resulted in the 1974 television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with &quot;the use of electronically operated artificial body parts&quot; and &quot;having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |year=2008 |location= |isbn=978-0-19-953296-4|last1=Soanes |first1=Catherine |last2=Hawker |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term ''bionic'' took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in [[english language|English]] speaking countries largely abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =JFV | title = Biomimetics — a review| journal =Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine | volume =223 | issue=8| pages=919–939 | year=2009 | url=| issn=| doi =10.1243/09544119JEIM561| pmid =20092091 | s2cid =21895651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biomimicry'' appeared as early as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Merrill | first=Connie Lange | title=Biomimicry of the Dioxygen Active Site in the Copper Proteins Hemocyanin and Cytochrome Oxidase  | location=Rice University  | year=1982  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author [[Janine Benyus]] in her 1997 book ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a &quot;new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems&quot;. Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a &quot;Model, Measure, and Mentor&quot; and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benyus 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the latest examples of biomimicry has been created by Johannes-Paul Fladerer and Ernst Kurzmann by the description of &quot;managemANT&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kurzmann |first1=Ernst |last2=Fladerer |first2=Johannes-Paul |title=ManagemANT Was Fach- und Führungskräfte von Ameisen lernen können |date=2017 |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Buch |isbn=9783956012082 |edition=1. Auflage}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term (a combination of the words &quot;management&quot; and &quot;ant&quot;), describes the usage of behavioural strategies of ants in economic and management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fladerer |first1=Johannes-Paul |last2=Kurzmann |first2=Ernst |title=WISDOM OF THE MANY : how to create self -organisation and how to use collective... intelligence in companies and in society from mana. |date=November 2019 |publisher=BOOKS ON DEMAND |isbn=9783750422421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bio-inspired technologies ==
Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan|first1=Bharat|date=15 March 2009|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature-an overview|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|pmid=19324719|bibcode=2009RSPTA.367.1445B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray's law]], which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.&lt;ref name=&quot;williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomimetic Architecture ===
Living beings have adapted to a constantly changing environment during evolution through mutation, recombination, and selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967523159|title=Biomimetic research for architecture and building construction : biological design and integrative structures|date=2016|publisher=Springer|others=Knippers, Jan., Nickel, Klaus G., Speck, Thomas.|isbn=978-3-319-46374-2|location=Cham|oclc=967523159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea of the biomimetic philosophy is that nature’s inhabitants including animals, plants, and microbes have the most experience in solving problems and have already found the most appropriate ways to last on planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=George R.|date=1963|title=Antonio Gaudi: Structure and Form|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1566905|journal=Perspecta|volume=8|pages=63|doi=10.2307/1566905|issn=0079-0958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, biomimetic architecture seeks solutions for building sustainability present in nature.

The 21st century has seen a ubiquitous waste of energy due to inefficient building designs, in addition to the over-utilization of energy during the operational phase of its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radwan|first=Gehan.A.N.|last2=Osama|first2=Nouran|date=2016|title=Biomimicry, an Approach, for Energy Effecient Building Skin Design|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878029616300391|journal=Procedia Environmental Sciences|language=en|volume=34|pages=178–189|doi=10.1016/j.proenv.2016.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, recent advancements in fabrication techniques, computational imaging, and simulation tools have opened up new possibilities to mimic nature across different architectural scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; As a result, there has been a rapid growth in devising innovative design approaches and solutions to counter energy problems. Biomimetic architecture is one of these multi-disciplinary approaches to [[sustainable design]] that follows a set of principles rather than stylistic codes, going beyond using nature as inspiration for the aesthetic components of built form but instead seeking to use nature to solve problems of the building's functioning and saving energy.

==== Characteristics ====
The term Biomimetic architecture refers to the study and application of construction principles which are found in natural environments and species, and are translated into the design of sustainable solutions for architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Biomimetic architecture uses nature as a model, measure and mentor for providing architectural solutions across scales, which are inspired by natural organisms that have solved similar problems in nature. Using nature as a measure refers to using an ecological standard of measuring sustainability, and efficiency of man-made innovations, while the term mentor refers to learning from natural principles and using biology as an inspirational source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benyus 1997&quot; /&gt;

Biomorphic architecture, also referred to as Bio-decoration,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; on the other hand, refers to the use of formal and geometric elements found in nature, as a source of inspiration for aesthetic properties in designed architecture, and may not necessarily have non-physical, or economic functions. A historic example of biomorphic architecture dates back to Egyptian, Greek and Roman cultures, using tree and plant forms in the ornamentation of structural columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aziz|first=Moheb Sabry|last2=El sherif|first2=Amr Y.|date=March 2016|title=Biomimicry as an approach for bio-inspired structure with the aid of computation|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1110016815001702|journal=Alexandria Engineering Journal|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=707–714|doi=10.1016/j.aej.2015.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Procedures ====
Within Biomimetic architecture, two basic procedures can be identified, namely, the bottom-up approach (biology push) and top-down approach (technology pull).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Speck|first=Thomas|title=Emergence in Biomimetic Materials Systems|date=2019|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-06128-9_5|work=Emergence and Modularity in Life Sciences|pages=97–115|editor-last=Wegner|editor-first=Lars H.|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-06128-9_5|isbn=978-3-030-06127-2|access-date=2020-11-23|last2=Speck|first2=Olga|editor2-last=Lüttge|editor2-first=Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between the two approaches is blurry with the possibility of transition between the two, depending on each individual case. Biomimetic architecture is typically carried out in interdisciplinary teams in which biologists and  other natural scientists work in collaboration with engineers, material scientists, architects, designers, mathematicians and computer scientists.

In the bottom-up approach, the starting point is a new result from basic biological research promising for biomimetic implementation. For example, developing a biomimetic material system after  the quantitative analysis of the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of a biological system.

In the top-down approach, biomimetic innovations are sought for already existing developments that have been successfully established on the market. The cooperation focuses on the improvement or further development of an existing product.

==== Examples ====
Researchers studied the [[termite]]'s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their [[termite mound]]s in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C (35&amp;nbsp;°F to 104&amp;nbsp;°F). Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human [[building design]]. The [[Eastgate Centre, Harare|Eastgate Centre]], a mid-rise office complex in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biomimicry.org/biomimicry-examples/|title=The Biomimicry Institute - Examples of nature-inspired sustainable design|website=Biomimicry Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; stays cool without air conditioning and uses only 10% of the energy of a conventional building of the same size.
[[File:Co op Building dual facade.jpg|thumb|A [[Waagner-Biro]] double-skin facade being assembled at [[One Angel Square]], [[Manchester]]. The brown outer facade can be seen being assembled to the inner white facade via struts. These struts create a walkway between both 'skins' for ventilation, solar shading and maintenance]]
Researchers in the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] were inspired by the natural ventilation in termite mounds and designed a double façade that significantly cuts down over lit areas in a building. Scientists have imitated the porous nature of mound walls by designing a facade with double panels that was able to reduce heat gained by radiation and increase heat loss by convection in cavity between the two panels. The overall cooling load on the building’s energy consumption was reduced by 15%.&lt;ref&gt;El Ahmar, Salma &amp; Fioravanti, Antonio. (2015). Biomimetic-Computational Design for Double Facades in Hot Climates: A Porous Folded Façade for Office Buildings.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar inspiration was drawn from the porous walls of termite mounds to design a naturally ventilated façade with a small ventilation gap. This design of façade is able to induce air flow due to the [[Venturi effect]] and continuously circulates rising air in the ventilation slot.

Scientists in [[Shanghai University]] were able to replicate the complex microstructure of clay-made conduit network in the mound to mimic the excellent humidity control in mounds.  They proposed a porous humidity control material (HCM) using [[Sepiolite]] and [[calcium chloride]] with water vapor adsorption-desorption content at 550 grams per meter squared. Calcium chloride is a [[desiccant]] and improves the water vapor adsorption-desorption property of the Bio-HCM. The proposed bio-HCM has a regime of interfiber mesopores which acts as a mini reservoir. The flexural strength of the proposed material was estimated to be 10.3 MPa using computational simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Xiaopeng |last2=Chen |first2=Zhang |last3=Yang |first3=Guang |last4=Gao |first4=Yanfeng |title=Bioinspired Ant-Nest-Like Hierarchical Porous Material Using CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as Additive for Smart Indoor Humidity Control |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research |date=2 April 2019 |volume=58 |issue=17 |pages=7139–7145 |doi=10.1021/acs.iecr.8b06092 |url=https://figshare.com/articles/Bioinspired_Ant-Nest-Like_Hierarchical_Porous_Material_Using_CaCl_sub_2_sub_as_Additive_for_Smart_Indoor_Humidity_Control/7940336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lan |first1=Haoran |last2=Jing |first2=Zhenzi |last3=Li |first3=Jian |last4=Miao |first4=Jiajun |last5=Chen |first5=Yuqian |title=Influence of pore dimensions of materials on humidity self-regulating performances |journal=Materials Letters |date=October 2017 |volume=204 |pages=23–26 |doi=10.1016/j.matlet.2017.05.095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of [[stiffness]], strength, and [[toughness]].

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Bio-Synthetic Hybrid Materials and Bionanoparticles, Editors: Alexander Boker, Patrick van Rijn, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2016, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-210-9&lt;/ref&gt; In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from [[Nanoscopic scale|nano]]- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. [[Bone]], [[nacre]] (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;materials&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wegst|first1=Ulrike G.

Marine [[mussel]]s can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents.

Other research has proposed adhesive glue from [[mussel]]s.

==== Dry adhesion ====
Leg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g. [[beetle]]s and [[Fly|flies]]), [[spider]]s and [[lizard]]s (e.g. [[gecko]]s), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as [[seta]]e. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/|title=New Scientist &amp;#124; Science news and science articles from New Scientist|website=www.newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; boots and tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/mota/education/Physics%2087N%20Final%20Projects/Group%20Gamma/gecko.htm|title=Gecko Tape|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic setae]] have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.

[[Biomimetic material]]s are gaining increasing attention in the field of [[optics]] and [[photonics]]. There are still little known [[Bio-inspired photonics|bioinspired or biomimetic products]] involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products.

===Multi-user===
{{main|MP/M}}
In 1979, a multi-user compatible derivative of CP/M was released. [[MP/M]] allowed multiple users to connect to a single computer, using multiple [[computer terminal|terminals]] to provide each user with a screen and keyboard.  Later versions ran on 16-bit processors.

==={{anchor|3.0}}CP/M Plus===
[[File:CP-M Plus System Guide.jpg|thumb|right|CP/M Plus (CP/M 3) System Guide]]
The last 8-bit version of CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M&amp;nbsp;Plus, released in 1983. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of [[MP/M]] in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M&amp;nbsp;2.2 applications. CP/M&amp;nbsp;3 could therefore use more than 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The system could be configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann83&quot;/&gt; CP/M&amp;nbsp;3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the [[Amstrad PCW]], the [[Amstrad CPC]], the [[ZX Spectrum +3]], the [[Commodore 128]], [[MSX]] machines and the [[Radio Shack]] [[TRS-80 Model 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio_Shack_1985&quot;/&gt;

==={{anchor|CP/M-68K|CP/M-8000|Portable CP/M|GEMDOS}}The 16-bit world===
[[File:PRO CPM-80.jpg|thumb|right|DEC PRO-CP/M-80 floppy disk distribution for the Z80-A co-processor in a DEC Professional 3xx series.]]
There were versions of CP/M for some [[16-bit]] CPUs as well.

The first version in the 16-bit family was [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]] in November 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital_Research_1981_News&quot;/&gt; At this point, the original [[8-bit]] CP/M became known by the [[retronym]] '''CP/M-80''' to avoid confusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital_Research_1981_News&quot;/&gt;

CP/M-86 was expected to be the standard operating system of the new [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PCs]], but DRI and [[IBM]] were unable to negotiate development and licensing terms. IBM turned to Microsoft instead, and Microsoft delivered [[PC&amp;nbsp;DOS]] based on [[86-DOS]]. Although CP/M-86 became an option for the IBM PC after DRI threatened legal action, it never overtook Microsoft's system. Most customers were repelled by the significantly greater price IBM charged for CP/M-86 over PC DOS ({{currency|amount=240|code=USD|linked=yes}} and {{currency|amount=40|code=USD|linked=no}}, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maher_2017&quot;/&gt;

When [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) put out the [[Rainbow 100]] to compete with IBM, it came with CP/M-80 using a Z80 chip, CP/M-86 or MS-DOS using an 8088 microprocessor, or [[CP/M-86/80]] using both. The Z80 and 8088 CPUs ran concurrently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kildall_1982_8-bit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snyder198306&quot;/&gt; A benefit of the Rainbow was that it could continue to run 8-bit CP/M software, preserving a user's possibly sizable investment as they moved into the 16-bit world of MS-DOS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kildall_1982_8-bit&quot;/&gt; A similar [[multiprocessing|dual-processor]] adaption for the {{ill|CompuPro System 816|sr|Compupro System 816}} was named [[CP/M 8-16]]. The CP/M-86 adaptation for the 8085/8088-based [[Zenith Z-100]] also supported running programs for both of its CPUs.

Soon following CP/M-86, another 16-bit version of CP/M was '''CP/M-68K''' for the [[Motorola 68000]]. The original version of CP/M-68K in 1982 was written in [[Pascal/MT+68k]], but it was ported to C later on. CP/M-68K, already running on the Motorola [[EXORmacs]] systems, was initially to be used in the [[Atari ST]] computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer disk operating system called [[GEMDOS]]. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;M68&quot;/&gt;

In 1982 there was also a port from CP/M-68K to the 16-bit [[Zilog Z8000]] for the [[Olivetti M20]], written in [[C (language)|C]], named '''CP/M-8000'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas_1981_CPM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmstead&quot;/&gt;

These 16-bit versions of CP/M required application programs to be re-compiled for the new CPUs or if they were written in [[assembly language]], to be [[assembly language translator|translated]] using tools like Digital Research's [[XLT86]], a program written by Gary Kildall in 1981, which translated .ASM source code for the Intel 8080 processor into .A86 source code for the Intel 8086. Using global data flow analysis on 8080 register usage, the translator would also optimize the output for code size and take care of calling conventions, so that [[CP/M-80]] and [[MP/M-80]] programs could be ported to the [[CP/M-86]] and [[MP/M-86]] platforms automatically. XLT86 itself was written in [[PL/I-80]] and was available for CP/M-80 platforms as well as for [[DEC VMS]] (for [[VAX 11/750]] or [[VAX 11/780|11/780]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DR_1981_XLT&quot;/&gt;

===MS-DOS takes over===
Many expected that CP/M would be the standard operating system for 16-bit computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pournelle198403&quot;/&gt; In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at [[Bill Gates]]' suggestion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Isaacson_2014&quot;/&gt; to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the [[IBM Personal Computer]]. Upon the failure to obtain a signed [[non-disclosure agreement]], the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellis_2010&quot;/&gt; The resulting product, [[MS-DOS]], soon began outselling CP/M.

Many of the basic concepts and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (&lt;code&gt;A:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;B:&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] [[file system]]. This similarity made it easier to port popular CP/M software like [[WordStar]] and [[dBase]]. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16&amp;nbsp;KB if necessary), more commands were built into the [[command.com|command-line shell]], making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.

Although one of the first peripherals for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software,&lt;ref name=&quot;magid1982febmar&quot;/&gt; CP/M rapidly lost market share as the microcomputing market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine, at the time one of the leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S-100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. A 1984 article in ''InfoWorld'' stated that efforts to introduce CP/M to the home market had been largely unsuccessful and most CP/M software was too expensive for home users,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mace_1984&quot;/&gt; and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groth_1986&quot;/&gt;

Later versions of CP/M-86 made significant strides in performance and usability and were made compatible with MS-DOS. To reflect this compatibility the name was changed, and CP/M-86 became [[DOS Plus]], which in turn became [[DR-DOS]].

===ZCPR===
ZCPR&lt;ref name=&quot;ZCPR&quot;/&gt; (the Z80 Command Processor Replacement) was introduced on 2 February 1982 as a drop-in replacement for the standard Digital Research console command processor (CCP) and was initially written by a group of computer hobbyists who called themselves &quot;The CCP Group&quot;. They were Frank Wancho, Keith Petersen (the archivist behind [[Simtel]] at the time), Ron Fowler, Charlie Strom, Bob Mathias, and Richard Conn. Richard was, in fact, the driving force in this group (all of whom maintained contact through email).

ZCPR1 was released on a disk put out by SIG/M (Special Interest Group/Microcomputers), a part of the Amateur Computer Club of [[New Jersey]].

ZCPR2 was released on 14 February 1983. It was released as a set of ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, permitting the use of ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.

ZCPR3&lt;ref name=&quot;ZCPR3&quot;/&gt; was released on 14 July 1984, as a set of nine disks from SIG/M. The code for ZCPR3 could also be compiled (with reduced features) for the 8080 and would run on systems that did not have the requisite [[Z80]] microprocessor.

In January 1987, Richard Conn stopped developing ZCPR, and Echelon asked Jay Sage (who already had a privately enhanced ZCPR 3.1) to continue work on it. Thus, ZCPR 3.3 was developed and released. ZCPR 3.3 no longer supported the 8080 series of microprocessors, and added the most features of any upgrade in the ZCPR line.

Features of ZCPR as of version 3 included:
* shells
* aliases
* I/O redirection
* flow control
* named directories
* search paths
* custom menus
* passwords
* on line help

ZCPR3.3 also included a full complement of utilities with considerably extended capabilities. While enthusiastically supported by the CP/M user base of the time, ZCPR alone was insufficient to slow the demise of CP/M.

==Legacy==
A number of behaviors exhibited by [[Microsoft Windows]] are a result of [[backward compatibility]] with MS-DOS, which in turn attempted some backward compatibility with CP/M. The [[drive letter]] and [[8.3 filename]] conventions in MS-DOS (and early Windows versions) were originally adopted from CP/M.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen_2010_Filenames&quot;/&gt; The [[Wildcard character|wildcard]] matching characters used by Windows (? and *) are based on those of CP/M,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen_2010_Wildcards&quot;/&gt; as are the reserved filenames used to [[Redirection (computing)|redirect]] output to a [[printer (computing)|printer]] (&quot;PRN:&quot;), and the [[System console|console]] (&quot;CON:&quot;). The drive names A and B were used to designate the two floppy disk drives that CP/M systems typically used; when hard drives appeared they were designated C, which survived into MS-DOS as the &lt;code&gt;C:\&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command prompt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen_2010_Reserved&quot;/&gt; The [[Substitute character|control character &lt;tt&gt;^Z&lt;/tt&gt;]] marking the [[End-of-file|end of some text files]] can also be attributed to CP/M.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chen_2004_CTRLZ&quot;/&gt; Various commands in DOS were modelled after CP/M commands, some of them even carried the same name like DIR, REN/RENAME, or TYPE (and ERA/ERASE in DR-DOS).

==={{anchor|Tim Olmstead}}Source code releases===
In 1997 and 1998 [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] released some CP/M&amp;nbsp;2.2 binaries and [[source code]] under an [[open source license]], also allowing the redistribution and modification of further collected Digital Research files related to the CP/M and MP/M families through Tim Olmstead's &quot;The Unofficial CP/M Web site&quot; since 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmstead_1997_1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmstead_1997_2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldera_1997_CP/M&quot;/&gt; After Olmstead's death on 12 September 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmstead_2001_Death&quot;/&gt; the distribution license was refreshed and expanded by [[Lineo]], who had meanwhile become the owner of those Digital Research assets, on 19 October 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparks_2001_CP/M&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaudry_2001_CP/M&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gasperson_2001_Collection&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swaine_2004_CP/M&quot;/&gt;

===Hobby and &quot;retro&quot; computing===
{{As of|2018}}, there are a number of active [[Retrocomputing|vintage, hobby and retro-computer]] people and groups, and some small commercial businesses, still developing and supporting compute platforms that use CP/M (mostly 2.2) as the host operating system.

The final success came when Glenn talked Gary into just separating the I/O from the rest of it, with Glenn promising to re-write the I/O module for the [[IMSAI 8080]] (which he did). So CPM on the [[IMSAI]] was a joint effort between Glenn and Gary. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[…] [[Glenn Ewing|Glenn]] knew this and he would be talking with [[Gary Kildall|Gary]], and he started twisting Gary's arm. He said, &quot;Hey Gary, why can't we run this in this IMSAI?&quot; &quot;The I/O's all different, won't run.&quot; But Glenn persists and finally makes a deal with Gary. He says, &quot;Okay Gary, if you split out the I/O, I'll write the BIOS, basic I/O's system,&quot; and Glenn named it then. &quot;We'll split it out separately. I'll write that part, as long as you can make a division in the program there.&quot; And he got Gary to do that and Glenn put those two pieces together and was running Gary's CP/M on an IMSAI. Glenn let us know that, and it wasn't too much later than [[Bill Millard|Bill]] was down there making arrangements with Gary Kildall to license CP/M. […] Now that the BIOS is separated out, anybody could write a BIOS for their machine, if it was 8080-based, and run this, so he started selling that separately under the company [[Digital Research]] that he formed and did quite well.&quot;|}}

[…] Vorteile des CP/A gegenüber CP/M 2.2. sind erweiterte Funktionalitäten. […] Herausragend sind […] Urladen des Systems aus einer Datei @OS.COM. Das System musste nicht in speziellen Systemspuren gespeichert werden. […] automatische Erkennung von Diskettenformaten […] eingebauter Systemmonitor […] Das CP/A wurde für Bürocomputer A5120, A5130 und den PC1715 ausgeliefert. […] Das CCP von CP/A ist ziemlich sicher ursprünglich aus einem reassemblierten CP/M-2.2-CCP entstanden; wurde aber konsequent auf Z80-Befehle umgearbeitet und vielfach verändert und erweitert.

{{N-bit|8|(1 [[Octet (computing)|octet]])}} '8-bit' is also a generation of [[microcomputer]]s in which 8-bit [[microprocessor]]s were the norm.

The term '8-bit' is also applied to the [[character set]]s that could be used on computers with 8-bit bytes, the best known being various forms of [[extended ASCII]], including the [[ISO/IEC 8859]] series of national character sets{{snd}} especially [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin 1]] for English and Western European languages.

The [[IBM System/360]] introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its [[general purpose registers]] were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the [[IBM System/360 Model 30]] (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Amdahl|first1=G.

The first widely adopted 8-bit [[microprocessor]] was the [[Intel 8080]], being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]]; it had 8-bit data words and 16-bit addresses. The [[Zilog Z80]] (compatible with the 8080) and the [[Motorola 6800]] were also used in similar computers. The Z80 and the [[MOS Technology 6502]] 8-bit CPUs were widely used in [[home computer]]s and [[Second generation of video game consoles|second-]] and [[Third generation of video game consoles|third-generation game consoles]] of the 1970s and 1980s. Many 8-bit CPUs or [[microcontroller]]s are the basis of today's ubiquitous [[embedded systems]].

==Details==
There are 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; (256) different possible values for 8 bits. When unsigned, it has possible values ranging from 0 to 255; when [[Sign (mathematics)|signed]], it has -128 to 127.

Eight-bit CPUs use an [[octet (computing)|8-bit]] [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] and can therefore access 8 bits of data in a single [[Instruction (computer science)|machine instruction]]. The address bus is typically a double octet wide (i.e. [[16-bit]]), due to practical and economical considerations. This implies a direct [[address space]] of only 64&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]] on most 8-bit processors.

==Notable 8-bit CPUs==
The first commercial 8-bit processor was the [[Intel 8008]] (1972) which was originally intended for the [[Datapoint 2200]] [[intelligent terminal]]. Most competitors to [[Intel]] started off with such character oriented 8-bit microprocessors. Modernized variants of these 8-bit machines are still one of the most common types of processor in embedded systems.

Another notable 8-bit CPU is the [[MOS Technology 6502]]; it, and variants of it, were used in a number of personal computers such as the [[Apple I]] and [[Apple II]], the [[Atari 8-bit family]], the [[BBC Micro]], and the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Commodore VIC-20]], and in a number of video game consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

'''Elián González Brotons''' (born December 6, 1993) is a Cuban citizen who became embroiled in a heated international custody and immigration controversy in 2000 involving the governments of Cuba and the United States, his father Juan Miguel González Quintana, his other relatives in Cuba and in Miami, and Miami's Cuban community.

González's mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez drowned in November 1999 while attempting to leave Cuba with González and her boyfriend to get to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/717071.stm |title=Elian's relatives at war |work=BBC News|date=April 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/nyregion/nyc-a-tug-of-war-as-complex-as-war.html |title=NYC; A Tug of War As Complex As War|last= Haberman| first= Clyde |newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elián Gonzalez was five years old when found nestled in an inner tube floating at sea three miles from Florida's Fort Lauderdale coast.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; Two fishermen found Elián and reluctantly handed him over to the U.S. Coast Guard, as they feared he would be sent back to Cuba under the wet foot, dry foot policy since he had not yet reached land.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; The Coast Guard assured them that Elián would be taken &quot;ashore for medical reasons,&quot; deeming him eligible to stay.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt;{{rp|152}} Elián was immediately taken to a hospital and treated for dehydration and minor cuts on his body.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; It was later found that Elián's mother, Elisabet Brotons Rodríguez, and Lázaro Munero García, her common-law husband, had escaped Cárdenas, Cuba, as part of a group with 14 refugees on a {{cvt|17|ft|adj=on}} boat.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; However, the others perished in a storm, while a young couple escaped to the shore, and Elián was found.

Once treated, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) provided Elián with a temporary deferral regarding his inspection, and further released Elián to his great-uncle, Lázaro Gonzalez, who lived with his family in Miami's Little Havana.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; These relatives informed the family in Cárdenas to prepare for an [[extreme hardship]] visa waiver. The former were told the next day that &quot;some functionary of the government would be coming to get the boy&quot; as a result of [[Fidel Castro]]'s having met with Juan Miguel, Elián's father.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt;{{rp|153}} The involvement of the Cuban [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist]] leader in the case and the subsequent diplomatic note written to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] emphasizing the father's demand for Elián's repatriation attracted international attention.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt; This is because Elián had become a &quot;symbol to many exiles&quot; reminding them of the solidarity of the Cuban exile community and its privileged status with economic refugee criteria. &lt;ref name=Cova/&gt;{{rp|153}} While Elián escaped both Cuba and death, he soon entered custody battles waged by his father, Miami relatives, and state actors from the U.S. and Cuba.

The international tug of war waged between the Cuban and American actors can be understood through the agendas of Fidel Castro; the Cuban American actor Lazaro Gonzalez representing the Miami relatives and the Miami Cuban expat community; and the U.S. government representative, Attorney General Janet Reno. In the case of Fidel Castro, he sought to showcase his power by first issuing an ultimatum to the U.S. that the boy should be returned to his father within 72 hours.&lt;ref name=Cova/&gt;

On January 10, 2000, a Florida state court had ruled that the Florida family court was able to decide the merit of motion related with temporary custody by Lazaro Gonzalez, stating that Elián should stay with the Miami relatives until a further custody hearing.&lt;ref name=France-Presse&gt;{{cite web |last1=France-Presse |first1=Agence |title=The Elian Gonzalez case: Chronology; Custody Tug of War Over Cuban Boy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/14/us/the-elian-gonzalez-case-chronology-custody-tug-of-war-over-cuban-boy.html |website=The New York Times |date=April 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Reno declared that the federal courts are responsible for deciding this case, and that the Miami relatives must appeal to the federal court.&lt;ref name=France-Presse/&gt; Here, the objective of Reno was to provide the relatives with a chance to provide &quot;any information&quot; they could that would be &quot;relevant in the decision&quot;.&lt;ref name=conference/&gt; She again emphasized that the INS commissioner had declared that the father speaks for the son, and that his wishes were to have his son returned to him.&lt;ref name=conference&gt;{{cite web |title=Reno Press Conference (2000) |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4587358/reno-press-conference |website= c-span.org |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Elián González was born December 6, 1993, to divorced parents.&lt;ref name= biography.com /&gt;
===Journey to Florida===
[[File:Elián González's journey, 2000.jpg|thumb|400px|The journey from [[Cárdenas, Cuba]] to Florida]]
On November 21, 1999, González, his mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez, and twelve others left Cuba on a small aluminum boat with a faulty engine; González's mother and ten others died in the crossing. González and the other two survivors floated at sea until they were rescued by two fishermen, who handed them over to the [[U.S. Coast Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Plemming&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y00/mar00/27e4.htm |title=Cuban boy draws picture of shipwreck drama | first= Sue |last= Plemming |date=March 27, 2000 |publisher=cubanet.org, quoting a Fox News article |access-date=October 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090112215621/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y00/mar00/27e4.htm |archive-date= January 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

González's cousin Marisleysis said that the boat's motor broke down and they tried in vain to bail out the water with nylon bags, but a storm doomed their efforts. He told her he tried to help get the water out and his mother's boyfriend placed him in an inner tube for safety. &quot;He said afterwards that he fell asleep and that when he woke up he never saw his mother again&quot;. He said, &quot;I think she drowned too because she didn't know how to swim&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Plemming&quot;/&gt;

Nivaldo Fernández Ferran, one of the three survivors on the boat, said &quot;Elizabeth protected her son to the end&quot;. According to Ferran, they set out on their trip at 4&amp;nbsp;am, dragging inflated rubber floats, or inner tubes, in case they needed them. As they encountered bad weather, the boat's engine failed and the craft began to fill with water. After it went under, the passengers clung to the inner tubes in cold water, with waves reaching heights of three to four meters (10 to 13 feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_6_16/ai_59585370/ |title=A Love Supreme |first= Diana |last= Ray |date=February 14, 2000 |publisher= BNET, quoting insightmag.com |access-date=October 6, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) released González to his paternal great-uncle, Lázaro. According to the ''Washington Post'', González's father, Juan Miguel González Quintana, had telephoned Lázaro from Cuba on November 22, 1999, to advise that González and his mother had left Cuba without Juan Miguel's knowledge, and to watch for their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 6, 2000 |title=The Politics of Elian |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB95497703886404 |access-date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

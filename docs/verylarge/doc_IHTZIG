An '''eared seal''' or '''otariid''' or '''otary''' is any member of the [[marine mammal]] family '''Otariidae''', one of three groupings of [[pinnipeds]]. They comprise 15 [[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]] in seven [[genus|genera]] (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as [[sea lion]]s or [[fur seal]]s, distinct from [[true seals]] (phocids) and the [[walrus]] (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the [[Pacific]] and [[Southern Oceans]] and the southern [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Atlantic]] Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.

The words 'otariid' and 'otary' come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{transl|grc|otarion}}'' meaning &quot;little ear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Otary, n., etymology of&quot; The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. http://dictionary.oed.com/ Accessed November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the small but visible external ear flaps ([[pinnae]]), which distinguishes them from the [[Phocidae|phocids]].

Along with the [[Phocidae]] and [[Odobenidae]], the two other members of Pinnipedia, Otаriidae are descended from a [[Enaliarctos|common ancestor]] most closely related to modern [[bear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lento, G.M. |author2=Hickson, R.E. |author3=Chambers, G.K. |author4=Penny, D. | date=1 January 1995| url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/12/1/28 | title = Use of spectral analysis to test hypotheses on the origin of pinnipeds | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–52 | pmid = 7877495 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040189| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate remains as to whether the phocids diverged from the otariids before or after the walrus.

Otariids arose in the [[Miocene]] (15-17 million years ago) in the North Pacific, diversifying rapidly into the Southern Hemisphere, where most species now live. The earliest known fossil {{sic|osariid}} is ''[[Eotaria crypta]]'' from southern California,&lt;ref name=eotaria&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0835| pmid = 25672999| title = The oldest known fur seal| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 20140835| year = 2015| last1 = Boessenecker | first1 = R. W.| last2 = Churchill | first2 = M.| pmc = 4360102}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the genus ''Callorhinus'' ([[northern fur seal]]) has the oldest fossil record of any living otariid, extending to the middle Pliocene. It probably arose from the extinct fur seal genus ''[[Thalassoleon]]''.

Traditionally, otariids had been subdivided into the fur seal (Arctocephalinae) and sea lion (Otariinae) subfamilies, with the major distinction between them being the presence of a thick underfur layer in the former. Under this categorization, the fur seals comprised two genera: ''Callorhinus'' in the North Pacific with a single representative, the northern fur seal (''C. ursinus''), and eight species in the Southern Hemisphere under the genus ''Arctocephalus''; while the sea lions comprise five species under five genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = J.E.

In light of this evidence, the subfamily separation has been removed entirely and the family Otariidae has been organized into seven genera with 16 species and two subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner, S. | year = 2003 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=198243 | title = Fur seals and sea lions (Otariidae): identification of species and taxonomic review | journal = Systematics and Biodiversity | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 339–439 | doi = 10.1017/S147720000300121X| s2cid = 86375627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS |id=180615 |taxon=Otariidae |accessdate=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonetheless, because of morphological and behavioral similarities among the &quot;fur seals&quot; and &quot;sea lions&quot;, these remain useful categories when discussing differences between groups of species. Compared to sea lions, fur seals are generally smaller, exhibit greater [[sexual dimorphism]], eat smaller prey and go on longer foraging trips; and, of course, there is the contrast between the coarse short sea lion hair and the fur seal's fur.

==Anatomy and appearance==
[[Image:Sea lion family.JPG|right|thumb|[[California sea lion]]s]]&lt;!-- I think that this picture is of a family, but I'm not sure, so I didn't want to be too bold! --&gt;
[[File:Ohrenrobbe vor der Küste Namibias.jpg|thumb|Eared seal off the Namibian coast.]]
Otariids have proportionately much larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles than phocids, and have the ability to turn their hind limbs forward and walk on all fours, making them far more maneuverable on land. They are generally considered to be less adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, since they breed primarily on land and haul out more frequently than true seals. However, they can attain higher bursts of speed and have greater maneuverability in the water. Their swimming power derives from the use of flippers more so than the sinuous whole-body movements typical of phocids and walruses.

Otariids are further distinguished by a more dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, and the aforementioned visible external pinnae. Their postcanine teeth are generally simple and conical in shape. The [[dentition|dental formula]] for eared seals is: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.1-3|lower=2.1.4.1}}. Sea lions are covered with coarse guard hairs, while fur seals have a thick underfur, which has historically made them the objects of commercial [[seal hunting|exploitation]].

Male otariids range in size from the 70-kg (150-lb) [[Galápagos fur seal]], smallest of all pinnipeds, to the over 1,000-kg (2,200-lb) [[Steller sea lion]]. Mature male otariids weigh two to six times as much as females, with proportionately larger heads, necks, and chests, making them the most [[sexually dimorphic]] of all mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Weckerly |first= FW |year= 1998 |title=Sexual-size dimorphism: influence of mass and mating systems in the most dimorphic mammals. |journal= Journal of Mammalogy|volume=79 |issue= 1|pages=33–42|doi=10.2307/1382840 |jstor= 1382840|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
All otariids breed on land during well-defined breeding seasons. Except for the [[Australian sea lion]], which has an atypical 17.5 month breeding cycle, they form strictly annual aggregations on beaches or rocky substrates, often on islands. All species are [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]]; i.e. successful males breed with several females. In most species, males arrive at breeding sites first and establish and maintain territories through vocal and visual displays and occasional fighting. Females typically arrive on shore a day or so before giving birth. While considered social animals, no permanent hierarchies or statuses are established on the colonies. The extent to which males control females or territories varies between species. Thus, the northern fur seal and the [[South American sea lion]] tend to herd specific [[Harem (zoology)|harem]]-associated females, occasionally injuring them, while the Steller sea lion and the [[New Zealand sea lion]] control spatial territories, but do not generally interfere with the movement of the females.

Otariids are carnivorous, feeding on [[fish]], [[squid]] and [[krill]]. Sea lions tend to feed closer to shore in [[upwelling]] zones, feeding on larger fish, while the smaller fur seals tend to take longer, offshore foraging trips and can subsist on large numbers of smaller prey items. They are visual feeders. Some females are capable of dives of up to 400&amp;nbsp;m (1,300&amp;nbsp;ft).

Although the two subfamilies of otariids, the Otariinae (sea lions) and Arctocephalinae (fur seals), are still widely used, recent molecular studies have demonstrated that they may be invalid.&lt;ref name=Yonezawa2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yonezawa, T. | year = 2009 | title = The monophyletic origin of sea lions and fur seals (Carnivora; Otariidae) in the Southern Hemisphere | journal = Gene | volume = 441 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 89–99 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2009.01.022 | pmid=19254754|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnason2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arnason, U. | year = 2006 | title = Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–354 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.022 | pmid=16815048|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they suggest three [[clade]]s within the family; one consisting of the northern sea lions (''Eumetopias'' and ''Zalophus''), one of the northern fur seal (''Callorhinus'') and its extinct relatives, and the third of all the remaining Southern Hemisphere species.&lt;ref name=Berta2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berta, A.  |author2=Churchill, M. | year = 2012 | title = Pinniped Taxonomy: evidence for species and subspecies | journal = Mammal Review | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–234 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00193.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the Second World War the town was damaged by air strikes of the Allies{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pardubice.rozhlas.cz/pardubice-si-nalety-z-roku-1944-stale-pamatuji-8018883|title=Pardubice si nálety z roku 1944 stále pamatují|website=Český rozhlas|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fanto Werke refinery at Pardubice was repeatedly bombed during the [[Oil Campaign chronology of World War II|Oil Campaign of World War II]], and [[forced labor]] was provided by a [[concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cestiromove.ecn.cz/id118.htm |title=archive |publisher=Cestiromove.ecn.cz |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/begdv_6/anlage_6.html |title=6.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nl|frɑns ˈɦɑls|lang}}; {{circa|1582}} – 26 August 1666) was a [[Dutch Golden Age painter]], normally of portraits, who lived and worked in [[Haarlem]].

Hals played an important role in the evolution of 17th-century group [[Portrait painting|portraiture]]. He is known for his loose [[painterly]] brushwork.

==Biography==
Hals was born in 1582 or 1583 in [[Antwerp]], then in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], as the son of cloth merchant Franchois Fransz Hals van Mechelen ({{circa|lk=no}} 1542–1610) and his second wife Adriaentje van Geertenryck.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150513075730/https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/35550 Frans Hals] iat the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{in lang|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like many, Hals' parents fled during&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/hals/hd_hals.htm|title=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|last=Liedtke|first=Walter|date=August 2011|website=metmuseum.org|url-status=live|access-date=29 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fall of Antwerp]] (1584–1585) from the south to Haarlem in the new [[Dutch Republic]] in the north, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Hals studied under [[Flemish people|Flemish]] émigré [[Karel van Mander]],&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour, Frans Hals, and P. Biesboer (1989). ''Frans Hals''. Munich: Prestel. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] influence, however, is barely noticeable in Hals' work.

In 1610, Hals became a member of the [[Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke]], and he started to earn money as an art restorer for the city council. He worked on their large art collection that Karel van Mander had described in his ''[[Schilderboeck]]'' (&quot;Painter's Book&quot;) published in Haarlem in 1604. The most notable of these were the works of [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]], [[Jan van Scorel]], and [[Jan Mostaert]] that hung in the [[Janskerk (Haarlem)|St John's Church]] in Haarlem. The restoration work was paid for by the city of Haarlem, since all Catholic religious art had been confiscated after the [[satisfactie van Haarlem]] had been reversed in 1578, which had formerly given Catholics equal rights to Protestants. However, the entire collection of paintings was not formally possessed by the city council until 1625, after the city fathers had decided which paintings were suitable for the city hall. The remaining art that was considered too &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; was sold to [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]], a fellow guild member, on the condition that he remove it from the city. It was in this cultural context that Hals began his career in portraiture, since the market had disappeared for religious themes.

The earliest known example of Hals' art is the portrait of ''[[Jacobus Zaffius]]'' (1611). His 'breakthrough' came with the life-sized group portrait ''[[The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616]]''. His most noted portrait today is the one of ''[[René Descartes]]'' which he made in 1649.

[[File:Frans-hals-standbeeld-florapark.JPG|thumb|Statue of Frans Hals in Florapark, Haarlem]]

Frans Hals married his first wife Anneke Harmensdochter around 1610. Frans was of Catholic birth, however, so their marriage was recorded in the city hall and not in church.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJVH&quot;&gt;[http://nha.courant.nu/issue/JJVH/1973-01-01/edition/null/page/251 Anneke Harmensdr] in ''Nieuwe gegevens betreffende Anneke Harmansdr., de eerste echtegonte van Frans Hals'', by M. Thierry de Bye Dolleman working from research by C.A. de Goederen-van Hees, pp. 249-257, Haerlem : jaarboek 1973, ISSN 0927-0728, on the website of the North Holland Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the exact date is unknown because the older marriage records of the Haarlem city hall before 1688 have not been preserved.&lt;ref name=JJVH/&gt; Anneke was born 2 January 1590 as the daughter of bleacher Harmen Dircksz and Pietertje Claesdr Ghijblant, and her maternal grandfather, linen producer Claes Ghijblant of [[:File:Haarlem - Spaarne 42.JPG|Spaarne 42]], bequeathed the couple the grave in [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem|St Bavo's Church (Grote Kerk)]] where both are buried, though Frans took over 40 years to join his first wife there.&lt;ref name=JJVH/&gt; Anneke died in 1615, shortly after the birth of their third child and, of the three, [[Harmen Hals|Harmen]] survived infancy and one had died before Hals' second marriage.&lt;ref name=JJVH/&gt; As biographer [[Seymour Slive]] has pointed out, older stories of Hals abusing his first wife were confused with another Haarlem resident of the same name. Indeed, at the time of these charges, the artist had no wife to mistreat, as Anneke had died in May 1615.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour, Frans Hals, and [[Pieter Biesboer]] (1989). ''Frans Hals''. Munich: Prestel. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historical accounts of Hals' propensity for drink have been largely based on embellished anecdotes of his early biographers, namely [[Arnold Houbraken]], with no direct evidence existing documenting such. After his first wife died, Hals took on the young daughter of a fishmonger to look after his children and, in 1617, he married Lysbeth Reyniers. They married in [[Spaarndam]], a small village outside the [[banns]] of Haarlem, because she was already 8 months pregnant. Hals was a devoted father, and they went on to have eight children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/index1.html see Hals biography] in the Web Gallery of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaries such as [[Rembrandt]] moved their households according to the caprices of their patrons, but Hals remained in Haarlem and insisted that his customers come to him. According to the Haarlem archives, a [[Meagre Company|schutterstuk]] that Hals started in Amsterdam was finished by [[Pieter Codde]] because Hals refused to paint in Amsterdam, insisting that the militiamen come to Haarlem to sit for their portraits. For this reason, we can be sure that all sitters were either from Haarlem or were visiting Haarlem when they had their portraits made.

Hals' work was in demand through much of his life, but he lived so long that he eventually went out of style as a painter and experienced financial difficulties. In addition to his painting, he worked as a [[art restoration|restorer]], art dealer, and art tax expert for the city councilors. His creditors took him to court several times, and he sold his belongings to settle his debt with a baker in 1652. The inventory of the property seized mentions only three [[mattress]]es and bolsters, an armoire, a table, and five pictures&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (these were by himself, his sons, van Mander, and [[Maarten van Heemskerck]]).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour, Frans Hals, and P. Biesboer (1989). ''Frans Hals''. Munich: Prestel. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Left destitute, he was given an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of 200 florins in 1664 by the municipality.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

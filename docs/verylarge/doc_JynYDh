''Dark Angel'' was set in Seattle, and filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], at [[Lions Gate Studios]].

===Unproduced season===
In the DVD commentary for &quot;Freak Nation&quot;, the series finale, Charles H. Eglee explained what had been planned for season three. The intention was to bring together the storylines of seasons one (&quot;Manticore&quot;) and two (&quot;Breeding Cult&quot;) and reveal the mythology of ''Dark Angel''. The season would reveal that thousands of years ago, Earth passed through a comet's tail which deposited viral material that killed 97% of the human race. The breeding cult preserved the survivors' genetic immunity so that when the comet returned, only members of the cult would survive. Sandeman, a cult member, and Max's creator betrayed the cult and decided to give this genetic immunity to the rest of humanity through Max, who would be the savior of the human race. There were multiple ideas on how to spread Max's immunity, including an air burst that would disperse the antibody through the atmosphere, or attaching the immunity to a [[common cold]] virus (Eglee detailed how a scene would show Original Cindy sneezing as part of the beginning of the immunity spread).&lt;ref name=commentary&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Charles H. Eglee]] (writer) |date=October 21, 2003 |title=Dark Angel: The Complete Second Season – &quot;Freak Nation&quot; audio commentary |publisher=20th Century Fox |medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  storyline is expanded upon in the final ''Dark Angel'' novel ''After the Dark'' though when the comet returns nobody falls ill, and it is believed that the cult simply had a false prediction.{{sfn|Collins|2003|pages=246–247}}

===Broadcast history===

The first season premiered in the United States on Tuesday, October 3, 2000, from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm. Fox had to obtain agreements from its affiliates to broadcast past 10:00 pm, as most of them air local news programs at this time.&lt;ref name=storm&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626111712/http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-01/entertainment/25585350_1_charles-eglee-dark-angel-dodges-bullets |archive-date=June 26, 2015 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-01/entertainment/25585350_1_charles-eglee-dark-angel-dodges-bullets |title=Actress Lights Up Screen In Fox's 'Dark Angel' |last=Storm |first=Jonathon |date=October 1, 2000 |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent weeks the show aired from 9:00 pm till 10:00 pm Tuesdays. During its first season, the show was preempted on several occasions, including by the [[2000 World Series]], the [[Billboard Music Awards]] and coverage of the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]]. The frequent preemptions became a running joke on the set.{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=244}} ''Dark Angel's'' scheduled air time put it in direct competition with ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' on [[The WB]]. Critics debated which of the similarly named shows would dominate the time-slot.{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=52}} Jonathon Storm from ''[[Philadelphia Media Network]]'' believed that ''Dark Angel'' would prove victorious,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; while Brad Adgate, a research director at ''Horizon Media'', predicted that ''Dark Angel'' would only initially take the lead in the ratings, as ''Angel's'' strong fanbase would prevail in the long run.&lt;ref name=sandra/&gt; Brad Turrell, executive vice-president of Network Communication for the ''WB'' conceded that the heavy promotion for ''Dark Angel'' would give it higher initial ratings at first but believed that as ''Angel'' was a &quot;better show&quot; it would not be affected long-term. Concerned that there might be confusion between the two shows, the ''WB'' took out a full page ad in ''[[TV Guide]]'', which read &quot;There is only ONE. [[David Boreanaz]] is ANGEL.&quot;&lt;ref name=sandra/&gt; ''Angel'' won the time slot when Fox moved the broadcast time of ''Dark Angel'' to 8:00 pm on Fridays for its second season,{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=52}} where it preceded the new series ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713175852/http://www.popmatters.com/review/pasadena/ |archive-date=July 13, 2015 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/pasadena/ |title=Pasadena |last=Tucker |first=Sarah |work=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The [[film score|score]] for the ''Dark Angel'' pilot was composed and conducted by [[Joel McNeely]].{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=247}} The pilot score track &quot;Bicycle Ride&quot; was used in the end credits for the duration of the series. The pilot score was released in full as part of the original publicity press kit, titled ''Dark Angel: Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot''. The 37-track CD was for promotional use only and not for resale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Joel McNeely]] |year=2000 |title=Dark Angel: Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot |medium=CD}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNeely returned to score the entire series, making frequent use of &quot;grumbling [[timpani]] rolls, bass drum beats and shrill brass and violin crescendos that familiarly sketch the action arcs of the narrative.&quot;{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=188}} Traditional orchestral elements are integrated with innovative electronic sounds and female vocals to create a sense of Max's &quot;otherworldliness&quot;, &quot;haunting wind chimes, pseudo-Orientalist refrains and extenuated high-pitched eerie sounds&quot; evoke Max's super-human abilities, and &quot;driving hip hop bass beats with heavy percussive effects [and] high-pitched feedback and reverberation&quot; convey Max's struggles with violence and her memories of Manticore.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=190}} The theme song for the series was composed by [[Chuck D]] and [[Gary G-Wiz]].{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=61}} Both McNeely and G-Wiz cited ''Dark Angel'' as an opportunity to push sonic boundaries; G-Wiz stated that Eglee and music supervisor Randy Gerston kept calling him and telling him to make the theme song &quot;crazier&quot;. McNeely said scoring the series was &quot;like the difference between jazz and classical music. I'm a jazz player, so ''Dark Angel'' is as free form and as weird as we want to get.&quot;{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=188}}

A soundtrack album consisting of [[hip hop]] and R&amp;B songs was released on April 23, 2002, through [[Artemis Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; Eglee explained that he and Cameron began with the idea that they could do a &quot;hip hop youth ensemble thing&quot;, noting that &quot;hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [and] in the world&quot; and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of ''Dark Angel'' the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Reminiscent of another time and place&amp;nbsp;... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as [[Fort Apache (hostile place)|Fort Apache]]: a place that for [[White Americans|white America]], defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would come to be known as Hip Hop.&amp;nbsp;... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|pages=190–191}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|pages=190–191}} The album features predominately female hip hop and [[neo soul]] artists whose lyrics typically &quot;focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality.&quot;{{sfn|Butkus|2012|pages=193}} It peaked at No. 50 on the [[Top Independent Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017132122/http://www.allmusic.com/album/dark-angel-mw0000216856/awards |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dark-angel-mw0000216856/awards |title=Original TV Soundtrack: Dark Angel – Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=June 20, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Birchmeier of [[AllMusic]] gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it &quot;seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character&quot;. Birchmeier said many of the songs were &quot;quite impressive&quot; and that it &quot;exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630225322/http://www.allmusic.com/album/dark-angel-mw0000216856 |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dark-angel-mw0000216856 |title=Original TV Soundtrack: Dark Angel |last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=June 20, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Dark Angel'' is considered to be in the [[cyberpunk]] genre.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=179}}&lt;ref name=four/&gt; Writing in ''Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture'', Lorna Jowett considered ''Dark Angel'' to be a &quot;hybrid of science fiction, [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]], and [[Action fiction|action]]&quot; which incorporated forms and themes from all three genres. Jowett compared ''Dark Angel'' to the Gothic novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'', saying that Max's genetic engineering makes her a &quot;postmodern Frankenstein's monster, blurring boundaries between human and monster&quot;.{{sfn|Jowett|2005}} Kathleen McConnell in ''Gothic Studies'' also compared Max's unconventional conception to Frankenstein's monster, and cited several other Gothic themes in the series. She states that Max fits the model of a Gothic heroine who &quot;ostensibly appear[s] to be conforming to their accepted role within the [[patriarchy]] but who actually subvert the father's power at every possible occasion.&quot;{{sfn|McConnell|2002|page=178}} In her book ''Post-feminist Impasses in Popular Heroine Television'', Alison Horbury theorizes that ''Dark Angel'', along with the shows ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[La Femme Nikita]]'', and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' have themes of abduction, physical and symbolic [[rape]], motherlessness, and the discovery of a sister.{{sfn|Horbury|2015|page=212}}

Several academics have considered ''Dark Angel'' to be part of a wave of shows in the late 90s and early 2000s including ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', and ''La Femme Nikita'' that feature strong female characters.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=179}} Writing in ''Science Fiction Film &amp; Television'', Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered to be a &quot;distinctly millennial post-[[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] warrior.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=182}} She also felt that Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an [[African American]] lesbian, conveyed [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]. For example, Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=194}} McConnell and Jowett also cited Max as an example of female empowerment; Jowett considered Max to be the &quot;usual postmodern, [[postfeminism|postfeminist]] representation of the female action hero with [at least] a reversal or [at most] a mixture of traditional gender traits.&quot;{{sfn|McConnell|2002|page=180}}{{sfn|Jowett|2005}}

Butkus stated that ''Dark Angel'' repeatedly paid homage to the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Lydecker, the &quot;flawed antagonist&quot; of ''Dark Angel'' is said to be a transposition of [[Rick Deckard|Deckard]], the &quot;flawed hero&quot; of ''Blade Runner''. Alec McDowell/X5-494's love interest is named Rachel, believed to be a reference to the [[replicant]] [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], though in ''Dark Angel'' it is McDowell and not Rachel who is bio-engineered. His flashbacks of this traumatic relationship use piano music similar to that used in ''Blade Runner'' to denote memories and a desire for former times. Alec's genetic memory enhancements enable him, with only a few hours practice, to play a detailed piano piece by [[Frédéric Chopin]], the composer originally scripted for the scene in ''Blade Runner'' where Rachael inexplicably finds herself able to play the piano; both characters are considered to be pre-programmed by state forces to master superhuman skills.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=189}}

==Reception and legacy==
Initial reaction to the series and Max's character was mostly positive, with favorable reviews in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} Hal Boedeker of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' said: &quot;Television's newest warrior woman possesses skills worthy of [[Catwoman]], [[Xena]], [[Emma Peel]], and [[Wonder Woman]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716200807/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-10-03/lifestyle/0010030012_1_max-logan-cale-alba |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-10-03/lifestyle/0010030012_1_max-logan-cale-alba |title=Dazzling 'Dark Angel' |last=Boedecker |first=Hal |date=October 3, 2000 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |access-date=October 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Rosenberg]] said: &quot;If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet.&quot;{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} However [[Joyce Millman]] said Max was &quot;little more than lips and ass&quot; and considered the series to be an expensive [[Britney Spears]] music video.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' ran a negative review of the Pilot episode in October 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926020359/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0%2C%2C20132479%2C00.html |archive-date=September 26, 2015 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20132479,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Main: Tube |date=October 9, 2000 |work=People |access-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; though in December they listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the &quot;breakthrough&quot; performances of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923192256/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20133326%2C00.html |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20133326,00.html |title=Breakthroughs 2000 |date=December 25, 2000 |work=People |access-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode was behind only ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' as the most watched new show of the week, albeit in a week with fewer new shows because of the presidential debate coverage. Fox chose to debut ''Dark Angel'' instead of airing the [[United States presidential election debates, 2000#First Presidential Debate — October 3|first presidential debate]], a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised, saying: &quot;The people who watch the debates aren't the people who'll tune into ''Dark Angel'' anyway&quot;, though he predicted that the premiere's high ratings would not hold up as the show competed against more varied competition in subsequent weeks.&lt;ref name=sandra&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626160150/http://www.ew.com/article/2000/10/03/dark-angel-could-trounce-wbs-angel-first |archive-date=June 26, 2015 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2000/10/03/dark-angel-could-trounce-wbs-angel-first |title=''Dark Angel'' could trounce WB's ''Angel'' – at first |last=Angulo |first=Sandra P |date=October 3, 2000 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the tenth most popular show overall that week, attracting 17.4 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017133004/http://www.eonline.com/news/40578/premiere-week-ratings-everybody-loves-cbs |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/40578/premiere-week-ratings-everybody-loves-cbs |title=Premiere Week Ratings: Everybody Loves CBS? |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |date=October 10, 2000 |publisher=[[E!]] |access-date=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron said he did not know if the broadcast time change for the second season would have a positive or negative effect on the show's ratings, though R. D. Heldenfels of the ''[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]'' noted the [[Friday night death slot|poor ratings of Friday night television]], especially the low viewing rates among 18 to 24-year-olds, the age-group that ''Dark Angel'' was most popular with.&lt;ref name=heldenfels/&gt; The new time slot saw a ratings drop; for the 2001–02 season ''Dark Angel'' averaged 6 million viewers, ranking number 114 in the [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015225616/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-05-28-year-end-chart.htm |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-05-28-year-end-chart.htm |work=USA Today |title=How did your favorite show rate? |date=May 28, 2002 |access-date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the release of the second season, Cynthia Fuchs of ''[[PopMatters]]'' said the first season of ''Dark Angel'' was one of the &quot;few straight-up successes, a ratings hit among the coveted 'youth' demographic.&quot; She praised the series but clarified: &quot;I'm not getting carried away: Jim Cameron is not going to be making revolutionary art anytime soon.&quot;&lt;ref name=fuchs&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010041433/http://www.popmatters.com/review/dark-angel2/ |archive-date=October 10, 2015 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/dark-angel2/ |title=Dark Angel |last=Fuchs |first=Cynthia |work=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Sauter of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that &quot;for a while [she was] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717020500/http://www.ew.com/article/2003/05/23/dark-angel-complete-first-season |archive-date=July 17, 2015 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/05/23/dark-angel-complete-first-season |title=Dark Angel: The Complete First Season |last=Sauter |first=Michael |date=May 23, 2003 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elka Karl of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: &quot;While the dialogue sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy.&quot;&lt;ref name=elka/&gt; While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of ''[[TVOvermind]]'' labelled the second season &quot;silly&quot;, criticizing &quot;dumb stories&quot; like Max's dream episode &quot;Boo&quot;, the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716164256/http://www.tvovermind.com/dark-angel/dark-angels-first-season-better-second-244891 |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |url=http://www.tvovermind.com/dark-angel/dark-angels-first-season-better-second-244891 |title=Why Dark Angel's First Season Is Better Than Its Second |last=Dankievitch |first=Randy |date=November 21, 2014 |work=[[TVOvermind]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in his book ''The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television'', John Kenneth Muir said it was necessary for Cameron to set ''Dark Angel'' in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 &quot;offered little possibility for crime, squalor and other societal problems&quot;. While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show's downfall, Muir said that larger factors in ratings dropping were the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Enron scandal]], and the depletion of the U.S. government's surplus, which changed ''Dark Angel's'' &quot;futuristic vision of recession in a Third-World America&quot; from an interesting, far-fetched premise to a &quot;depressing reminder that things could still get worse&quot;.{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=246}}

A [[Dark Angel (video game)|video game of the same name]] based on the series was developed by [[Radical Entertainment]], published by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and released for [[PlayStation 2]] on November 18, 2002, and later on [[Xbox]]. Alba and Weatherly voiced their respective characters in the game. Development of the game started before the series was cancelled, and the game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. Brett Todd of [[GameSpot]] gave the game 3.8 out of 10, saying: &quot;Although it's impossible to say whether or not the developers' morale was affected by the cancellation of the series, this third-person action adventure plays like it was cranked out to fulfill a contract&quot; and concluded &quot;the development of this game probably should have been cancelled at the same time as the television series&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Todd |first=Brett |date=January 3, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018022307/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-angel-review/1900-2907908/ |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-angel-review/1900-2907908/ |title=Dark Angel Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke Ferris from [[Game Revolution]] gave the game a 'D+', saying that while fans of ''Dark Angel'' would enjoy it as it &quot;mirrors an episode of the show almost exactly&quot;, anybody else was likely to find it boring.&lt;ref name=ferris&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferris |first=Duke |date=January 2003 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-angel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220343/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-angel |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=live |title=Dark Angel Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |access-date=June 23, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After witnessing footage taken in Seattle of a man she believes to be one of her X5 siblings, Max moves from Los Angeles to Seattle, meeting Original Cindy and Kendra on the way, before finding employment at Jam Pony. Max eventually discovers the man in the footage is her brother Seth, who unbeknown to her has been working for Logan as a personal agent. Shortly after being reunited with him at the [[Space Needle]], Seth, who has been injured, commits suicide by falling from it to avoid being captured by Lydecker. Max begins returning to the Space Needle to think and &quot;to be with Seth&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2002}}
* ''Dark Angel: Skin Game'' (2003) immediately follows the events of &quot;Freak Nation&quot;, the final episode of season two, describing days in May 2021. ''Skin Game'' focuses on a killer terrorizing the streets of Seattle and the growing suspicion and evidence that the killer could be transgenic. As the killings escalate, the U.S. Army and National Guard prepare themselves for an invasion of Terminal City. Max uncovers that the killer is a [[shapeshifting]] transgenic named Kelpy, though he has been unwillingly given a drug by Ames White that is causing his psychosis. When Max reveals this information to the public through Eyes Only, Ames White goes into hiding, and the invasion of Terminal City is called off. When Kelpy takes on Logan's form he is killed by the virus Max carries which was designed to kill Logan.{{sfn|Collins|2003a}}
* ''Dark Angel: After the Dark'' (2003) follows ''Skin Game''. It is revealed that Max's virus is gone, the most likely explanation being that when the virus killed Kelpy it went dormant as it believed its mission to kill Logan was accomplished. However, Logan and Max's relationship is thrown into turmoil when he reveals that he inadvertently caused Seth's death by sending him on an assignment. Just as Max is ready to forgive him, Logan is kidnapped by Ames White and the breeding cult, who are preparing for the coming of a comet they believe will destroy everyone except cult-members and transgenics through depositing viral material into Earth's atmosphere. They are trying to kill Max as they believe she possesses a genetic code that will save ordinary humans from the comet's viral material. With the aid of a team of transgenics, Max eventually rescues Logan and destroys the headquarters of the breeding cult; Joshua kills Ames White. When the comet arrives, nobody falls ill, and it is believed the cult's prediction was false. Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell at the cult's headquarters. He promises to help her find her mother if she saves him, and she agrees. The book ends with Logan and Max finally consummating their relationship.{{sfn|Collins|2003}}

The companion book, ''Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier'', begins with a letter written by Logan Cale during the stand-off at Terminal City. It is addressed to Detective Matt Sung, a recurring character from the series who aides Logan, instructing him that the package he is sending him contains documents pertaining to the four most critical Eyes Only investigations. If he is killed by the potential invasion of Terminal City, Logan wants Sung to carry on the investigations. The rest of the book contains the documents relating to the four investigations.{{sfn|Stern|2003}}

{{Paleontology}}
'''Index fossils''' (also known as guide fossils or indicator fossils) are [[fossil]]s used to define and identify [[geologic column|geologic periods]] (or faunal stages). Index fossils must have a short vertical range, wide geographic distribution and rapid evolutionary trends. Another term, Zone fossil is used when the fossil have all the characters stated above except wide geographical distribution, they are limited to a zone and can't be used for correlations of strata. &lt;ref name=&quot;USGS_indexfossils&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/fossils.html Index Fossils], from the [[US Geological Survey]].

'''Spirit possession''' is the supposed control of a human body by [[spirit]]s, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[demon]]s or [[Deity|gods]]. The concept of spirit possession exists in many religions, including [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;new1&quot;&gt;Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Wicca]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n traditions. In a 1969 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, spirit possession beliefs were found to exist in 74 percent of a sample of 488 societies in all parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourguignon|first1=Erika|last2=Ucko|first2=Lenora|title=Cross-Cultural Study of Dissociational States|date=1969|publisher=The Ohio State University Research Foundation with National Institute of Mental Health grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the cultural context in which it is found, possession may be considered voluntary or involuntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. Within possession cults, the belief that one is possessed by spirits is more common among women than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kehoe &amp; Giletti 1981&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kehoe |first1=Alice B. |last2=Giletti |first2=Dody H. |title=Women's Preponderance in Possession Cults: The Calcium-Deficiency Hypothesis Extended |journal=American Anthropologist |date=September 1981 |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=549–561 |doi=10.1525/aa.1981.83.3.02a00030 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor2796794&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=I.

== Ancient Egyptians ==
According to [[Augustin Calmet]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Egyptians believed that when the spirit of an animal is separated from its body by violence, it does not go to a distance, but remains near it. It is the same with the soul of a man who has died a violent death; it remains near the body—nothing can make it go away; it is retained there by sympathy; several have been seen sighing near their bodies which were interred. The magicians abuse their power over such in their incantations; they force them to obey, when they are masters of the dead body, or even part of it. Frequent experience taught them that there is a secret virtue in the body, which draws towards it the spirit which has once inhabited it; wherefore those who wish to receive or become the receptacles of the spirits of such animals as know the future, eat the principle parts of them, as the hearts of crows, moles, or hawks. The spirit of these creatures enters into them at the moment they eat this food, and makes them give out oracles like divinities.''.&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porphyry, when consulted by Anebo, an Egyptian priest, if those who foretell the future and perform prodigies have more powerful souls, or whether they receive power from some strange spirit, replies that, according to appearance, all these things are done by means of certain evil spirits that are naturally knavish, and take all sorts of shapes, and do everything that one sees happen, whether good or evil; but that in the end they never lead men to what is truly good.''&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Gurage people=====
Among the [[Gurage people]] of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. Wiliam A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called ''awre''. This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists the victim may enter a trancelike stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shack |first1=William A. |title=Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia |journal=Man |date=1971 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=30–43 |doi=10.2307/2798425 |jstor=2798425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or ''sagwara'', is summoned. Once the sagwara has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, however, it is believed to allow the victim to form a relationship with the spirit. Nevertheless, the victim is subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of [[ensete]], butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the ensete ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men are due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the ''awre'' serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43&quot;/&gt;

=====Sidama people=====
The belief in spirit possession is part of their native culture of the [[Sidama people]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamer |first1=John |last2=Hamer |first2=Irene |title=Spirit Possession and Its Socio-Psychological Implications among the Sidamo of Southwest Ethiopia |journal=Ethnology |date=1966 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=392–408 |doi=10.2307/3772719 |jstor=3772719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{See also|Ufufunyane}}

=====Digo people=====
The [[Digo people]] of [[Kenya]] refer to the spirits that supposedly possess them as  ''shaitani''. These ''shaitani'' typically demand luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as a genuine condition and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, men sometimes suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gomm |first1=Roger |title=Bargaining from Weakness: Spirit Possession on the South Kenya Coast |journal=Man |date=1975 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=530–543 |doi=10.2307/2800131 |jstor=2800131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Giriama people=====
The [[Giriama people]] of coastal Kenya believe in spirit possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIntosh |first1=Janet |title=Reluctant Muslims: embodied hegemony and moral resistance in a Giriama spirit possession complex |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=March 2004 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=91–112 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2004.00181.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mayotte====
In [[Mayotte]], approximately 25 percent of the adult population, and five times as many women as men, enter trance states in which they are supposedly possessed by certain identifiable spirits who maintain stable and coherent identities from one possession to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lambek |first1=Michael |title=spirit possession/spirit succession: aspects of social continuity among Malagasy speakers in Mayotte |journal=American Ethnologist |date=November 1988 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=710–731 |doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.4.02a00070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

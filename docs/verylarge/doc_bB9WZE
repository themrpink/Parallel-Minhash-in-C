'''Caratacus''' ([[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] ''*Caratācos'', [[Middle Welsh]] ''Caratawc''; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Caradog''; [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Karadeg''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Καράτακος''; variants [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Caractacus'', Greek ''Καρτάκης'') was a 1st-century&amp;nbsp;AD [[British Iron Age|British]] [[chieftain]] of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe, who resisted the [[Roman conquest of Britain]].

Before the Roman invasion Caratacus is associated with the expansion of his tribe's territory. His apparent success led to Roman invasion, nominally in support of his defeated enemies. He resisted the Romans for almost a decade, mixing guerrilla warfare with [[pitched battle|set-piece battles]], but was unsuccessful in the latter. After his final defeat he fled to the territory of Queen [[Cartimandua]], who captured him and handed him over to the Romans. He was sentenced to death as a military prisoner, but made a speech before his execution that persuaded the Emperor [[Claudius]] to spare him.

The legendary [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] character [[Caradog ap Bran]] and the legendary British king [[Arvirargus]] may be based upon Caratacus. Caratacus's speech to Claudius has been a common subject in art.

==Name==
Caratacus's name appears as both ''Caratacus'' and ''Caractacus'' in manuscripts of Tacitus, and as ''Καράτακος'' and ''Καρτάκης'' in manuscripts of Dio. Older reference works tend to favour the spelling &quot;Caractacus&quot;, but modern scholars agree, based on [[historical linguistics]] and source criticism, that the original [[Common Brittonic]] form was ''*Karatākos'', pronounced {{IPA-cel|karaˈtaːkos|}}, cognate with [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Caradog'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Karadeg'', and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''Carthach'', meaning &quot;loving, beloved, dear; friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth H. Jackson]], &quot;Queen Boudicca?&quot;, ''Britannia'' 10 p. 255, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Claudian invasion===
Caratacus is named by [[Dio Cassius]] as a son of the Catuvellaunian king [[Cunobelinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], trans Earnest Cary, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19–22]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on coin distribution Caratacus appears to have been the protégé of his uncle [[Epaticcus]], who expanded Catuvellaunian power westwards most likely from his palace in Verulam the heartland of the Catuvellauni into the territory of the [[Atrebates]].&lt;ref&gt;John Creighton, ''Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain'', Cambridge University Press, 2000; [[Philip de Jersey]] (1996), ''Celtic Coinage in Britain'', Shire Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; After Epaticcus died in about AD&amp;nbsp;35, the Atrebates, under [[Verica]], regained some of their territory, but it appears Caratacus completed the conquest, as Dio tells us Verica was ousted, fled to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and appealed to the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Claudius]] for help. This was the excuse used by Claudius to launch his [[Roman conquest of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in the summer of 43. The invasion targeted Caratacus's stronghold of [[Camulodunon]] (modern [[Colchester]]), previously the seat of his father Cunobelinus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crummy 1997&quot;&gt;Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester – Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|1897719043}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Malcolm. (1981) Roman Britain; 55BC – 400AD. Published by Fontana Paperbacks ({{ISBN|0006337562}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunobelinus had died some time before the invasion. Caratacus and his brother [[Togodumnus]] led the initial defence of the country against [[Aulus Plautius]]'s four [[Roman legion|legions]], thought to have been around 40,000 men, primarily using [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics. They lost much of the south-east after being defeated in two crucial battles, the [[Battle of the Medway|Battle of the River Medway]] and [[River Thames]]. Togodumnus was killed (although John Hind argues that Dio was mistaken in reporting Togodumnus's death, that he was defeated but survived, and was later appointed by the Romans as a friendly king over a number of territories, becoming the loyal king referred to by Tacitus as Cogidubnus or [[Togidubnus]])&lt;ref&gt;J.

Their stronghold of Camulodunon was converted into the first Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in Britain, [[Colonia Victricensis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crummy 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crummy, Philip (1992) Colchester Archaeological Report 6: Excavations at Culver Street, the Gilberd School, and other sites in Colchester 1971–85.

Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|0-9503727-4-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to Rome===
We next hear of Caratacus in [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', leading the [[Silures]] and [[Ordovices]] of [[Wales in the Roman Era|Wales]] against Plautius's successor as [[Roman governors of Britain|governor]], [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.33 12:33–38]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 50, Scapula managed to [[Caratacus's last battle|defeat Caratacus]] in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory, capturing Caratacus's wife and daughter and receiving the surrender of his brothers. Caratacus himself escaped, and fled north to the lands of the [[Brigantes]] (modern [[Yorkshire]]) where the Brigantian queen, [[Cartimandua]], handed him over to the Romans in chains. This was one of the factors that led to two Brigantian revolts against Cartimandua and her Roman allies, once later in the 50s and once in 69, led by [[Venutius]], who had once been Cartimandua's husband. With the capture of Caratacus, much of southern Britain from the [[Humber]] to the [[Severn]] was pacified and garrisoned throughout the 50s.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Britain, Richard Dargie (2007), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends place Caratacus's last stand at either [[Caer Caradoc]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} near [[Church Stretton]] or [[Herefordshire Beacon|British Camp]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} in the [[Malvern Hills]], but the description of [[Tacitus]] makes either unlikely:

{{quote|[Caratacus] resorted to the ultimate hazard, adopting a place for battle so that entry, exit, everything would be unfavourable to us and for the better to his own men, with steep mountains all around, and, wherever a gentle access was possible, he strewed rocks in front in the manner of a rampart. And in front too there flowed a stream with an unsure ford, and companies of armed men had taken up position along the defences.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Annals'', translated by A. J. Woodman, 2004; see also [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.33 Church &amp; Brodribb's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the [[Severn]] is visible from British Camp, it is nowhere near it, so this battle must have taken place elsewhere. A number of locations have been suggested, including a site near [[Brampton Bryan]]. Bari Jones, in ''[[Archaeology Today]]'' in 1998, identified Blodwel Rocks at [[Llanymynech]] in [[Powys]] as representing a close fit with Tacitus's account.{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Captive in Rome===
After his capture, Caratacus was sent to Rome as a war prize, presumably to be killed after a [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]]. Although a captive, he was allowed to speak to the [[Roman senate]]. Tacitus records a version of his speech in which he says that his stubborn resistance made Rome's glory in defeating him all the greater:

{{quote|[[Image:Caractacus-Claudius-Birrell-Fuseli.jpeg|thumb|300px|Andrew Birrell (after [[Henry Fuseli]]), ''Caractacus at the Tribunal of Claudius at Rome'' (1792)]]
If the degree of my nobility and fortune had been matched by moderation in success, I would have come to this City as a friend rather than a captive, nor would you have disdained to receive with a treaty of peace one sprung from brilliant ancestors and commanding a great many nations. But my present lot, disfiguring as it is for me, is magnificent for you. I had horses, men, arms, and wealth: what wonder if I was unwilling to lose them? If you wish to command everyone, does it really follow that everyone should accept your slavery? If I were now being handed over as one who had surrendered immediately, neither my fortune nor your glory would have achieved brilliance. It is also true that in my case any reprisal will be followed by oblivion. On the other hand, if you preserve me safe and sound, I shall be an eternal example of your clemency.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Annals'', translated by A. J. Woodman, 2004; see also [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.37 Church &amp; Brodribb's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He made such an impression that he was pardoned and allowed to live in peace in Rome. After his liberation, according to Dio Cassius, Caratacus was so impressed by the city of Rome that he said &quot;And can you, then, who have got such possessions and so many of them, still covet our poor huts?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#33.3c Epitome of Book LXI, 33:3c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==

===Medieval Welsh traditions===
Caratacus's memory may have been preserved in medieval Welsh tradition. A [[Harleian Genealogies|genealogy in the Welsh Harleian MS 3859]] ({{circa|1100}}) includes the generations &quot;''Caratauc map Cinbelin map Teuhant''&quot;, corresponding, via established processes of language change, to &quot;Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, son of [[Tasciovanus]]&quot;, preserving the names of the three historical figures in correct relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Harleian MS 3859 Genealogies#15-16|''Harleian Genealogies'' 16]]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20040610042344/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/2444/specs/caratacus.htm The Heirs of Caratacus] – Caratacus and his relatives in medieval Welsh genealogies&lt;/ref&gt;

Caratacus does not appear in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (1136), although he appears to correspond to [[Arviragus]], the younger son of [[Kymbelinus]], who continues to resist the Roman invasion after the death of his older brother [[Guiderius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 4#12|4.12–16]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Welsh versions his name is Gweirydd, son of Cynfelyn, and his brother is called Gwydyr;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''The History of the Kings of Britain'', translated by [[Lewis Thorpe]], 1973; Peter Roberts (trans), ''The Chronicle of the Kings of Britain'', 1811&lt;/ref&gt; the name Arviragus is taken from a poem by [[Juvenal]].&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/juvenal/4.shtml 4.126–127]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caradog ap Bran|Caradog, son of Bran]], who appears in medieval Welsh literature, has also been identified with Caratacus, although nothing in the medieval legend corresponds except his name. He appears in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' as a son of [[Bran the Blessed]], who is left in charge of Britain while his father makes war in [[Ireland]], but is overthrown by [[Caswallawn]] (the historical [[Cassivellaunus]], who lived a century earlier than Caratacus).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mabinogion|The Mabinogion]]'': &quot;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/mab/mab22.htm Branwen, daughter of Llyr]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh Triads]] agree that he was Bran's son, and name two sons, Cawrdaf and Eudaf.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', University of Wales Press, 1963; Triads from the [http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/triads1.html Red Book of Hergest] and [http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/triads2.html Peniarth MS 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern traditions===
Caradog only began to be identified with Caratacus after the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus, and new material appeared based on this identification. An 18th-century tradition, popularised by the Welsh antiquarian and forger [[Iolo Morganwg]], credits Caradog, on his return from imprisonment in Rome, with the introduction of Christianity to Britain. Iolo also makes the legendary king [[Coel Hen]] a son of Caradog's son [[Saint Cyllin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Iolo Morganwg]], ''Triads of Britain'' [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#17|17]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#2|2]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#23|23]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#24|24]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#34|34]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#35|35]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#41|41]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#55|55]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#79|79]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#85|85]], [[Wikisource:Triads of Britain#91|91]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Williams Morgan]] claimed that a reference to Cyllin as a son of Caratacus was found in the family records of [[Iestyn ab Gwrgant]] and used this as evidence of the early entry of Christianity to Britain:  &quot;Cyllin ab Caradog, a wise and just king. In his days many of the Cymry embraced the faith in Christ through the teaching of the saints of Cor-Eurgain, and many godly men from the countries of Greece and Rome were in Cambria. He first of the Cymry gave infants names; for before, names were not given except to adults, and then from something characteristic in their bodies, minds, or manners.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan1861&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Williams Morgan|title=St. Paul in Britain; or, The origin of British as opposed to papal Christianity|url=https://archive.org/details/stpaulinbritain01morggoog|accessdate=8 August 2012|year=1861|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stpaulinbritain01morggoog/page/n173 161]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tradition, which has remained popular among [[British Israelism|British Israelites]] and others, makes Caratacus already a Christian before he came to Rome, Christianity having been brought to Britain by either [[Joseph of Arimathea]] or [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], and identifies a number of early Christians as his relatives.&lt;ref&gt;This article formerly made reference to a passage of Dio Cassius that described Caratacus as a &quot;barbarian Christian&quot;. This derived from a [[transcription error]] in the version of the Cary translation of Dio online on the [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html Lacus Curtius] website, which has now been corrected to read &quot;barbarian chieftain&quot; as per the print edition ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/61*.html#33.3c Dio 61.33.3c]). See also the [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10883 Foster translation] at [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg], which also reads &quot;barbarian chieftain&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

One is [[Pomponia Graecina]], wife of [[Aulus Plautius]], the conqueror of Britain, who as Tacitus relates, was accused of following a &quot;foreign superstition&quot;, which the tradition considers to be Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D32 13:32]&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus describes her as the &quot;wife of the Plautius who returned from Britain with an ovation&quot;, which led [[John Lingard]] (1771–1851) to conclude, in his ''History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church'', that she was British;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We are, indeed, told that history has preserved the names of two British females, Claudia and Pomponia Graecina, both of them Christians, and both living in the first century of our era.&quot; [[John Lingard|Lingard, John]], ''History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church'', 2nd. ed. Newcastle, Walker, 1810 Vol. I., p1.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this conclusion is a misinterpretation of what Tacitus wrote. An [[ovation]] was a military parade in honour of a victorious general, so the person who &quot;returned from Britain with an ovation&quot; is clearly Plautius, not Pomponia. This has not prevented the error being repeated and disseminated widely.

Another is [[Claudia Rufina]], a historical British woman known to the poet [[Martial]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martial]], ''Epigrams'', XI:53 (ed. &amp; trans. D. R. Shackleton Bailey, Harvard University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Martial describes Claudia's marriage to a man named Pudens,&lt;ref&gt;Martial, ''Epigrams'' IV:13&lt;/ref&gt; almost certainly [[Aulus Pudens]], an [[Umbria]]n [[centurion]] and friend of the poet who appears regularly in his ''Epigrams''. It has been argued since the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Baronius, ''Annales Ecclesiastici'', Antwerp, 1614; Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (1637), ''British Ecclesiastical Antiquities'', Oxford; Cardinal [[Michael Alford]] (1663), ''Annales Ecclesiae Britannicae: Regia Fides, Vol 1''; [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|Williams, J.]] (1848), contributor John Abraham, ''Claudia and Pudens'', Herauld&lt;/ref&gt; that this pair may be the same as the Claudia and Pudens mentioned as members of the Roman Christian community in ''[[Pastoral Epistles|2 Timothy]]'' in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pastoral Epistles|2 Timothy]]'' 4:21 – &quot;Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some go further, claiming that Claudia was Caratacus' daughter, and that the historical [[Pope Linus]], who is described as the &quot;brother of Claudia&quot; in an early church document, was Caratacus' son. Pudens is identified with [[Saint Pudens|St. Pudens]], and it is claimed that the basilica of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome, and with which St. Pudens is associated, was once called the ''Palatium Britannicum'' and was the home of Caratacus and his family.

This theory was popularised in a 1961 book called ''The Drama of the Lost Disciples'' by George Jowett, but Jowett did not originate it. He cites renaissance historians such as Archbishop [[James Ussher]], [[Caesar Baronius]] and [[John Hardyng]], as well as classical writers like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], although his classical citations at least are wildly inaccurate, many of his assertions are unsourced, and many of his identifications entirely speculative. He also regularly cites ''St. Paul in Britain'', an 1860 book by [[Richard Williams Morgan|R. W. Morgan]], and advocates other tenets of British Israelism, in particular that the British are descended from the [[Ten lost tribes|lost tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;George Jowett, ''The Drama of the Lost Disciples'', Covenant Books, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Ernest Jones''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRCP|MRCS}} (1 January 1879 – 11 February 1958) was a Welsh [[neurologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]]. A lifelong friend and colleague of [[Sigmund Freud]] from their first meeting in 1908, he became his official biographer. Jones was the first English-speaking practitioner of [[psychoanalysis]] and became its leading exponent in the English-speaking world. As President of both the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] and the [[British Psychoanalytical Society|British Psycho-Analytical Society]] in the 1920s and 1930s, Jones exercised a formative influence in the establishment of their organisations, institutions and publications.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=1}}

== Early life and career ==
Ernest Jones was born in [[Gowerton]] (formerly Ffosfelin), Wales, an industrial village on the outskirts of [[Swansea]], the first child of Thomas and Ann Jones. His father was a self-taught [[colliery]] engineer who went on to establish himself as a successful business man, becoming accountant and company secretary at the Elba Steelworks in Gowerton.  His mother, Mary Ann (née Lewis), was from a Welsh-speaking [[Carmarthenshire]] family which had relocated to Swansea.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=7–8}} Jones was educated at [[Bishop Gore School|Swansea Grammar School]], [[Llandovery College]], and [[Cardiff University]] in [[Wales]]. Jones studied at [[University College London]] and meanwhile he obtained the [[Conjoint]] diplomas [[Royal College of Physicians#Membership and fellowship|LRCP]] and [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] in 1900. A year later, in 1901, he obtained an [[Bachelor of Medicine|M.B.]] degree with honours in medicine and [[obstetrics]]. Within five years he received an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree and a [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] (MRCP) in 1903. He was particularly pleased to receive the University's gold medal in obstetrics from his distinguished fellow-Welshman, [[Sir John Williams, 1st Baronet, of the City of London|Sir John Williams]].{{sfn|Jones|1959|p=29}}

After obtaining his medical degrees, Jones specialised in [[neurology]] and took a number of posts in London hospitals. It was through his association with the surgeon [[Wilfred Trotter]] that Jones first heard of Freud's work. Having worked together as surgeons at [[University College Hospital]], he and Trotter became close friends, with Trotter taking the role of mentor and confidant to his younger colleague. They had in common a wide-ranging interest in philosophy and literature, as well as a growing interest in Continental psychiatric literature and the new forms of clinical therapy it surveyed. By 1905 they were sharing accommodation above [[Harley Street]] consulting rooms with Jones's sister, Elizabeth, installed as housekeeper. Trotter and Elizabeth Jones later married.  Appalled by the treatment of the mentally ill in institutions, Jones began experimenting with hypnotic techniques in his clinical work.{{sfn|Jones|1959|pp=123–124}}

Jones first encountered Freud's writings directly in 1905, in a German psychiatric journal in which Freud published the famous [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] case-history. It was thus he formed &quot;the deep impression of there being a man in Vienna who actually listened with attention to every word his patients said to him...a revolutionary difference from the attitude of previous physicians...&quot;{{sfnm |1a1=Brome |1y=1982 |1pp=45–46 |2a1=Jones |2y=1959 |2p=159}}

Jones's early attempts to combine his interest in Freud's ideas with his clinical work with children resulted in adverse effects on his career. In 1906 he was arrested and charged with two counts of indecent assault on two adolescent girls whom he had interviewed in his capacity as an inspector of schools for &quot;mentally defective&quot; children. At the court hearing Jones maintained his innocence, claiming the girls were fantasising about any inappropriate actions by him. The magistrate concluded that no jury would believe the testimony of such children and Jones was acquitted.{{efn|At that time, Jones was in a particularly turbulent mental state. Demoralised by his failure to secure a position appropriate to his outstanding qualifications, he was also powerfully sexually attracted to his then client, Loe Kann. Notwithstanding Jones's acquittal, his biographer Maddox suggests that Jones may have suffered a &quot;loss of self-restraint&quot; during his interviews of the adolescent girls.}}{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=41–47}} In 1908, employed as a pathologist at a London hospital, Jones accepted a colleague's challenge to demonstrate the repressed sexual memory underlying the hysterical paralysis of a young girl's arm. Jones duly obliged but, before conducting the interview, he omitted to inform the girl's consultant or arrange for a [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]]. Subsequently, he faced complaints from the girl's parents over the nature of the interview and he was forced to resign his hospital post.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=58–60}}

== Personal life ==

Jones's first serious relationship was with Loe Kann, a wealthy Dutch émigré referred to him in 1906 after she had become [[addiction|addicted]] to [[morphine]] during treatment for a serious kidney condition. Their relationship lasted until 1913. It ended with Kann in analysis with Freud and Jones, at Freud's behest, undergoing analysis with [[Sándor Ferenczi]].{{sfn|Jones|1959|pp=197–199}}

A tentative romance with Freud's daughter, [[Anna Freud|Anna]], did not survive the disapproval of her father. Before her visit to Britain in the autumn of 1914, which Jones chaperoned, Freud advised him: {{quote|She does not claim to be treated as a woman, being still far away from sexual longings and rather refusing man. There is an outspoken understanding between me and her that she should not consider marriage or the preliminaries before she gets 2 or 3 years older.{{sfn|Paskauskas|1993|p=294}}}}

In 1917 Jones married the Welsh musician [[Morfydd Llwyn Owen]]. They were holidaying in South Wales the following year when Morfydd became ill with acute [[appendicitis]]. Emergency surgery was carried out at her parents-in-law's Swansea home but the local surgeon who operated was unable to save her from the effects of [[chloroform]] poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M Wynn Thomas|title=In The Shadow of the Pulpit: Literature and Nonconformist Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3yvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|date=1 November 2010|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-2342-7|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was buried in [[Oystermouth Cemetery]] on the outskirts of Swansea where her gravestone bears the inscription, chosen by Jones from [[Goethe's Faust]], &quot;''Das Unbeschreibliche, hier ist's getan''&quot;.{{efn|The Goethe text translates as &quot;Here the indescribable is done.&quot;}}{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=140–141}}

Following some inspired matchmaking by his Viennese colleagues, in 1919 Jones met and married Katherine Jokl, a Jewish economics graduate from Moravia. She had been at school in Vienna with Freud's daughters. They had four children in what proved to be a long and happy marriage, though both struggled to overcome the loss of their eldest child, Gwenith, at the age of 7, during the interwar influenza epidemic.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=196–197}} Their son [[Mervyn Jones (writer)|Mervyn Jones]] became a writer.

== Psychoanalytical career ==
Whilst attending a congress of neurologists in Amsterdam in 1907, Jones met [[Carl Jung]], from whom he received a first-hand account of the work of Freud and his circle in Vienna. Confirmed in his judgement of the importance of Freud's work, Jones joined Jung in [[Zurich]] to plan the inaugural Psychoanalytical Congress. This was held in 1908 in [[Salzburg]], where Jones met Freud for the first time. Jones travelled to [[Vienna]] for further discussions with Freud and introductions to the members of the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]]. Thus began a personal and professional relationship which, to the acknowledged benefit of both, would survive the many dissensions and rivalries which marked the first decades of the psychoanalytic movement, and would last until Freud's death in 1939.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=60–62}}

With his career prospects in Britain in serious difficulty, Jones sought refuge in Canada in 1908. He took up  teaching duties in the Department of Psychiatry of the [[University of Toronto]] (from 1911, as Associate Professor of Psychiatry).  In addition to building a private psychoanalytic practice, he worked as pathologist to the Toronto Asylum and Director of its psychiatric outpatient clinic. Following further meetings with Freud in 1909 at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]], where Freud gave a series of lectures on psychoanalysis, and in the Netherlands the following year, Jones set about forging strong working relationships with the nascent American psychoanalytic movement. He gave some 20 papers or addresses to American professional societies at venues ranging from Boston, to Washington and Chicago. In 1910 he co-founded the American Psychopathological Association and the following year the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], serving as its first Secretary until 1913.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|p=94}}

Jones undertook an intensive programme of writing and research, which produced the first of what were to be many significant contributions to psychoanalytic literature, notably monographs on ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''On the Nightmare''. A number of these were published in German in the main psychoanalytic periodicals published in Vienna; these secured his status in [[Inner circle (psychoanalysis)|Freud's inner circle]] during the period of the latter's increasing estrangement from Jung. In this context in 1912 Jones initiated, with Freud's agreement, the formation of a Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement.{{efn|Apart from Freud and Jones, the 1912 Committee comprised [[Otto Rank]] and Hans Sachs (from Vienna), [[Karl Abraham]] (Berlin) and [[Sándor Ferenczi]] (Budapest). Later recruits were [[Max Eitingon]] (Berlin) and [[Anna Freud]]. The Committee continued to function until 1927.}} This development also served the more immediate purpose of isolating Jung and, with Jones in strategic control, eventually manoeuvring him out of the Presidency of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], a post he had held since its inception. When Jung's resignation came in 1914, it was only the outbreak of the Great War that prevented Jones from taking his place.{{sfn|Maddox|2006|pp=101–102, 113}}

Returning to London in 1913, Jones set up in practice as a psychoanalyst, founded the London Psychoanalytic Society, and continued to write and lecture on psychoanalytic theory. A collection of his papers was published as ''Papers on Psychoanalysis'', the first account of psychoanalytic theory and practice by a practising analyst in the English language.

By 1919, the year he founded the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]], Jones could report proudly to Freud that psychoanalysis in Britain &quot;stands in the forefront of medical, literary and psychological interest&quot; (letter 27 January 1919 (Paskauskas 1993)). As President of the Society – a post he would hold until 1944 – Jones secured funding for and supervised the establishment in London of a ''Clinic'' offering subsidised fees, and an Institute of Psychoanalysis, which provided administrative, publishing and training facilities for the growing network of professional psychoanalysts.

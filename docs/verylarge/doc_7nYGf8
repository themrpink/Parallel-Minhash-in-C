==Poetical works==
===First academic writings (1813–1816)===
[[File:Leopardi - Puerili e abbozzi vari, 1924 - 1859280 C.jpeg|thumb|upright|''Puerili e abbozzi vari'', a collection of Leopardi's early writings from 1809]]

These were rough years for Leopardi, as he started developing his concept of Nature. At first he saw this as &quot;benevolent&quot; to mankind, helping to distract people from their sufferings. Later, by 1819, his idea of Nature became dominated by a destructive mechanism. 

Up to 1815, Leopardi was essentially an erudite philologist. Only thereafter he began to dedicate himself to literature and the search for beauty, as he affirms in a famous letter to Giordani of 1817. ''Pompeo in Egitto'' (&quot;Pompey in Egypt&quot;, 1812), written at the age of fourteen, is an anti-Caesar manifesto. Pompey is seen as the defender of republican liberties. ''Storia dell'Astronomia'' (&quot;History of Astronomy&quot;, 1813) is a compilation of all of the knowledge accumulated in this field up to the time of Leopardi. From the same year is ''Saggio sopra gli errori popolari degli antichi'' (&quot;Essay on the popular errors of the ancients&quot;), which brings the ancient myths back to life. The &quot;errors&quot; are the fantastic and vague imaginings of the ancients. Antiquity, in Leopardi's vision, is the infancy of the human species, which sees the personifications of its myths and dreams in the stars.

The year 1815 saw the production of ''Orazione agli Italiani in Occasione della Liberazione del Piceno'' (&quot;Oration to the Italians on the liberation of Piceno&quot;), a paean to the 'liberation' achieved by Italy after the intervention of the Austrians against [[Joachim Murat|Murat]]. In the same year he translated ''[[Batrachomyomachia|Batracomiomachia]]'' (the war between the frogs and mice in which Zeus eventually sends in the crabs to exterminate them all), an ironic rhapsody which pokes fun at [[Homer]]'s ''Iliad'', once attributed to the epic poet himself.

In 1816 Leopardi published ''Discorso sopra la vita e le opere di Frontone'' (&quot;Discourse on the life and works of [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]]&quot;). In the same year, however, he entered a period of crisis. He wrote ''L'appressamento della morte'', a poem in ''terza rima'' in which the poet experiences death, which he believes to be imminent, as a comfort. Meanwhile, there began other physical sufferings and a serious degeneration of his eyesight. He was acutely aware of the contrast between the interior life of man and his incapacity to manifest it in his relations with others.

Leopardi abandoned his philological studies and moved increasingly toward poetry by reading Italian authors of the 14th, 16th and 17th centuries, as well as some of his Italian and French contemporaries. His vision of the world underwent a change: he ceased to seek comfort in religion, which had permeated his childhood, and became increasingly inclined toward an empirical and mechanistic vision of the universe inspired by [[John Locke]] among others.

In 1816 the idylls ''Le rimembranze'' and ''Inno a Nettuno'' (&quot;Hymn to Neptune&quot;) were published. The second, written in ancient Greek, was taken by many critics as an authentic Greek classic. He also translated the second book of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and the first book of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. In the same year, in a letter to the compilers of the ''Biblioteca Italiana'' ([[Vincenzo Monti|Monti]], [[Giuseppe Acerbi|Acerbi]], Giordani), Leopardi argued against [[Madame de Staël]]'s article inviting Italians to stop looking to the past, but instead study the works of foreigners, so as to reinvigorate their literature. Leopardi maintained that &quot;knowing&quot;, which is acceptable, is not the same thing as &quot;imitating&quot;, which is what Madame de Stael demanded, and that Italian literature should not allow itself to be contaminated by modern forms of literature, but look to the Greek and Latin classics. A poet must be original, not suffocated by study and imitation: only the first poet in the history of humanity could have been truly original, since he had had no one to influence him. It was therefore necessary to get as close to the originals as possible, by drawing inspiration from one's own feelings, without imitating anyone.

Thanks to his friendship with Giordani, with whom, in 1817, he had begun a prolific correspondence, his distancing from the [[conservatism]] of his father became even sharper. It was in the following year that he wrote ''All'Italia'' (&quot;To Italy&quot;) and ''Sopra il monumento di Dante'' (&quot;On the Monument of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]&quot;), two very polemical and classical [[patriotic]] hymns in which Leopardi expressed his adherence to [[Liberalism|liberal]] and strongly [[Secularity|secular]] ideas.

In the same period, he participated in the debate, which engulfed the literary Europe of the time, between the [[Classicism|classicists]] and the [[Romanticism|romanticists]], affirming his position in favour of the first in the ''Discorso di un Italiano attorno alla poesia romantica'' (&quot;Discourse of an Italian concerning romantic poetry&quot;).

In 1817 he fell in love with Gertrude Cassi Lazzari and wrote ''Memorie del primo amore'' (&quot;Memories of first love&quot;). In 1818 he published ''Il primo amore'' and began writing a diary which he would continue for fifteen years (1817–1832), the ''Zibaldone''.

===The first ''canti'' (1818)===
{{Main|Canti (Leopardi)}}
[[File:Versi del conte Giacomo Leopardi.djvu|thumb|right|First edition of ''Canti'' by Leopardi]]

''All'Italia'' and ''Sopra il monumento di Dante'' marked the beginning of the series of major works. In the two ''canti'', the concept of &quot;excessive&quot; or &quot;over-civilization&quot; which is deleterious for life and beauty first makes it appearance. In the poem ''All'Italia'', Leopardi laments the fallen at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] (480 BC, fought between the Greeks under [[Leonidas]] and the Persians under [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]), and evokes the greatness of the past. In the second ''canto'', he turns to [[Dante]] and asks from him pity for the pathetic state of his fatherland. In the great ''canti'' which follow (forty-one, including fragments), there is a gradual abandonment of the reminiscences, of literary allusions and of conventionalisms.

In 1819, the poet attempted to escape from his oppressive domestic situation, travelling to Rome. But he was caught by his father. In this period, his personal pessimism evolves into the peculiar [[philosophical pessimism]] of Leopardi. ''Le Rimembranze'' and ''L'appressamento della morte'' also belong to this early period of the art of Leopardi.

===The ''Idilli'' (1819–1821)===
The six ''Idilli'' (&quot;Idylls&quot;), namely ''Il sogno'' (&quot;The dream&quot;), ''L'Infinito'' (&quot;The Infinite&quot;), ''La sera del dì di festa'' (&quot;The evening of the feast day&quot;), ''Alla Luna'' (&quot;To the Moon&quot;), ''La vita solitaria'' (&quot;The solitary life&quot;) and ''Lo spavento notturno'' (&quot;Night-time terror&quot;), followed hard upon the first canti. ''Il sogno'' is still [[Petrarch]]esque, while the others which followed are the fruit of a more mature and independent art. Leopardi establishes with nature a sort of accord which attenuates the pain and discomfort.

In all of the idylls, the initial sparks, offered by memory or by the sweetness of nature, transmute their colors into the intuition of universal pain, of the transience of things, of the oppressive weight of eternity, of the inexorable passing of time, of the blind power of nature.

====''L'Infinito''====
[[File:Infinito.jpg|thumb|right|Original manuscript of ''L'Infinito'']]

{{original research inline|date=June 2013}} The highest expression of poetry is reached in Leopardi in ''[[L'Infinito (poem)|L'Infinito]]'', which is at once philosophy and art, since in the brief harmony of the verses are concentrated the conclusions of long philosophical meditations. The theme is a concept, which mind can only with extreme difficulty conceive. The poet narrates an experience he often has when he sits in a secluded place on a hill. His eyes cannot reach the horizon, because of a hedge surrounding the site; his thought, instead, is able to imagine spaces without limits: 

&lt;poem style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;&quot;Sempre caro mi fu quest'ermo colle,
E questa siepe, che da tanta parte
Dell'ultimo orizzonte il guardo esclude.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Another interpretation suggests that this hill represents the heights human thought achieves, but at the top there is a hedge that prevents one from seeing the ultimate horizon, beyond death and existence. Thus this hedge can be interpreted as signifying the limits of human understanding regarding human existence in the Universe. This is why the poem begins with &quot;Sempre caro mi fu&quot; which can be translated as &quot;It was always precious for me&quot;. The silence is deep; when a breath of wind comes, this voice sounds like the voice of present time, and by contrast it evokes all times past, and eternity. Thus, the poet's thought is overwhelmed by new and unknown suggestions, but &quot;il naufragar m'è dolce in questo mare&quot; (&quot;shipwreck / seems sweet to me in this sea.&quot; English translation by [[A. S. Kline]]).

===The ''Canzoni'' (1820–1823)===
Leopardi returns to the evocation of ancient eras and exhorts his contemporaries to seek in the writings of the classics the noble ancient virtues.

====''Ad Angelo Mai''====
In occasion of the discovery of the ''De Republica'' of [[Cicero]] on the part of [[Angelo Mai|Mai]], Leopardi wrote the poem ''Ad Angelo Mai'' (&quot;To Angelo Mai&quot;) in which he invokes the figures of many Italian poets, from [[Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] to [[Torquato Tasso]] whom he felt so near to himself, to his contemporary [[Vittorio Alfieri]].

====''Nelle nozze della sorella Paolina''====
In the lyrical ''Nelle nozze'' (&quot;On the marriage of my sister Paolina&quot;), an event that failed to happen, in the course of wishing happiness for his sister, the poet uses the opportunity to exalt the strength and the virtue of the women of antiquity and to denigrate his own time because it did not allow one to be virtuous and happy, since only after death are those who have lived a morally good life praised.

====''Ad un vincitor di pallone''====
The canto ''Ad un vincitor di pallone'' (&quot;To the winner of a game of football&quot;) expresses disdain for the tedium of a life that is nothing but a monotonous repetition of human affairs and to which only danger can restore value: only he who has been near the gates of death is able to find sweetness in life.

====''Bruto minore''====
In ''Bruto minore'' (&quot;Brutus the Younger&quot;), Brutus the assassin of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] is depicted as a man who has always believed in honor, virtue and liberty and who has ultimately sacrificed everything for these ideals. He has come to the realization, too late to change things, that everything was done in vain, that everything has been pointless, that he will even die dishonoured and disgraced for his well-intentioned actions.

His meditations bring him to the conclusion that morality is meaningless; [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] rewards only the selfish and plays arbitrary games with hapless mankind. Man is more unhappy than the rest of the animal kingdom because the latter do not know that they are unhappy and therefore do not meditate on the question of suicide and, even if they could, nothing would prevent them from carrying out the act without hesitation.

====''Ultimo canto di Saffo''====
[[File:Bust Sappho Musei Capitolini MC1164.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Sappho]]]]

[[Sappho]] is also a tragic figure. In fact, she is a great and generous spirit, an exceptional mind and a sublime character trapped in a miserable body. Sappho loved the light (the loved one, according to the legend, was named [[Phaon]], in Greek Φάων, from φῶς, light) but her life was made of shadow; she loved nature and beauty, but nature has been like an evil stepmother to her and she, who is sensitive, cultured and refined, is closed in the prison of a deformed body. Nor can the greatness of her genius help to release her from this horror.

In Sappho, Leopardi sees himself retarded, but in reality the poet of Lesbos was neither deformed nor unhappy as she is depicted by Leopardi, who based his depiction on a false traditional belief. Sappho knew, tasted, and sang of beauty and love more than was possible for Leopardi. But the resignation to unhappiness, to pain and to solitude, and the renunciation of the joys of life, sounds in the verses of Leopardi like the sincere sigh of a feminine soul.

The canto begins as a sweet apostrophe to the placid nights, once dear to the serene poet, but the words turn rapidly to a violent evocation of nature in tempest which echoes her inner turmoil. The anguishing and accusative questions which Leopardi poses to a destiny which has denied beauty to the miserable Sappho are cut short by the thought of death. After having wished to the man she has loved in vain that little bit of happiness which is possible to attain on this earth, Sappho concludes by affirming that of all the hopes for joy, of all the illusions, there remains to await her only [[Tartarus]].

====''Alla primavera'' and ''Al conte Carlo Pepoli''====
The canti ''Alla primavera'' (&quot;To Spring&quot;) and ''Al conte Carlo Pepoli'' (&quot;To Count [[Carlo Pepoli]]&quot;) emerge from the same spiritual situation. The first laments the fall of the great illusions (&quot;gli ameni inganni&quot;) and the imaginary mythological worlds of the past, which embellished and enriched the fantasy of man. The second decries the loss of happiness that has resulted.

In ''Alla primavera'', Leopardi praises the ancient times when the nymphs populated the fields, the woods, the springs, the flowers and the trees. Although the lyrical style is apparently classical, it is also pervaded by the characteristic dissatisfaction with the present of the romantics. Leopardi, here, romanticizes the pure intentions of the Greeks, since he was actually romantic in his sentiments and classical in his imagination and intellect.

In the ''Epistolario a Carlo Pepoli'', Leopardi attempts to prove to his friend the thesis (reminiscent of Buddhism) according to which, since life has no other aim but happiness and since happiness is unattainable, all of life is nothing but an interminable struggle. But he who refuses to work is oppressed by the tedium of life and must seek distraction in useless pastimes. Moreover, those who dedicate themselves to poetry, if they have no fatherland, are tormented more than those who do by a lack of freedom because they fully appreciate the value of the idea of nationhood.

At this point, a disillusioned Leopardi considers abandoning poetry for philosophy, but without any hope of glory. He has resigned himself to the certainty of pain and of boredom to which mankind is condemned and he therefore believes it necessary to abandon the illusions and poetry in order to speculate on the laws and destiny of the universe.

====''Alla sua donna''====
In 1823, he wrote the canto ''Alla sua donna'' (&quot;To his woman&quot;), in which he expresses his ardent aspiration for a feminine ideal which, with love, might render life beautiful and desirable. During his youth, he had dreamt in vain of encountering a woman who embodied such a feminine ideal: a platonic idea, perfect, untouchable, pure, incorporeal, evanescent, and illusory.

It is a hymn not to one of Leopardi's many &quot;loves,&quot; but to the discovery that he had unexpectedly made—at that summit of his life from which he would later decline—that what he had been seeking in the lady he loved was &quot;something&quot; beyond her, that was made visible in her, that communicated itself through her, but was beyond her. This beautiful hymn to Woman ends with this passionate invocation:

[[File:Leopardi Opere Napoli 1835.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Cover of the ''[[Small Moral Works|Operette morali]]'' in the last edition of Leopardi's ''Works'' in his lifetime, Naples 1835]]

===''Operette morali'' (1824)===
{{Main|Small Moral Works}}
Between the years 1823 and 1828, Leopardi set aside lyric poetry in order to compose his prose magnum opus, ''Operette morali'' (&quot;Small Moral Works&quot;), which consists (in its final form) of a series of 24 innovative dialogues and fictional essays treating a variety of themes that had already become familiar to his work by then. One of the most famous dialogue is: ''Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese'', in which the author expresses his main philosophical ideas.

===''Canti Pisano-Recanatesi'' (1823–1832)===
After 1823, Leopardi abandoned the myths and illustrious figures of the past, which he now considered to be transformed into meaningless symbols and turned to writing about suffering in a more &quot;cosmic&quot; sense.

====''Il Risorgimento''====
In 1828, Leopardi returned to lyric poetry with ''Il Risorgimento'' (&quot;Resurgence&quot;). The poem is essentially a history of the spiritual development of the poet from the day in which he came to believe that every pulse of life had died out in his soul to the moment in which the lyrical and the sentimental were reawakened in him. A strange torpor had rendered him apathetic, indifferent to suffering, to love, to desire, and to hope. Life had seemed desolate to him until the ice began to melt and the soul, reawakening, finally felt the revivification of the ancient illusions. Having reconquered the gift of sentiment, the poet accepts life as it is because it is revived by the feeling of suffering which torments his heart and, so long as he lives, he will not rebel against those who condemn him to live. This recovered serenity consists in the contemplation of one's own conscience of one's own sentiments, even when desolation and despair envelop the soul.

Leopardi rejoices to have rediscovered in himself the capacity to be moved and to experience pain, after a long period of impassibility and boredom. With ''Risorgimento'', lyricism is reawakened in the poet, who composes canti, generally brief, in which a small spark or a scene is expanded, extending itself into an eternal vision of existence. He reevokes images, memories and moments of past happiness.

====''A Silvia''====
[[File:Macerata recanati.jpg|thumb|upright|The tower of [[Recanati]], present on ''Il passero solitario'']]

In 1828, Leopardi composed perhaps his most famous poem, ''A Silvia'' (&quot;To Silvia&quot;). The young lady of the title—possibly the daughter of a servant in the Leopardi household—is the image of the hopes and illusions of the young poet, destined to succumb far too early in the struggle against reality, just as the youth of Silvia is destroyed by tuberculosis, the &quot;chiuso morbo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''A Silvia'', v.41&lt;/ref&gt; It is often asked whether Leopardi was actually in love with this young woman, but to seek confirmation in biographical evidence is to miss the point of the poem. ''A Silvia'' is the expression of a profound and tragic ''love of life'' itself, which Leopardi, despite all the suffering, the psychological torments and the negative philosophizing, could not suppress in his spirit. This poem demonstrates why Leopardi's so-called &quot;nihilism&quot; does not run deep enough to touch the well-spring of his poetry: his love of man, of nature, and of beauty. However, the accusation Leopardi makes against Nature is very strong, as being responsible for the sweet dreams of youth and for the subsequent suffering, after &quot;the appearance of truth&quot; (''l'apparir del vero'', v.60) has shattered them.

====''Il passero solitario''====
The canto ''Il passero solitario'' (&quot;The Lonely Sparrow&quot;) is of a classical perfection for the structure of the verses and for the sharpness of the images. Leopardi contemplates the bounty of nature and the world which smiles at him invitingly, but the poet has become misanthropic and disconsolate with the declining of his health and youth and the deprivation of all joy. He senses the feast which nature puts forth to him, but is unable to take part in it and foresees the remorse which will assail him in the years to come when he will regret the youthful life that he never lived. In this sense, he is alone just like, or worse than, the sparrow, since the latter lives alone by instinct, while the poet is endowed with reason and free will.

====''Le Ricordanze''====
In 1829, at Recanati, where he was constrained to return, against his wishes, because of increasing infirmity and financial difficulties, the poet wrote ''Le Ricordanze'' (&quot;Memories&quot;), perhaps the poem where autobiographical elements are the most evident. It narrates the story of the painful joy of the man who feels his sentiments to be stirred by seeing again places full of childhood and adolescence memories. These sentiments now confront a horrible and merciless reality and deep regret for lost youth. The ephemeral happiness is embodied in Nerina (a character perhaps based on the same inspiration as Silvia, Teresa Fattorini).

Nerina and Silvia are both dreams, evanescent phantasms; life for Leopardi is an illusion, the only reality being death. The woman, Silvia, Nerina, or &quot;la sua donna&quot; are always only the reflection of the poet himself, since life itself is, for him, an elusive and deceptive phantasm.

====''La quiete dopo la tempesta''====
In 1829, Leopardi wrote ''La quiete dopo la tempesta'' (&quot;The Calm After the Storm&quot;), in which the light and reassuring verses at the beginning evolve into the dark desperation of the concluding strophe, where pleasure and joy are conceived of as only momentary cessations of suffering and the highest pleasure is provided only by death. It also delegates with his dignities onto the crowd nor grieving himself on the sorrows he obsessed and afterwards, his prowess dominates.

====''Il sabato del villaggio''====
The same year's ''Il sabato del villaggio'' (&quot;Saturday in the village&quot;), like ''La quiete dopo la tempesta'', opens with the depiction of the calm and reassuring scene of the people of the village (Recanati) preparing for Sunday's rest and feast. Later, just as in the other poem, it expands into deep, though brief and restrained, poetic-philosophical considerations on the emptiness of life: the joy and illusion of expectation must come to an unsatisfactory end in the Sunday feast; likewise, all the sweet dreams and expectations of youth will turn into bitter disillusion.

====''Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'Asia''====
Around the end of 1829 or the first months of 1830, Leopardi composed the ''Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'Asia'' (&quot;Night-time chant of a wandering Asian sheep-herder&quot;). In writing this piece, Leopardi drew inspiration from the reading of ''Voyage d'Orenbourg à Boukhara fait en 1820'', by the Russian baron [[Meyendorff]], in which the baron tells of how certain sheep-herders of central Asia belonging to the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] population practiced a sort of ritual chant consisting of long and sweet strophes directed at the full moon. The canto, which is divided into five strophes of equal length, takes the form of a dialogue between a sheep-herder and the moon. The canto begins with the words &quot;''Che fai tu Luna in ciel? Dimmi, che fai, / silenziosa Luna?''&quot; (&quot;What do you do Moon in the sky? Tell me, what do you do, / silent Moon?&quot;). Throughout the entire poem, in fact, the moon remains silent, and the dialogue is transformed therefore into a long and urgent existential monologue of the sheep-herder, in desperate search of explanations to provide a sense to the pointlessness of existence. The two characters are immersed in an indeterminate space and time, accentuating the universal and symbolic nature of their encounter: the sheep-herder represents the human species as a whole and his doubts are not contingent—that is, anchored to a here and now—but are rather characteristic of man at all times; the moon, on the other hand, represents Nature, the &quot;beautiful and terrible&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Leopardi, ''Operette morali'', &quot;Dialogo della Natura e di un Islandese&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; force that fascinates and, at the same time, terrifies the poet.

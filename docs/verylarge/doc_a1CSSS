Albert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to [[General Trenchard]]'s staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to [[Autigny, Seine-Maritime|Autigny]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Boyle |first= Andrew |author-link= Andrew Boyle |title= Trenchard Man of Vision |year= 1962 |publisher= Collins |location= St James's Place London |page= 360|chapter= Chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied Belgian [[King Albert I]] on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to [[squadron leader]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Heathcote |first= Tony |date= 2012 |title= The British Field Marshals: 1736–1997: A Biographical Dictionary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KAkkUN7s4TIC&amp;pg=PT226 |publisher= Casemate Publisher |isbn= 978-1783461417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied history, economics and civics for a year,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 47; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128–131&lt;/ref&gt; with the historian [[Reginald Vere Laurence|R. V. Laurence]] as his &quot;official mentor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1920 his father created him [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the &quot;Industrial Prince&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280; Judd, p. 72; Townsend, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with a tendency to shyness, caused him to appear less confident in public than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the [[1926 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles|Men's Doubles]] with [[Louis Greig]] in 1926, losing in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in working conditions, and was president of the [[Industrial Welfare Society]]. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 77–86; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

In a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite [[Sheila Chisholm|Lady Loughborough]] came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/457107/Sheila-The-Australian-Ingenue-Who-Bewitched-British-Society-review| last=Henderson| first=Gerard| title=Sheila: The Australian Ingenue Who Bewitched British Society – review| date=31 January 2014| newspaper=Daily Express| access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/28/sheila-who-captured-londons-heart| author=Australian Associated Press| title=A Sheila who captured London's heart| date=28 February 2014| publisher=Special Broadcasting Service| access-date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he met for the first time since childhood [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 94–96; Vickers, pp. 31, 44&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of her mother [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]], Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 77; Judd, pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |editor=Antonia Fraser |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-304-35406-1 |pages=57–58|editor-link=Antonia Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey [[Dean and Chapter of Westminster|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[Dean of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |author-link=John Reith, 1st Baron Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 93–97; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; he began to see [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 98; Rhodes James, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294–295; Judd, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], Australia, during a tour of the empire with the Duchess in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 106; Rhodes James, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Their journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took them via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke and Duchess had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family) who was born in 1926, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] who was born in 1930. The close and loving family lived at 145 [[Piccadilly]], rather than one of the royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Canadian prime minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]]—a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], [[J. H. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reluctant king==
{{Main|Abdication of Edward VIII}}

King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying &quot;After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months&quot; and &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers (the new king, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]) took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by [[British prime minister]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. He abdicated and Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, &quot;When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Britain gossip spread that Albert was physically and psychologically incapable of handling the kingship. He worried about that himself. No evidence has been found to support the rumour that the government considered bypassing him in favour of his scandal-ridden younger brother, George.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 208; Judd, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
[[File:Darlington God save the king..JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three-storey Victorian building festooned with garlands with the words &quot;God Save the King&quot; mounted on the pitched roof|[[Darlington]] Town Hall decorated for the coronation, 1937]]

Albert assumed the [[regnal name]] &quot;George VI&quot; to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 66; Judd, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot; for the abdication broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title &quot;[[Duke of Windsor]]&quot; with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, but the [[letters patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to him automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George VI's coronation]] at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, his mother Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 269, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; When the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot; /&gt; While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 &quot;Mourning will be brief&quot;], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May and June 1939, the [[1939 royal tour of Canada|King and Queen toured Canada]] and the United States; it was the first visit of a reigning British monarch to North America, although he had been to Canada prior to his accession.

The trip was intended to soften the strong [[isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 163–166; Rhodes James, pp. 154–168; Vickers, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor was dispelled.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; They visited the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and stayed with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] and at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|his private estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' Monday, 12 June 1939 p. 12 col. A&lt;/ref&gt; A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Swift |first=Will |title=The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 189; Rhodes James, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

They were subject to [[British rationing]] restrictions, and [[U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goodwin|first=Doris Kearns|author-link=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1994|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1942, the King's brother, the Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 187; Weir, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King George VI with Sir Bernard Montgomery.jpg|thumb|left|George VI (left) with [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] (right), near the front lines in the [[Netherlands]], October 1944]]

In 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, though personally George would have preferred to appoint [[Lord Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed &quot;the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 202–210&lt;/ref&gt; The King related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Weisbrode, Kenneth (2013), ''Churchill and the King'', New York: Viking, pp. 107, 117–118, 148, 154–155, 166. {{ISBN|978-0670025763}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and [[Malta]] in June 1943, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 176, 201–203, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; At a social function in 1944, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Alan Brooke]], revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Sir [[Bernard Montgomery]], he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: &quot;You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Reagan, Geoffrey|year=1992|title=Military Anecdotes|page=25|publisher=Guinness|isbn=978-0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, crowds shouted &quot;We want the King!&quot; in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1946, George addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations]] at their first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed &quot;our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire to Commonwealth==
[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|King George VI and British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]] (left) at Buckingham Palace, July 1945]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; During the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]], [[British India]] became the two independent Dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 229–232, 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In January 1950, he ceased to be King of India when it became a full republic within the Commonwealth and recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 267–270&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], [[Jan Smuts]], was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to his South African bodyguards as &quot;the [[Gestapo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 294; Shawcross, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the tour, Smuts lost [[1948 South African general election|the election the following year]], and the new government instituted a [[apartheid|strict policy of racial segregation]].

==Illness and death==
The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-vi-r1936-1952|access-date=18 April 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 225; Townsend, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; made worse by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent development of [[lung cancer]] among other ailments, including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[Buerger's disease]]. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right [[lumbar sympathectomy]] in March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 314–317&lt;/ref&gt; His elder daughter Elizabeth, the heir presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], taking the place of the King and Queen.

The King was well enough to open the [[Festival of Britain]] in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, he underwent a surgical operation where his entire left [[pneumonectomy|lung was removed]] by [[Clement Price Thomas]] after a malignant tumour was found.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 454; Rhodes James, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1951, Elizabeth and Philip went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in November, the King's [[speech from the throne]] was read for him by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Simonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]{{efn|Renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/our-history|title=About Heathrow Airport: Heathrow's history|publisher=LHR Airports|access-date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to see Elizabeth and Philip off on their tour to Australia via [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. It was his last public appearance. Six days later, at 07:30 [[GMT]] on the morning of 6 February, he was found dead in bed at [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2711000/2711265.stm|title=1952: King George VI dies in his sleep|publisher=BBC|access-date=29 May 2018|date=6 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had died in the night from a [[coronary thrombosis]] at age 56.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1802079.stm|title=The day the King died|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2002|access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[George Hardie (politician)|George Hardie]], the abdication crisis of 1936 did &quot;more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hardie in the British House of Commons, 11 December 1936, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed &quot;a rocking throne&quot; and tried &quot;to make it steady again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from George VI to the Duke of Windsor, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Mike|author-link=Mike Ashley (writer)|year=1998|title=British Monarchs|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=978-1-84119-096-9|pages=703–704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George Cross]] and the [[George Medal]] were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 186; Rhodes James, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He bestowed the George Cross on the entire &quot;[[Siege of Malta (World War II)|island fortress of Malta]]&quot; in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the [[Ordre de la Libération]] by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill) to be awarded the medal after 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|publisher=Ordre de la Libération|access-date=19 September 2009|title=List of Companions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306131445/http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George held a number of titles throughout his life, as successively great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply ''The King'' or ''His Majesty''. In his position as sovereign, George automatically held the position of [[Commander-in-Chief]].

=== Arms ===
As Duke of York, George bore the [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing an anchor [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]—a difference earlier awarded to his father, George V, when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]. As king, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.&lt;ref&gt;Velde, François (19 April 2008), ''[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]'', Heraldica, retrieved 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paul Simon Songbook''''' is the first solo studio album by [[Paul Simon]]. It was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1965. It was made available in the [[United States|U.S.]] as part of the LP box set ''Paul Simon: Collected Works'' (1981). The album was produced by Reginald Warburton and Stanley West as [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] [[LP album|LP]] 62579; remastered [[CD]] [[Legacy Recordings|Columbia/Legacy]] 90281.

==Background==
''The Paul Simon Songbook'' was recorded in [[London]]. Simon made several trips to England in 1964 and '65,  performing in small clubs and theatres. During 1965 he played in Paris, [[Haarlem]] and Copenhagen, along with London and other locations in the UK. In 1964, Simon and [[Art Garfunkel]] had released the folk-inspired album ''[[Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.]]'' in the US. While Simon was touring and appearing on radio shows in England in 1965 (sometimes with Garfunkel), he began to receive attention from fans. At the time ''Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'' had not yet been released in Britain (and would not be until 1968). Simon's other recordings then available in Britain consisted of three 45 rpm singles released on various labels, two of which were rock 'n' roll-inspired recordings with Garfunkel under the name Tom &amp; Jerry. The other was representative of his experiments in folk but had been released in 1964 under the pseudonym Paul Kane. He was still under contract to [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], so he could record for their British label, CBS Records, and therefore decided to record a set of tracks for release to his folk audience. ''The Paul Simon Songbook'' was the result.

==Recording and releases==
Simon recorded the album at Levy's Recording Studio, 73 New Bond Street, London, over several dates in June 1965. Most of the songs required several takes. He only had one [[microphone]] for both his voice and his guitar.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Two songs (&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;) were re-recordings of songs originally found on ''Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.''.  Of the remaining songs, all but two (&quot;A Church is Burning&quot; and &quot;The Side Of A Hill&quot;, although portions of the latter were included as the “Canticle” portion of “Scarborough Fair”) would be subsequently re-recorded in studio versions by Simon and Garfunkel.

=== Diagnosis ===

A number of different instruments are available for the diagnosis of diseases and disorders affecting the retina. [[Ophthalmoscopy]] and [[fundus photography]] have long been used to examine the retina. Recently, [[adaptive optics]] has been used to image individual rods and cones in the living human retina, and a company based in Scotland has engineered technology that allows physicians to observe the complete retina without any discomfort to patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?Index=414 Seeing into the Future] ''Ingenia'', March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electroretinography|electroretinogram]] is used to [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasively]] measure the retina's electrical activity, which is affected by certain diseases. A relatively new technology, now becoming widely available, is [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT). This non-invasive technique allows one to obtain a [[dimension|3D]] volumetric or high resolution cross-sectional [[tomogram]] of the fine structures of the retina, with [[histologic]] quality. [[Retinal vessel analysis]] is a non-invasive method to examine the small arteries and veins in the retina which allows to draw conclusions about the morphology and the function of small vessels elsewhere in the human body. It has been established as a predictor of [[cardiovascular disease]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidelmann |first=SB |display-authors=etal |title=Retinal Vessel Calibers in Predicting Long-Term Cardiovascular Outcomes |date=1 November 2016 |journal=[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]] |volume=134 |issue=18 |pages=1328–1338 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023425|pmid=27682886 |pmc=5219936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have, according to a study published in 2019, potential in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Querques |first=G |display-authors=etal |title=Functional and morphological changes of the retinal vessels in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment |date=11 January 2019 |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=9 |pages=63 |number=63 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-37271-6|pmid=30635610 |pmc=6329813 |bibcode=2019NatSR...9...63Q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===

Treatment depends upon the nature of the disease or disorder.

====Common treatment modalities====
The following are commonly modalities of management for retinal disease:
* [[Intravitreal]] medication, such as [[Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy|anti-VEGF]] or [[corticosteroid]] agents
* [[Vitreoretinal surgery]]
* Use of nutritional supplements
* Modification of systemic risk factors for retinal disease

'''Retinal gene therapy'''
{{Main|Adeno associated virus and gene therapy of the human retina}}

[[Gene therapy]] holds promise as a potential avenue to cure a wide range of retinal diseases. This involves using a non-infectious virus to shuttle a gene into a part of the retina. Recombinant [[adeno-associated virus]] (rAAV) vectors possess a number of features that render them ideally suited for retinal gene therapy, including a lack of pathogenicity, minimal immunogenicity, and the ability to transduce postmitotic cells in a stable and efficient manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Dinculescu Astra |author2 = Glushakova Lyudmyla |author3 = Seok-Hong Min |author4 = Hauswirth William W |year = 2005 |title = Adeno-associated virus-vectored gene therapy for retinal disease |journal = Human Gene Therapy |volume = 16 |issue = 6 |pages = 649–663 |doi = 10.1089/hum.2005.16.649 |pmid = 15960597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rAAV vectors are increasingly utilized for their ability to mediate efficient transduction of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE), [[photoreceptor cells]] and [[retinal ganglion cells]]. Each cell type can be specifically targeted by choosing the appropriate combination of AAV [[serotype]], promoter, and intraocular injection site.

Several clinical trials have already reported positive results using rAAV to treat [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]], showing that the therapy was both safe and effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cideciyan 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Cideciyan A.

The unique architecture of the retina and its relatively immune-privileged environment help this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bennett J |year = 2003 |title = Immune response following intraocular delivery of recombinant viral vectors |journal = Gene Therapy |volume = 10 |issue = 11 |pages = 977–982 |doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302030 |pmid = 12756418 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tight junction]]s that form the [[blood retinal barrier]] separate the subretinal space from the blood supply, thus protecting it from microbes and most immune-mediated damage, and enhancing its potential to respond to vector-mediated therapies. The highly compartmentalized anatomy of the eye facilitates accurate delivery of therapeutic vector suspensions to specific tissues under direct visualization using microsurgical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Curace Enrico M. |author2 = Auricchio Alberto |title = Versatility of AAV vectors for retinal gene transfer |doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2007.07.027 |pmid = 17923143 |date = 2008 |journal = Vision Research |volume = 48 |issue = 3 |pages = 353–359 |s2cid = 9926758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sheltered environment of the retina, AAV vectors are able to maintain high levels of [[transgene]] expression in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, or ganglion cells for long periods of time after a single treatment. In addition, the eye and the visual system can be routinely and easily monitored for visual function and retinal structural changes after injections with noninvasive advanced technology, such as visual acuities, [[contrast sensitivity]], [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] auto-fluorescence (FAF), dark-adapted visual thresholds, vascular diameters, pupillometry, [[electroretinography]] (ERG), multifocal ERG and [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollander2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = den Hollander |first1 = Anneke I. |last2 = Roepman |first2 = Ronald |last3 = Koenekoop |first3 = Robert K. |last4 = Cremers |first4 = Frans P.M. |year = 2008 |title = Leber congenital amaurosis: Genes, proteins and disease mechanisms |journal = Progress in Retinal and Eye Research |volume = 27 |issue = 4 |pages = 391–419 |doi = 10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.05.003 |pmid = 18632300 |s2cid = 30202286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy is effective against a number of retinal diseases that have been studied, including neovascular diseases that are features of [[age-related macular degeneration]], [[diabetic retinopathy]] and [[retinopathy of prematurity]]. Since the regulation of vascularization in the mature retina involves a balance between endogenous positive [[growth factors]], such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and inhibitors of [[angiogenesis]], such as pigment epithelium-derived factor ([[PEDF]]), rAAV-mediated expression of PEDF, angiostatin, and the soluble VEGF receptor sFlt-1, which are all antiangiogenic proteins, have been shown to reduce aberrant vessel formation in animal models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Rolling |first = F. |date = 2004 |title = Recombinant AAV-mediated gene transfer to the retina: gene therapy perspectives |journal = Gene Therapy |volume = 11 |issue = S1 |pages = S26–S32 |doi = 10.1038/sj.gt.3302366 |issn = 0969-7128 |pmid = 15454954 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since specific gene therapies cannot readily be used to treat a significant fraction of patients with retinal dystrophy, there is a major interest in developing a more generally applicable survival factor therapy. [[Neurotrophic factors]] have the ability to modulate neuronal growth during development to maintain existing cells and to allow recovery of injured neuronal populations in the eye. AAV encoding neurotrophic factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members and GDNF either protected photoreceptors from apoptosis or slowed down cell death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling2004&quot; /&gt;

'''Organ transplantation'''
[[Organ transplant|Transplantation]] of retinas has been attempted, but without much success. At [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], The University of Southern California, RWTH Aachen University, and the [[University of New South Wales]], an &quot;artificial retina&quot; is under development: an implant which will bypass the photoreceptors of the retina and stimulate the attached nerve cells directly, with signals from a digital camera.

==History==

In 1894, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] published the first major characterization of retinal neurons in ''Retina der Wirbelthiere'' (''The Retina of Vertebrates'').&lt;ref name=&quot;nobelprize.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title = Santiago Ramón y Cajal – Biographical |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/cajal-bio.html |website = www.nobelprize.org |accessdate = 20 October 2015 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006122025/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/cajal-bio.html |archivedate = 6 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Wald]], [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]], and [[Ragnar Granit]] won the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their scientific research on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/press.html |title = Nobelprize.org |website = nobelprize.org |accessdate = 5 December 2017 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630125508/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/press.html |archivedate = 30 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent [[University of Pennsylvania]] study calculated that the approximate [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of human retinas is 8.75 megabits per second, whereas a [[guinea pig]]'s retinal transfer rate is 875 kilobits per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight.html |title = Calculating the speed of sight |website = newscientist.com |accessdate = 5 December 2017 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150531174437/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight.html |archivedate = 31 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert MacLaren|MacLaren]] &amp; Pearson and colleagues at [[University College London]] and [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] in London, in 2006, showed that [[photoreceptor cells]] could be transplanted successfully in the mouse retina if donor cells were at a critical developmental stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Retinal repair by transplantation of photoreceptor precursors |journal = Nature |doi = 10.1038/nature05161 |pmid = 17093405 |volume = 444 |issue = 7116 |date = November 2006 |pages = 203–7 |last1 = MacLaren |first1 = RE |last2 = Pearson |first2 = RA |last3 = MacNeil |first3 = A |display-authors = etal |bibcode = 2006Natur.444..203M |url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62596/1/nature05161.pdf |hdl = 2027.42/62596 |s2cid = 4415311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Ader and colleagues in Dublin showed, using the electron microscope, that transplanted photoreceptors formed synaptic connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Bartsch |first1 = U. |last2 = Oriyakhel |first2 = W. |last3 = Kenna |first3 = P.

An '''electrolyte''' is a substance that produces an [[conductivity (electrolytic)|electrically conducting solution]] when dissolved in a [[polar solvent]], such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into [[cation]]s and [[anion]]s, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an [[electric potential]] is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[acid]]s, and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]]. Some gases, such as [[hydrogen chloride]], under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., [[DNA]], [[polypeptides]]) and [[synthetic polymer]]s (e.g., [[polystyrene sulfonate]]), termed &quot;[[polyelectrolyte]]s&quot;, which contain charged [[functional group]]s. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. [[Sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[phosphate]] are examples of electrolytes.

In medicine, [[oral rehydration therapy|electrolyte replacement]] is needed when a person has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and as a response to strenuous athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, particularly for sick children (such as [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]] solution, [[Suero Oral]], or [[Pedialyte]]) and athletes ([[sports drink]]s). Electrolyte monitoring is important in the treatment of [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and [[bulimia]].

==Etymology==
The word ''electrolyte'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ήλεκτρο- (''ēlectro''-), prefix related to electricity, and λυτός (''lytos''), meaning &quot;able to be untied or loosened&quot;.

==History==
[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|[[Svante Arrhenius]]]]
In his 1884 dissertation [[Svante Arrhenius]] put forth his explanation of solid crystalline salts disassociating into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-231035-729|page=[https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155 155]|edition=4th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncBrit&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-085-229553-3|page=587|volume=1|edition=15|bibcode=1991neb..book.....G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SciBio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-684101-125|pages=296–302|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrhenius's explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into charged particles, to which [[Michael Faraday]] had given the name &quot;[[ion]]s&quot; many years earlier. Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of [[electrolysis]]. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncBrit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SciBio&quot;/&gt;

==Formation==
Electrolyte solutions are normally formed when salt is placed into a [[solvent]] such as water and the individual components dissociate due to the [[thermodynamic]] interactions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called &quot;[[solvation]]&quot;. For example, when table salt ([[sodium chloride]]), NaCl, is placed in water, the salt (a solid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the dissociation reaction
:NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
It is also possible for substances to react with water, producing ions.  For example, [[carbon dioxide]] gas dissolves in water to produce a solution that contains [[hydronium]], [[carbonate]], and [[Carbonic Acid|hydrogen carbonate]] ions.

[[Molten salt]]s can also be electrolytes as, for example, when sodium chloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity. In particular, ionic liquids, which are molten salts with melting points below 100&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2002 |script-title=zh:离子液体研究进展 |url=http://files.instrument.com.cn/FilesCenter/20100725/201072512514137980.pdf |journal={{lang|zh-hans|化学通报}} |language=zh-hans |issue=4 |page=243 |last1=Shi |first1=Jiahua (石家华) |last2=Sun |first2=Xun (孙逊) |first3=Yang |last3=Chunhe (杨春和) |last4=Gao |first4=Qingyu (高青雨) |last5=Li |first5=Yongfang (李永舫) |accessdate=2017-03-01 |issn=0441-3776 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302031247/http://files.instrument.com.cn/FilesCenter/20100725/201072512514137980.pdf |archive-date=2 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; are a type of highly conductive non-aqueous electrolytes and thus have found more and more applications in fuel cells and batteries.&lt;ref&gt;

An electrolyte in a solution may be described as &quot;concentrated&quot; if it has a high concentration of ions, or &quot;diluted&quot; if it has a low concentration. If a high proportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.

Alkaline earth metals form hydroxides that are strong electrolytes with limited solubility in water, due to the strong attraction between their constituent ions. This limits their application to situations where high solubility is required.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Chemistry: The Central Science, 14th edition, pg. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological importance==
{{See also|Electrochemical gradient|Water–electrolyte imbalance}}

In [[physiology]], the primary ions of electrolytes are [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Monohydrogen phosphate|hydrogen phosphate]] (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[hydrogen carbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alfarouk |first1=Khalid O. |last2=Ahmed |first2=Samrein B.

All known multicellular lifeforms require a subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alfarouk |first1=Khalid O. |last2=Ahmed |first2=Samrein B. M. |last3=Ahmed |first3=Ahmed |last4=Elliott |first4=Robert L. |last5=Ibrahim |first5=Muntaser E. |last6=Ali |first6=Heyam S. |last7=Wales |first7=Christian C. |last8=Nourwali |first8=Ibrahim |last9=Aljarbou |first9=Ahmed N. |last10=Bashir |first10=Adil H.

Such gradients affect and regulate the [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] of the body as well as [[Acid–base homeostasis|blood pH]], and are critical for [[nerve]] and [[muscle]] function. Various mechanisms exist in living species that keep the concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.

Both muscle tissue and [[neuron]]s are considered electric tissues of the body. Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the [[extracellular fluid]] or [[interstitial fluid]], and [[intracellular fluid]]. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the [[plasma membrane]] called &quot;[[ion channels]]&quot;. For example, [[muscle contraction]] is dependent upon the presence of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.

Electrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containing substances, and is regulated by [[hormone]]s, in general with the [[kidney]]s flushing out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte [[homeostasis]] is regulated by hormones such as [[antidiuretic hormone]]s, [[aldosterone]] and [[parathyroid hormone]]s. Serious [[electrolyte disturbance]]s, such as [[dehydration]] and [[Water intoxication|overhydration]], may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a [[medical emergency]].

===Measurement===
Measurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via [[blood test]]ing  with [[ion-selective electrode]]s or [[urinalysis]] by [[medical technologist]]s. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the [[medical history|clinical history]] and is often impossible without parallel measurements of [[renal function]]. The electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for [[arterial blood gas]] interpretations since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the [[specific gravity]] test to determine the occurrence of an [[electrolyte imbalance]].

===Rehydration===
In [[oral rehydration therapy]], electrolyte drinks containing sodium and potassium salts replenish the body's water and electrolyte concentrations after dehydration caused by [[exercise]], [[Alcohol abuse|excessive alcohol consumption]], [[diaphoresis]] (heavy sweating), diarrhea, vomiting, [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or starvation. Athletes exercising in extreme conditions (for three or more hours continuously, e.g. a [[marathon]] or [[triathlon]]) who do not consume electrolytes risk dehydration (or [[hyponatremia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J, Estevez E |author2=Baquero E |author3=Mora-Rodriguez R |title=Anaerobic performance when rehydrating with water or commercially available sports drinks during prolonged exercise in the heat |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism |volume=33 |pages=290–298 |year=2008 |doi=10.1139/H07-188 |pmid=18347684 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolytes are commonly found in [[fruit juice]]s, sports drinks, milk, nuts, and many fruits and vegetables (whole or in juice form) (e.g., potatoes, avocados).

==Electrochemistry==
{{Main|Electrolysis}}
When [[electrode]]s are placed in an electrolyte and a [[voltage]] is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone [[electron]]s normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the [[cathode]], providing electrons to the electrolyte.   Another reaction occurs at the [[anode]], consuming electrons from the electrolyte. As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode. The ions in the electrolyte neutralize these charges, enabling the electrons to keep flowing and the reactions to continue.
[[File:Chloralkali membrane.svg|600px|thumb|right|Electrolytic cell producing chlorine and Sodium hydroxide from a solution of common salt.]]
For example, in a solution of ordinary table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water, the cathode reaction will be
:2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
and [[hydrogen]] gas will bubble up; the anode reaction is
:2NaCl → 2 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
and [[chlorine]] gas will be liberated into solution where it reacts with the sodium and hydroxyl ions to produce sodium hypochloride - household bleach.. The positively charged sodium ions Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will react toward the cathode, neutralizing the negative charge of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; there, and the negatively charged hydroxide ions OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; will react toward the anode, neutralizing the positive charge of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; there. Without the ions from the electrolyte, the charges around the electrode would slow down continued electron flow; [[diffusion]] of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; through water to the other electrode takes longer than movement of the much more prevalent salt ions.
Electrolytes dissociate in water because water molecules are dipoles and the dipoles orient in an energetically favorable manner to solvate the ions.

In other systems, the electrode reactions can involve the metals of the electrodes as well as the ions of the electrolyte.

Electrolytic conductors are used in electronic devices where the chemical reaction at a metal-electrolyte interface yields useful effects.
* In [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], two materials with different electron affinities are used as electrodes; electrons flow from one electrode to the other outside of the battery, while inside the battery the circuit is closed by the electrolyte's ions. Here, the electrode reactions convert chemical energy to electrical energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamil Perzyna, Regina Borkowska, Jaroslaw Syzdek, Aldona Zalewska, Wladyslaw Wieczorek 2011 58–65&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kamil Perzyna |author2=Regina Borkowska |author3=Jaroslaw Syzdek |author4=Aldona Zalewska |author5=Wladyslaw Wieczorek |title=The effect of additive of Lewis acid type on lithium–gel electrolyte characteristics|journal=Electrochimica Acta| volume=57|pages=58–65|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[electroplating]] tanks, the electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal onto the object to be plated, and electrically connects that object in the circuit.
* In operation-hours gauges, two thin columns of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are separated by a small electrolyte-filled gap, and, as charge is passed through the device, the metal dissolves on one side and plates out on the other, causing the visible gap to slowly move along.
* In [[electrolytic capacitor]]s the chemical effect is used to produce an extremely thin [[dielectric]] or [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] coating, while the electrolyte layer behaves as one capacitor plate.
* In some [[hygrometer]]s the humidity of air is sensed by measuring the conductivity of a nearly dry electrolyte.
* Hot, softened glass is an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the glass molten by passing a large current through it.

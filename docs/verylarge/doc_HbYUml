According to Scott Sherman, writing in ''[[The Nation]]'' in April 2007, ''The Sun'' was &quot;a broadsheet that injects conservative ideology into the country's most influential philanthropic, intellectual and media hub; a paper whose day-to-day coverage of New York City emphasizes lower taxes, school vouchers and free-market solutions to urban problems; a paper whose elegant culture pages hold their own against the Times in quality and sophistication; a paper that breaks news and crusades on a single issue; a paper that functions as a journalistic SWAT team against individuals and institutions seen as hostile to Israel and Jews; and a paper that unapologetically displays the scalps of its victims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman&quot;&gt;Sherman, Scott (2007-4-30). [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070430/sherman &quot;''Sun''-rise in New York&quot;]. ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same article, [[Mark Malloch Brown]], [[Kofi Annan]]'s chief of staff at the [[United Nations]], described ''The Sun'' as &quot;a pimple on the backside of American journalism.&quot; According to Sherman, Brown &quot;accepts that the paper's obsession with the UN translates into influence ... he admitted ''The Sun'' &quot;does punch way above its circulation number, on occasion&quot;. He goes on to say, &quot;Clearly amongst its minuscule circulation were a significant number of diplomats. And so it did at times act as some kind of rebel house paper inside the UN. It fed the gossip mills and what was said in the cafeterias.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman&quot;/&gt; Brown's insult was in the context of ''The Sun''{{'}}s reporting of the UN's central role in the [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Oil for food|Oil-for-Food scandal]].

In May 2007, ''[[Adweek]]'' columnist Tom Messner called ''The Sun'' &quot;the best paper in New York&quot;, noting that &quot;''The New York Sun'' is a conservative paper, but it gets the respect of the left. ''The Nation''{{'}}s April 30 issue contains an article on the ''Sun''{{'}}s rise by Scott Sherman that is as balanced an article as I have ever read in the magazine (not a gibe; you don't read ''The Nation'' for balance).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Lance Esplund, Maureen Mullarkey, and David Cohen covered art, [[Francis Morrone]] art and architecture. Literature was extensively covered by [[Otto Penzler]] on mystery writing, [[Eric Ormsby]] on poetry, Carl Rollyson on biography. [[Amanda Gordon]] acted as society editor, [[Alan Wellikoff]] covered cars, and [[Will Friedwald]] wrote about jazz. Nathan Lee, Nicolas Rapold, Bruce Bennett, and Steve Dollar wrote on film.

''The Sun'' received critical praise for its sports section, writers for which included Steven Goldman, [[Thomas Hauser]], [[Sean Lahman]], Tim Marchman, and [[John Hollinger]]. Its [[crossword]] puzzle, edited by Peter Gordon, was called one of the two best in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate:crossword&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145623/ |title=The Ultimate Crossword Smackdown.

''The Sun'' was started anew in 2002 in the face of a long-term decline of [[newspapers in the United States]], loss of advertising revenue to the Internet and the rise of [[new media]].

In March 2009, a group of former contributors to ''The Sun''{{'}}s arts section, including Lance Esplund, [[Brice Brown]], Jay Nordlinger, Joel Lobenthal, and Marion Maneker, spearheaded a new paper, ''CityArts'', published by [[Manhattan Media]]. ''CityArts'' began as a monthly arts supplement in other Manhattan Media papers (including ''[[New York Press]]'', ''West Side Spirit'', and ''Our Town''), but soon changed to a stand-alone, twice-monthly free publication. A notice from 2009 claimed a distribution of 50,000 print copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattanmedia.com/press.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123050115/http://manhattanmedia.com/press.php |date=2012-11-23 }}. Accessed 24 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper's contents were published online at cityarts.info.

Due to low advertising revenue, ''CityArts'' reverted to a supplement in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Howard Mandel |url=http://www.artsjournal.com/jazzbeyondjazz/2012/09/demise-er-downsizing-of-an-new-york-city-arts-review.html |title=Demise — er, downsizing — of a New York City arts review |publisher=Artsjournal.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720041743/http://www.artsjournal.com/jazzbeyondjazz/2012/09/demise-er-downsizing-of-an-new-york-city-arts-review.html |archive-date=2014-07-20 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] written by [[Michael Berlyn]] and published by [[Infocom]] in 1983. Infocom's sixth game, it was released for [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore Plus/4]], [[IBM PC]] (as a [[self-booting disk]]), [[TRS-80]], and [[TI-99/4A]]. It was later available for [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]].

==Background==
[[Image:Suspended box art.jpg|thumb|Later box cover]]

The player's character has been embedded within a facility that controls vital systems, such as moving [[public transportation]] belts and weather control, for an Earth-settled planet called Contra. During the player's five-hundred-year tenure, the player would normally be kept in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] while his sleeping mind serves as the Central Mentality for the largely self-maintaining systems. As the game opens, however, he is awakened by severe error messages; something is going wrong. The facility has suffered catastrophic damage from an [[earthquake]], and the Filtering Computers are shutting down or becoming dangerously unstable. The inhabitants of the city assume that the Central Mentality has gone insane and is purposely harming the city, as a previous CM had done. The player's task is to repair the damage and restore the systems to normal states before a crew arrives at the facility to &quot;disconnect&quot; his mind, killing him, to be replaced with a [[Human cloning|clone]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Suspended on Commodore 64.gif|thumb|upright=2|Start of the game on a C64]]

''Suspended'' takes a novel approach in its game mechanics; rather than being free to move about and interact with the game world directly, the player's character spends the entire game in a state of [[suspended animation]] (hence the title) and can only interact by controlling the actions of a number of [[robot]] surrogates. Each robot has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and describes the same rooms and objects in completely different terms based upon those specializations. The robots are:
*Iris - The only robot with visual sensors, Iris can provide visual descriptions of locations and objects. As the game begins, however, Iris has suffered a burnt-out [[integrated circuit|microchip]] and cannot see. Iris is confined to the area surrounding the Central Chamber.
*Whiz - The most technical robot, Whiz is used mainly for interfacing with a central library computer for historical and technical information.
*Waldo - The most capable physical manipulator, with several limbs for grasping and holding objects, Waldo perceives the world using [[sonar]]. (The term &quot;[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]&quot; was originally coined by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] to describe teleoperated robots.)
*Auda - Auda is equipped with sensitive audio receptors and can provide information on sounds and vibrations.
*Poet - A diagnostic robot, Poet can sense the flow of electricity; he tends to communicate in somewhat cryptic language.
*Sensa - Sensa is specialized for the detection of magnetic and photon emissions.

So, for example, Auda will describe a room primarily in terms of the sounds being generated there, Poet will describe it in terms of diagnostics of the equipment there (and phrase it in amusingly metaphorical language), and Iris will provide a visual description. All six of the robots can be given orders in conjunction, and some of the challenges the player faces require that several of the robots work together to solve them.

There is a seventh robot, an all-purpose multifunction repair robot named Fred, who spends the entirety of the game broken and cannot be repaired.

''Suspended'' has six ways to die.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzt1984spring&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=Spring 1984 |title=Infocom Scoreboard |url=http://infodoc.plover.net/nzt/NZT3.2.pdf |journal=The New Zork Times |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feelies==
The inclusion of physical items in the game package was started with the release of ''[[Deadline (video game)|Deadline]]'' and continued with ''Suspended''. The &quot;feelies&quot; for ''Suspended'' were:
#A map of the facility and small tokens representing each robot. These were intended to allow the player to more easily keep track of each character's whereabouts in the somewhat confusing layout of the facility. Unlike most other text adventure games, the room descriptions of Suspended do not mention the directions of possible exits, which makes the map vital to playing.
#''Briefing for the Contra Central Mentality'', a booklet that provides an overview of the facility, the robots, the computer system, and the player character's responsibilities
#A letter from the Contra Central Lottery Commission Headquarters explaining that the player has been chosen to serve as Central Mentality for the next 500 years
#A Contra Central Mentality Lottery Card

==Reception==
The game sold 99,956 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;infocom_sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/great_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php |title=Great Scott: Infocom's All-Time Sales Numbers Revealed |date=September 20, 2008 |work=GameSetWatch |publisher=Think Services |access-date=September 23, 2008 |authorlink=Simon Carless |url-status=live  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924074642/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/great_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php |archive-date=September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suspended'' was well received by critics. ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' praised the feelies as &quot;continued breakthroughs in packaging and merchandising&quot;, and noted the game's replayability. The magazine concluded that &quot;''Suspended'' represents another milestone in the continuing evolution of the interactive computer novel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berlyn | first = Michael | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&amp;pub=6&amp;id=11 | title=Suspended | journal=Softline | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date=May–Jun 1983 | page=42 | accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' considered each robot to have a unique personality, and praised the use of the library computer as an in-game hint system. The game's parser and time-saving techniques (such as a &quot;follow&quot; command) were similarly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stone | first = David P. | url = http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1983&amp;pub=2&amp;id=11 | title = SUSPENDED : Review | journal = [[Computer Gaming World]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | date = July–August 1983 | pages = 10–11, 46 | accessdate = 18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Moriarty]] of ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' also praised the robots' characterization, stating that &quot;a few hours with these electronic personalities will make them your friends&quot; and comparing the experience to that of &quot;a fine novel&quot;. He concluded that ''Suspended'' and other Infocom products &quot;are among the finest examples of a new and entertaining means of self-expression which can now be regarded as 'literature' without apology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moriarty198307&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Moriarty |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Moriarty |date=July–August 1983 |title=SUSPENDED by Michael Berlyn |url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-12#page/n65/mode/2up |magazine=ANALOG Computing |pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ahoy!]]'' wrote that Berlyn &quot;has lavished a good deal of complexity and eccentricity into his game.

The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Computer Game&quot; at the 5th annual [[Arkie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= February 1984 |title= Arcade Alley: The 1984 Arcade Awards, Part II |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 7|issue= 11|pages= 28–29|issn= 0147-8907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

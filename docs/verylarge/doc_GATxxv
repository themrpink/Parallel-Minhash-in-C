The film's opening sequence, depicting America becoming more crowded with a series of archive photographs set to music, was created by filmmaker [[Charles Braverman]]. The &quot;going home&quot; score in Roth's death scene was conducted by [[Gerald Fried]] and consists of the main themes from [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;6]] (&quot;Pathétique&quot;) by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;6]] (&quot;Pastoral&quot;) by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and the ''[[Peer Gynt Suite]]'' (&quot;[[Morning Mood]]&quot; and &quot;Åse's Death&quot;) by [[Edvard Grieg]].

A custom cabinet unit of the early arcade game ''[[Computer Space]]'' was used in Soylent Green and is considered to be the first video game appearance in a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marty|last1=Goldberg|first2=Curt|last2=Vendel|year=2012|title=Atari Inc: Business is Fun|publisher=Syzygy Press|page=45|isbn=9780985597405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FwGMtRafrAC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
The film was released April 19, 1973, and met with mixed reactions from critics.&lt;ref name=nytreview /&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it &quot;intermittently interesting&quot;, noting that &quot;Heston forsak[es] his granite [[stoicism]] for once&quot;, and asserting the film &quot;will be most remembered for the last appearance of Edward G. Robinson.... In a rueful irony, his death scene, in which he is hygienically dispatched with the help of piped-in light classical music and movies of rich fields flashed before him on a towering screen, is the best in the film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,907127,00.html | title= Cinema: Quick Cuts| date= April 30, 1973| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[A. H. Weiler]] wrote &quot;''Soylent Green'' projects essentially simple, muscular [[melodrama]] a good deal more effectively than it does the potential of man's seemingly witless destruction of the Earth's resources&quot;; Weiler concludes &quot;Richard Fleischer's direction stresses action, not nuances of meaning or characterization. Mr. Robinson is pitiably natural as the realistic, sensitive oldster facing the futility of living in dying surroundings. But Mr. Heston is simply a rough cop chasing standard bad guys.  Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytreview&gt;{{cite web| title= Soylent Green (1973) | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05EFDD1331EF34BC4851DFB2668388669EDE | date= April 20, 1973 | work= [[The New York Times]]| author=A.H.

'''''The Last Laugh''''' ({{lang-de|'''Der letzte Mann''' (The Last Man)}}) is a 1924 German [[silent film]] directed by German director [[F. W. Murnau]] from a screenplay written by [[Carl Mayer]]. The film stars [[Emil Jannings]] and [[Maly Delschaft]]. In German, the title means, &quot;The last man.&quot;

Stephen Brockmann summarized the film's plot as, &quot;a nameless hotel doorman loses his job&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prager473&quot;&gt;Prager, Brad.  A critical history of German film.  Monatshefte, Volume 103, No. 3 (Fall 2011), pp. 472-474; (p.473)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cinematic example of the ''[[Kammerspielfilm]]'' or &quot;chamber-drama&quot; genre, which follows the style of short, sparse plays of lower middle-class life that emphasized the psychology of the characters rather than the sets and action.

The genre tried to avoid the [[intertitles]] (title cards) of spoken dialogue or description that characterize most silent films, in the belief that the visuals themselves should carry most of the meaning.

In 1955, the [[The Last Man (1955 film)|film was remade]] starring [[Hans Albers]].

==Plot==
Jannings' character is a doorman for a famous hotel, who takes great pride in his work and position. His manager decides that the doorman is getting too old and infirm to present the image of the hotel, and so demotes him to a less demanding job, of washroom attendant. He tries to conceal his demotion from his friends and family but, to his shame, he is discovered.  His friends, thinking he has lied to them all along about his prestigious job, taunt him mercilessly while his family rejects him out of shame.  The doorman, shocked and in incredible grief, returns to the hotel to sleep in the washroom where he works.  The only person to be kind towards him is the night watchman, who covers him with his coat as he falls asleep.

Following this comes the film's only title card, which says: &quot;Here our story should really end, for in actual life, the forlorn old man would have little to look forward to but death. The author took pity on him, however, and provided quite an improbable epilogue.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000305/REVIEWS08/3050301/1023 |title=The Last Laugh (1924) |author=Roger Ebert |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=5 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end, the doorman reads in the newspaper that he inherited a fortune from a Mexican millionaire named A. G. Money, a patron who died in his arms in the hotel washroom. The doorman returns to the hotel, where he dines happily with the night watchman who showed him kindness. On their way to the carriage, the doorman gives tips to all the service personnel from the hotel, who quickly line up along his way.  In the final scene of the film, when both the doorman and the night watchman are in the carriage, a beggar asks the doorman for some money. The doorman invites the beggar to the carriage and even gives a tip to the new doorman, who is now in charge of bringing the guests inside.

==Production==
Director F. W. Murnau was at the height of his film career in Germany and had high ambitions for his first film with [[Universum Film AG|UFA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman813&quot;&gt;Wakeman, John.  World Film Directors, Volume 1.  The H.W. Wilson Company.  1987. p.813.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that &quot;All our efforts must be directed towards abstracting everything that isn't the true domain of the cinema. Everything that is trivial and acquired from other sources, all the tricks, devices and cliches inheirited from the stage and from books.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman811&quot;&gt;Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 811.&lt;/ref&gt; Murnau called screenwriter [[Carl Mayer]] someone who worked in &quot;the true domain of the cinema&quot; and agreed to make ''Der letzte Mann'' after Mayer and film director [[Lupu Pick]] fought and Pick left the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;&gt;Wakeman. pp. 812.&lt;/ref&gt; The film famously uses no intertitles, which had previously been done by Mayer and Pick on ''[[Shattered (1921 film)|Scherben]]'' and ''[[New Year's Eve (1924 film)|Sylvester]]'' several years earlier, as well as by director [[Arthur Robison]] in the film ''[[Schatten – Eine nächtliche Halluzination|Schatten]]'' in 1923.
The film was shot entirely at the UFA Studios. Murnau and cinematographer [[Karl Freund]] used elaborate camera movements for the film, a technique later called &quot;''[[Unchained camera technique|entfesselte Kamera]]''&quot; (unchained camera). In one scene a camera was strapped to Freund's chest as he rode a bicycle into an elevator and onto the street below. In another scene a camera is sent down a wire from a window to the street below, and later reversed in editing. French filmmaker [[Marcel Carné]] later said that &quot;The camera...glides, rises, zooms or weaves where the story takes it. It is no longer fixed, but takes part in the action and becomes a character in the drama.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt; Years later Karl Freund dismissed Murnau's contributions to the films that they made together, claiming that Murnau had no interest in lighting and never looked through the camera, and that &quot;Carl Mayer used to take much more interest than he did in framing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt; The film's set designers [[Robert Herlth]] and [[Walter Rohrig]] denied this statement and defended Murnau. Murnau described the film's cinematography as being &quot;on account of the way... [objects] were placed or photographed, their image is a visual drama. In their relationship with other objects or with the characters, they are units in the symphony of the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt;

Murnau noted that the story was absurd on the grounds that &quot;everyone knows that a washroom attendant makes more than a doorman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kino DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

The signs in the film are written in an imaginary language that [[Alfred Hitchcock]] took as [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schotter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schotter |first1=Jesse |title=Hieroglyphic Modernisms: Writing and New Media in the Twentieth Century |date=2018 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9781474424783 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGiDDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=murnau+esperanto&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=18 October 2019 |language=en}}. It mentions the words ''Etali'' and ''Farina'' as examples of Esperanto signs. It references &quot;[Hitchcock's] [[Hitchcock/Truffaut|famous interview with François Truffaut]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and artistic technique ==
The moving of the location of the camera, blurring of a part of the screen, focusing and defocusing, combined with using different angles, contributed to creating new perspectives and impressions of the viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin35&quot;&gt;Franklin, James, C.  Teaching culture through film: Der letzte Mann.  Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German.  Volume 13, No. 1 (Spring 1980), p. 35, pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The montage that was used in putting the scenes together was also pioneering:  Murnau's technique was to use a smooth and rapid cutting in the initial scenes followed by jarred cutting in the scenes where the doorman becomes humiliated.  A combination of distortion and overlapping of images was used in the scenes illustrating private vision of the drunk doorman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figge-Montage314&quot;&gt;Figge, Richard, C.  Montage:  The German film of the Twenties.  Penn State University Press.  URL:  https://www.jstor.org/stable/40246138.  Accessed 6 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The artistic part of the movie was in the acting of Emil Jannings playing the role of the doorman.  Jannings used creatively his facial expressions, postures and movements, to which the cameramen provided enhancements by using close ups and the location of camera in such a way that the viewer sees nearly through the eyes of the doorman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin35&quot;/&gt;

Decorations and presentation of contrasting environments were also significant in creating the impression.  The contrast between the rich environment of the Atlantic hotel and the lower class housing, gives an impression of a realistic presentation of  situations.  The decorators for ''Der Letzte Mann'' were Robert Hearlth and Walter Röhring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin34&quot;&gt;Franklin, James, C.  Teaching culture through film: Der letzte Mann.  Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German.  Volume 13, No. 1 (Spring 1980), p. 34, pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another use of contrast was the illustration of the respect and essentially the power of the uniform combined with the ridicule and disregard which the doorman experienced after his demotion.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The power of the uniform in the German culture was analyzed in a scholarly article by Jon Hughes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huges439&quot;&gt;Hughes, Jon.  'Zivil ist allemal schadlich'.  Clothing in German-language culture of the 1920s.  Neophilologus, Volume 88 (2004), p. 439, pp. 429-445.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wearing of a uniform appears to enhance masculinity of the person and provides some institutional power, as the wearer identifies himself/herself with the corresponding institution.  Therefore, a uniform provides personal confidence and the respect of others,&lt;ref name=&quot;Huges439&quot;/&gt; as illustrated in ''Der letzte Mann''.  The quick ascension of the Nazis to power could also be attributed to their widespread use of uniforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huges444&quot;&gt;Hughes, Jon.  'Zivil ist allemal schadlich'.  Clothing in German-language culture of the 1920s.  Neophilologus, Volume 88 (2004), p. 444, pp. 429-445.&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''Der letzte Mann'' illustrates clearly this effect of self-confidence and personal/institutional power as connected to wearing of a decorated uniform.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Historical context ==
The film was made in 1924, at the time of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The war reparation payments imposed on Germany caused skyrocketing [[inflation]], economic collapse, food shortages, poverty, malnutrition and hunger.&lt;!--No they didn't, Germany hardly paid a penny, most of it came from US loans after 1923--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin33&quot;&gt;Franklin, James C. &quot;Teaching culture through film: Der letzte Mann.&quot; ''Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German'', Volume 13, No. 1 (Spring 1980), p. 33, pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Petit bourgeois Germans were looking for some hope for improvement of their economic situation.  Even such an unrealistic possibility as inheriting money from somebody else brought some hope.  This need for hope and the director's knowledge of the expectations of the general public were the reasons that ''Der letzte Mann'' had a happy, although unrealistic, epilogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of German Film|last=Brockman|first=Stephen|publisher=Camden House|year=2010|isbn=978-1-57113-468-4|location=Rochester, New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German cinema began co-operative ventures with Hollywood producers, which led to mutual influence and in 1926 the German producers signed a contract with [[Hollywood]], which started a migration of German actors and directors to Hollywood. The effect was similar to the later-observed [[brain drain]] of scientists from all over the world to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin36&quot;&gt;Franklin, James, C. &quot;Teaching culture through film: Der letzte Mann.&quot; ''Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German'', Volume 13, No. 1 (Spring 1980), p. 36, pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the results of this early cooperation was that director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] went to Berlin and started working with Friedrich Murnau.  Hitchcock was very impressed with Murnau's [[Unchained camera technique|unchained camera]] techniques and stated that his cooperation with Murnau was an &quot;enormously productive experience&quot; and that ''Der letzte Mann'' was an &quot;almost perfect film&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bade257&quot;&gt;Bade, James, N. &quot;Murnau's 'The Last Laugh' and Hitchcock's subjective camera.&quot; ''Quarterly Review of Film and Video'',  Volume 23 (2006), p. 257, pp. 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cooperation with Murnau was for Hitchcock essentially a &quot;key reference point&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bade258&quot;&gt;Bade, James, N. &quot;Murnau's 'The Last Laugh' and Hitchcock's subjective camera.&quot; ''Quarterly Review of Film and Video'', Volume 23 (2006), p. 258, pp. 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitchcock also expressed his appreciation for Murnau's camera-points-of-view and the subjective shots which provided &quot;audience identification&quot; with the main character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bade256&quot;&gt;Bade, James, N. &quot;Murnau's 'The Last Laugh' and Hitchcock's subjective camera.&quot; ''Quarterly Review of Film and Video'', Volume 23 (2006), p. 256, pp. 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rating of ''Der letzte Mann'' in Hollywood was very high: &quot;Hollywood simply raved about ''The Last Laugh'',&quot; noted Jan Horak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horak242&quot;&gt;Horak, Jan. &quot;Sauerkraut and sausages with a little goulash: Germans in Hollywood, 1927.&quot; ''Film History: An International Journal'', Volume 17, N0. 2/3 (2005), p. 242, pp. 241-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
The film was a major critical and financial success and allowed Murnau to make two big budget films shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman813&quot;/&gt; Critics praised the film's style and artistic camera movements. Film critic [[Paul Rotha]] said that it &quot;definitely established the film as an independent medium of expression...Everything that had to be said...was said entirely through the camera...''The Last Laugh'' was cine-fiction in its purest form; exemplary of the rhythmic composition proper to the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt; Years later [[C. A. Lejeune]] called it &quot;probably the least sensational and certainly the most important of Murnau's films. It gave the camera a new dominion, a new freedom...It influenced the future of motion picture photography...all over the world, and without suggesting any revolution in method, without storming critical opinion as ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|Caligari]]'' had done, it turned technical attention towards experiment, and stimulated...a new kind of camera-thinking with a definite narrative end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt; [[Lotte Eisner]] praised its &quot;opalescent surfaces streaming with reflections, rain, or light: car windows, the glazed leaves of the revolving door reflecting the silhouette of the doorman dressed in a gleaming black waterproof, the dark mass of houses with lighted windows, wet pavements and shimmering puddles...His camera captures the filtered half-light falling from the street lamps...it seizes railings through basement windows.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt;

The film's story and content were also praised by critics, with Eisner stating that it &quot;is pre-eminently a German tragedy, and can only be understood in a country where uniform is king, not to say god. A non-German mind will have difficulty in comprehending all its tragic implications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman811&quot;/&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] pointed out that &quot;all the tenants, in particular the female ones...[revere the uniform] as a symbol of supreme authority and are happy to be allowed to revere it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman. pp. 812&quot;/&gt;

In 2000, [[Roger Ebert]] included it among his list of Great Movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot;/&gt;

'''''Life After Life''''' is a 1975 book written by [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]]. It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone [[near-death experience]]s (NDEs). The book presents the author's composite account of what it is like to die.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifton D. Bryant]] (2003).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*(a) an overwhelming feeling of peace and well-being, including freedom from pain.
*(b) the impression of being located outside one's physical body.
*(c) floating or drifting through darkness, sometimes described as a tunnel.
*(d) becoming aware of a golden light.
*(e) encountering and perhaps communicating with a &quot;being of light&quot;.
*(f) having a rapid succession of visual images of one's past.
*(g) experiencing another world of much beauty.&lt;ref name=hji&gt;Harvey J. Irwin and Caroline Watt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E3EzxyOufbgC&amp;dq=attacks+on+parapsychology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s An introduction to parapsychology] McFarland, 2007, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Life After Life'' sold more than 13 million copies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/22/1079939578423.html Towards the light] ''The Age'', March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; was translated into a dozen foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Louis E.

==Reception==
Moody's alleged evidence for an [[afterlife]] was heavily criticized as flawed, both logically and empirically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Beyerstein]]. (1990). ''Evaluating the Anomalous Experience''. In [[Kendrick Frazier]]. ''The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 43–53. {{ISBN|0-87975-655-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[James Alcock]] has noted that &quot;[Moody] appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]]. (1981). ''Psychology and Near-Death Experiences''. In [[Kendrick Frazier]]. ''Paranormal Borderlands of Science''. Prometheus Books. pp. 153–169. {{ISBN|0-87975-148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] has written that Moody's evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analyses of his data. According to Kurtz &quot;there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz]]. (1991). ''Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz''. Transaction Publishers. p. 349. {{ISBN|1-56000-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Am Legend''''' is a 1954 [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[horror fiction|horror novel]] by American writer [[Richard Matheson]] that was influential in the modern development of [[zombie]] and [[vampire literature]] and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted into the films ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971), and ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' (2007). It was also an inspiration behind ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).

==Plot summary==
Robert Neville appears to be the sole survivor of a [[pandemic]] that has killed most of the human population and turned the remainder into &quot;[[vampire]]s&quot; that largely conform to their stereotypes in fiction and folklore: they are [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]], pale-skinned, and nocturnal, though otherwise indistinguishable from normal humans. Implicitly set in [[Los Angeles]], the novel details Neville's life in the months and eventually years after the outbreak as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease. Swarms of vampires surround his house nightly and try to find ways to get inside, which includes the females exposing themselves and his vampire neighbor relentlessly shouting for him to come out. Neville survives by barricading himself inside his house every night; he is further protected by the [[Vampire#Protection|traditional vampire repellents]] of garlic, mirrors, and [[crucifix]]es. Weekly dust storms ravage the city, and during the day, when the vampires are inactive, Neville drives around to search them out in order to kill them with wooden stakes (since they seem impervious to his guns' bullets) and to scavenge for supplies. Neville's past is occasionally revealed through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]; the disease claimed his daughter, whose body the government forced him to burn, as well as his wife, whose body he secretly buried but then had to kill after she rose from the dead as a vampire. 

After bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]], Neville finally determines there must be some scientific reasons behind the vampires' origins, behaviors, and aversions, so he sets out to investigate. He obtains books and other research materials from a library and through gradual research discovers the root of the disease is probably a ''[[Bacillus]]'' strain of [[bacteria]] capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. His experiments with microscopes also reveal that the bacteria are deadly sensitive to garlic and sunlight. One day, a stray, injured dog finds its way to his street, filling Neville with amazed joy. Desperate for company, Neville painstakingly earns the nervous dog's trust with food and brings it into the home. Despite his efforts, the sickly dog dies a week later, and Neville, robbed of all hope, resignedly returns to learning more about the vampires.

Neville's continued readings and experiments on incapacitated vampires help him create new theories. He believes vampires are affected by mirrors and crosses because of &quot;[[Conversion disorder|hysterical blindness]]&quot;, the result of previous [[Operant conditioning|psychological conditioning]] of the infected. Driven [[insanity|insane]] by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not. Neville additionally discovers more efficient means of killing the vampires, other than just driving a stake into their hearts. This includes exposing vampires to direct sunlight or inflicting wide, oxygen-exposing wounds anywhere on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] to [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[Parasitism|parasites]], rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air, which gives the appearance of the vampires instantly liquefying. However, the bacteria also produce resilient &quot;body glue&quot; that instantly seals blunt or narrow wounds, making the vampires bulletproof. With his new knowledge, Neville is killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly. Neville further believes the pandemic was spread not so much by direct vampire bites as by bacteria-bearing mosquitos and dust storms in the cities following a recent war. The inconsistency of Neville's results in handling vampires also leads him to realize that there are in fact two differently-reacting types of vampires: those conscious and living with a worsening infection and those who have died but been reanimated by the bacteria (i.e. [[undead]]).

After three years, Neville sees a terrified woman in broad daylight. Neville is immediately suspicious after she recoils violently in the presence of garlic, but they slowly win each other's trust. Eventually, the two comfort each other romantically and he explains some of his findings, including his theory that he developed [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against the infection after being bitten by an infected [[vampire bat]] years ago. He wants to know if the woman, named Ruth, is infected or immune, vowing to treat her if she is infected, and she reluctantly allows him to take a [[Sampling (medicine)#blood|blood sample]] but suddenly knocks him unconscious as he views the results. When Neville wakes, he discovers a note from Ruth confessing that she is indeed a vampire sent to spy on him and that he was responsible for the death of her husband, another vampire. The note further suggests that only the undead vampires are pathologically violent but not those who were alive at the time of infection and who still survive due to chance mutations in their bacteria. These living-infected have slowly overcome their disease and are attempting to build a new society. They have developed medication that diminishes the worst of their symptoms. Ruth warns Neville that her feelings for him are true but that her people will attempt to capture him and that he should try to escape the city.

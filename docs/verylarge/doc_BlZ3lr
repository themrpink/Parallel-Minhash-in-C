[[File:AwrdrmBT1.jpg|thumb|Tyler at her home in Wales, 1993.]]
In 1990, Tyler signed to [[Hansa Records|Hansa]]/[[Ariola Records|BMG Ariola]] and began working with various producers for her eighth studio album. She collaborated with [[Dieter Bohlen]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Nik Kershaw]] and [[Roy Bittan]]. “We used so many producers in efforts to capture many different moods for many different territories, because we believed in the international crossover potential of Tyler,” stated David Brunner, A&amp;R manager for Hansa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=7 December 1991 |title=Spotlight – Germany – Bonnie Tyler |magazine=[[Music &amp; Media]] |page=17 |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bitterblue]]'' was released on 11 November 1991. In a retrospective review, [[AllMusic]]'s Tomas Mureika noted that the album marked a &quot;much more mainstream and less bombastic&quot; direction in Tyler's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitterblue-mw0001047120 |title=Bonnie Tyler – Bitterblue |publisher=[[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bitterblue (song)|title track]] was released a month ahead of the album and became a top 40 hit in several European countries. It was named ‘Catchy Song of the Year’ at the RSH-Gold Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsh-history.de/RSH-Gold-1992.htm |title=RSH – Wie alles begann... – RSH Gold 1992 |publisher=Rsh-history.de |date=15 February 1992 |access-date=15 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325041432/http://www.rsh-history.de/RSH-Gold-1992.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, “Bitterblue” was released as a promotional single in the United States where it was met with criticism. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that “bombastic production, with a rush of bagpipes and a choir of chirping children at the forefront, overpower Tyler's distinctive raspy voice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Larry |last=Flick |date=1 August 1992 |title=Single Reviews |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=102 |location=New York City, NY, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Bitterblue'' was never released in the UK or USA, the album was a commercial success in mainland Europe. It topped the charts in Austria and Norway, achieving 4x Platinum status in the latter country with eleven weeks at no. 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite certification |region=Norway |artist=Bonnie Tyler |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler's subsequent albums, ''[[Angel Heart (Bonnie Tyler album)|Angel Heart]]'' (1992) and ''[[Silhouette in Red]]'' (1993), were also successful in mainland Europe. Both albums featured a greater share of songs written and produced by Dieter Bohlen. Tyler was named Best International Singer at the [[Goldene Europa|Goldene Europa Awards]] in 1993, and Best Pop/Rock Singer at the [[Echo Music Prize|ECHO Awards]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Roxburgh |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=bonnie_tyler_to_represent_united_kingdom |title=Bonnie Tyler to represent United Kingdom |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |access-date=20 June 2014 |date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614223004/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=bonnie_tyler_to_represent_united_kingdom |archive-date=14 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was re-released in March 1996 featuring a cover of “Limelight” by [[the Alan Parsons Project]]. The track was used as a theme for the German team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Chris |last=Morris |date=10 August 1996 |title=Olympic Releases |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=83 |location=New York City, NY, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler attended church until she was sixteen years old. Her first ever performance was singing &quot;[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]&quot; in church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southwestwales/hi/people_and_places/music/newsid_8271000/8271706.stm |title=Singing roots to Total Eclipse |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=22 June 2014|date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also exposed to the music of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[The Beatles]] and other 60s bands due to her siblings's musical tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; [[Frankie Miller]] was the first live act that Tyler saw, and she later recorded duets with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andreipartos.ro/interviu-exclusiv-cu-bonnie-tyler-realizat-de-andrei-partos-10-11-2014/ |title=Interviu Exclusiv Cu Bonnie Tyler |publisher=andreipartos.ro |language=ro |date=15 November 2014 |access-date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler's two biggest influences from a young age were [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Tina Turner]]. She cites &quot;[[River Deep – Mountain High]]&quot; as being her all-time favourite song.&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; Other artists that influenced Tyler in her youth include [[Aretha Franklin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; [[Wilson Pickett]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BatSegundo&quot; /&gt; [[Meat Loaf]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; [[Joe Cocker]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; [[Dusty Springfield]]&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; and [[Tommy Steele]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt; She has also expressed admiration for contemporary artists such as [[Guns N' Roses]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TracksOfMyYears&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock4Asia&quot;&gt;EMS Music / Locomotive Music, ''Rock For Asia – Das Charity-Konzert Open Air 2005'' DVD (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anastacia]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BatSegundo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CapitalInterview01&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Mick |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iozl67fVYrM |title=2001 radio interview |publisher=[[Gold (radio)|Capital Gold]] |access-date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eminem]].

===Vocal style===
Tyler's music contains elements of country, rock, pop, blues and Celtic. Her voice has been likened to [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Kim Carnes]] as a result of her [[vocal cord nodule]] operation in the 1970s,&lt;ref name=&quot;FreeSpiritAllmusicReview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/free-spirit-mw0000176714 |title=Bonnie Tyler – Free Spirit Album Review |journal=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |last=Promis |first=Jose F. |access-date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes even being referenced as &quot;the female Rod Stewart&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/eurovision-2013.html |title=BBC announces Bonnie Tyler as United Kingdom representative at Eurovision 2013 |work=BBC News |date=7 March 2013 |access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after her collaborations with Jim Steinman, &quot;the female Meat Loaf&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19830723&amp;id=BFwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RKcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4301,1404478 |title=Bonnie Tyler doesn't loaf on her comeback album |date=23 July 1983 |access-date=25 August 2014 |first=Al |last=Walentis |newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after her operation, when recording her second album, ''Natural Force'', the studio band complimented Tyler's changed voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/10/bonnie-tyler-husky-voice |title=Bonnie Tyler: 'Forget being a star – do it for the love of it' |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=23 June 2014 |date=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers from AllMusic have described Tyler's voice as &quot;inimitable&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WingsallmusicReview&quot; /&gt; &quot;wonderfully gritty&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/total-eclipse-of-the-heart-mt0048045343 |title=Bonnie Tyler – Total Eclipse of the Heart – Song Review |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

In a review of ''Rocks and Honey'', ''OMH Media'' described Tyler's vocals as being &quot;good for only one thing and that's belting out gravelly vocals&quot;, suggesting that she sounds like [[Johnny Cash]] in his later years when she &quot;tries to restrain [her voice]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ingham |first=Thomas |title=Album Reviews Bonnie Tyler – Rocks And Honey |url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/bonnie-tyler-rocks-and-honey |access-date=23 June 2014 |newspaper=OMH Media |date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to her modern voice, ''[[The Yorkshire Times]]'' wrote that Tyler's vocals have &quot;still got what it takes to make you tingle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RocksandHoneyReviewYTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Jeremy |title=Bonnie Tyler – Rocks and Honey |url=http://yorkshiretimes.co.uk/article/Bonnie-Tyler--Rocks-and-Honey?fb_action_ids=576375779062906&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%7B%22576375779062906%22%3A513973765331262%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%22576375779062906%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D |access-date=20 June 2014 |newspaper=The Yorkshire Times |date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Steinman told ''People'' magazine that he wrote &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; as a &quot;showpiece for [Tyler's] voice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Jim |last=Beviglia |title=Bonnie Tyler, &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2014/02/bonnie-tyler-total-eclipse-heart/ |magazine=American Songwriter |date=24 February 2014 |access-date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AllMusic said that Tyler's voice &quot;produced the perfect type of 'desperate lovelorn' effect to suit the romantic lyrics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/total-eclipse-of-the-heart-mt0048045343 |title=Bonnie Tyler – Total Eclipse of the Heart – Song Review |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

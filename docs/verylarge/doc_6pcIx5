However O.T. Falk &amp; Partners specified they would only invest in Whittle's engine if they had independent verification that it was feasible.&lt;ref name = Bramson/&gt; They financed an independent engineering review from Bramson (The historic&lt;ref name=&quot;Golley 1987, p. 67&quot;/&gt; &quot;Bramson Report&quot;&lt;ref name = Bramson&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meher-Homji|first= Cyrus B. |year= 2002|title= Enabling the Turbojet Revolution – The Bramson Report|url= http://files.asme.org/IGTI/News/25224.pdf |publisher= American Society of Mechanical Engineers|volume= 42|issue= 1|pages= 16–20|access-date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was favourable and Falk then agreed to finance Whittle.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; With that the jet engine was finally on its way to becoming a reality.

On 27 January 1936, the principals signed the &quot;Four Party Agreement&quot;, creating &quot;[[Power Jets]] Ltd&quot; which was incorporated in March 1936. The parties were O.T. Falk &amp; Partners, the Air Ministry, Whittle and, together, Williams and Tinling. Falk was represented on the board of Power Jets by Whyte as chairman and Bonham-Carter as a director (with Bramson acting as alternate&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Whittle, Williams and Tinling retained a 49% share of the company in exchange for Falk and Partners putting in £2,000 with the option of a further £18,000 within 18 months.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;[http://www.frankwhittle.co.uk/content.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=6&amp;docFatherId=1&amp;level=sub POWER JETS A brief biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004135944/http://www.frankwhittle.co.uk/content.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=6&amp;docFatherId=1&amp;level=sub |date=4 October 2011 }}, ''The Sir Frank Whittle Commemorative Trust''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; As Whittle was still a full-time RAF officer and currently at Cambridge, he was given the title &quot;Honorary Chief Engineer and Technical Consultant&quot;. Needing special permission to work outside the RAF, he was placed on the Special Duty List and allowed to work on the design as long as it was for no more than six hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However he was allowed to continue at Cambridge for a year doing post-graduate work which gave him time to work on the turbojet.&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Ministry still saw little immediate value in the effort (they regarded it as long-range research&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, pp. 71 &amp; 77&lt;/ref&gt;), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH) to build an experimental engine facility at a BTH factory in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Work progressed quickly, and by the end of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were well on their way to being completed, all within the original £2,000 budget.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines ([[Herbert A. Wagner]] at [[Junkers]] and [[Hans von Ohain]] at [[Heinkel]]) and, although they too had difficulty overcoming conservatism, the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|German Ministry of Aviation]] (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) was more supportive than their British counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, pp. 77 &amp; 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial difficulty===
Earlier, in January, when the company formed, [[Henry Tizard]], the rector of [[Imperial College London]] and chairman of the [[Aeronautical Research Committee]] (ARC), had prompted the Air Ministry's Director of Scientific Research to ask for a write-up of the design. The report was once again passed on to Griffith for comment, but was not received back until March 1937 by which point Whittle's design was well along. Griffith had already started construction of his own turbine engine design and, perhaps to avoid tainting his own efforts, he returned a somewhat more positive review. However, he remained highly critical of some features, notably the use of jet thrust. The Engine Sub-Committee of ARC studied Griffith's report, and decided to fund his effort instead.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

Given this astonishing display of official indifference, Falk and Partners gave notice that they could not provide funding beyond £5,000.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; Nevertheless, the team pressed ahead, and the [[Power Jets WU]] (Whittle Unit) engine ran successfully on 12 April 1937. Tizard pronounced it &quot;streaks ahead&quot; of any other advanced engine he had seen, and managed to interest the [[Air Ministry]] enough to fund development with a contract for £5,000 to develop a flyable version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahum 37–38&quot;&gt;Nahum 2004, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was a year before the funds were made available, greatly delaying development.

In July, when Whittle's stay at Cambridge was over, he was released to work full-time on the engine. On 8 July Falk gave the company an emergency loan of £250, and on the 15th they agreed to find £4,000 to £14,000 in additional funding. The money never arrived and, entering into default, Falk's shares were returned to Williams, Tinling and Whittle on 1 November. Nevertheless, Falk arranged another loan of £3,000, and work continued.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; Whittle was promoted to [[Squadron Leader]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing continued with the W.U., which showed an alarming tendency to race out of control. Because of the dangerous nature of the work being carried out, development was largely moved from Rugby to BTH's lightly used Ladywood foundry at nearby [[Lutterworth]] in Leicestershire in 1938, where there was a successful run of the W.U. in March that year. BTH had decided to put in £2,500 of their own in January, and in March 1938 the Air Ministry funds finally arrived. This proved to be a mixed blessing – the company was now subject to the [[Official Secrets Act]], which made it extremely difficult to gather more private equity.

[[File:Gloster E28-39 first prototyp lr.jpg|thumb|The [[Gloster E.28/39]], the first British aircraft to fly with a turbojet engine]]
These delays and the lack of funding slowed the project. In Germany, [[Hans von Ohain]] had started work on a prototype in 1935, and had by this point passed the prototype stage and was building the world's first flyable [[Jet aircraft]], the [[Heinkel HeS 3]]. There is little doubt that Whittle's efforts would have been at the same level or even more advanced had the Air Ministry taken a greater interest in the design. When [[World War II|war]] broke out in September 1939, Power Jets had a payroll of only 10 and Griffith's operations at the RAE and [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] were similarly small.

The stress of the continual on-again-off-again development and problems with the engine took a serious toll on Whittle.
{{cquote|The responsibility that rests on my shoulders is very heavy indeed.&amp;nbsp;... either we place a powerful new weapon in the hands of the Royal Air Force or, if we fail to get our results in time, we may have falsely raised hopes and caused action to be taken which may deprive the Royal Air Force of hundreds of [conventional] aircraft that it badly needs.&amp;nbsp;... I have a good crowd round me.

His smoking increased to three packs a day and he suffered from various stress-related ailments such as frequent severe headaches, indigestion, insomnia, anxiety, [[eczema]] and heart palpitations,&lt;ref name = Golley148&gt;Golley 1987, pp. 149 &amp; 150&lt;/ref&gt; while his weight dropped to nine&amp;nbsp;stone (126&amp;nbsp;lb / 57&amp;nbsp;kg). To keep to his 16-hour workdays, he sniffed [[Benzedrine]] during the day and then took tranquillizers and sleeping pills at night to offset the effects and allow him to sleep. He admitted later he had become addicted to benzedrine.&lt;ref name = Golley148/&gt; Over this period he became irritable and developed an &quot;explosive&quot; temper.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, pp. 79–80, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing fortunes===
By June 1939, Power Jets could barely afford to keep the lights on when yet another visit was made by Air Ministry personnel. This time Whittle was able to run the W.U. at high power for 20&amp;nbsp;minutes without any difficulty. One of the members of the team was the Director of Scientific Research, [[David Randall Pye]], who walked out of the demonstration utterly convinced of the importance of the project. The Ministry agreed to buy the W.U. and then loan it back to them, injecting cash, and placed an order for a flyable version of the engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahum 37–38&quot;/&gt;

Whittle had already studied the problem of turning the massive W.U. into a flyable design, with what he described as very optimistic targets, to power a little aeroplane weighing 2,000 lb with a static thrust of 1,389 lb.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Early History of the Whittle Jet Propulsion Gas Turbine&quot; Air Commodore F. Whittle, James Clayton Memorial Lecture 1945, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, p.423, Fig.4&lt;/ref&gt; With the new contract work started in earnest on the &quot;[[Power Jets W.1|Whittle Supercharger Type W.1]]&quot;. It featured a reverse-flow design; air from the compressor was fed rearwards into the combustion chambers, then back towards the front of the engine, then finally reversing again into the turbine. This design reduced the length of the engine, and the length of the drive shaft connecting the compressor and turbine, thus reducing weight.

In January 1940, the Ministry placed a contract with the [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] for a simple aircraft specifically to flight-test the W.1, the [[Gloster E.28/39]]. They also placed a second engine contract, this time for a larger design that developed into the otherwise similar [[Power Jets W.2|W.2]]. In February work started on a third design, the W.1A, which was the size of the W.1 but used the W.2's mechanical layout. The W.1A allowed them to flight test the W.2's basic mechanical design in the E.28/39. Power Jets also spent some time in May 1940 drawing up the W.2Y, a similar design with a &quot;straight-through&quot; airflow that resulted in a longer engine and, more critically, a longer driveshaft but having a somewhat simpler layout. To reduce the weight of the driveshaft as much as possible, the W.2Y used a large diameter, thin-walled, shaft almost as large as the turbine disc, &quot;necked down&quot; at either end where it connected to the turbine and compressor.

In April, the Air Ministry issued contracts for W.2 production lines with a capacity of up to 3,000 engines a month in 1942, asking BTH, [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and the [[Rover Company]] to join. However, the contract was eventually taken up by Rover only.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Whittle received a promotion to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rover===
Meanwhile, work continued with the W.U., which eventually went through nine rebuilds in an attempt to solve the combustion problems that had dominated the testing. On 9 October the W.U. ran once again, this time equipped with Lubbock or &quot;Shell&quot; atomising-burner combustion chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Developed by Isaac Lubbock of the Shell combustion laboratories in Fulham. Nahum 2004, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Combustion problems ceased to be an obstacle to development of the engine although intensive development was started on all features of the new combustion chambers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The early history of the Whittle jet propulsion Gas Turbine&quot; Air Commodore F. Whittle, James Clayton Memorial Lecture 1945, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, p. 428-430&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point it was clear that Gloster's first airframe would be ready long before Rover could deliver an engine. Unwilling to wait, Whittle cobbled together an engine from spare parts, creating the W.1X (&quot;X&quot; standing for &quot;experimental&quot;) which ran for the first time on 14 December 1940. On 10 December Whittle suffered a nervous breakdown, and left work for a month.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards an application for a US patent was made by Power Jets for an &quot;Aircraft propulsion system and power unit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2404334A/en|title=Aircraft propulsion system and power unit|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The W1X engine powered the E.28/39 for taxi testing on 7 April 1941 near the factory in Gloucester, where it took to the air for two or three short hops of several hundred yards at about six feet from the ground.&lt;ref name =&quot;Whittle quantal DVD&quot;/&gt;

The definitive W.1 of 850&amp;nbsp;[[lbf]] (3.8&amp;nbsp;[[kilonewton|kN]]) thrust ran on 12 April 1941, and on 15 May the W.1-powered E.28/39 took off from Cranwell at 7:40&amp;nbsp;pm, flying for 17&amp;nbsp;minutes and reaching a maximum speed of around 340&amp;nbsp;mph (545&amp;nbsp;km/h). At the end of the flight, Pat Johnson, who had encouraged Whittle for so long said to him, &quot;Frank, it flies.&quot;  Whittle replied, &quot;Well, that's what it was bloody well designed to do, wasn't it?&quot;&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_18/b3881044_mz072.htm Frank Whittle: A Daredevil Who Built Jets], ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek''&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days the aircraft was reaching 370&amp;nbsp;mph (600&amp;nbsp;km/h) at 25,000&amp;nbsp;feet (7,600&amp;nbsp;m), exceeding the performance of the contemporary [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]. Success of the design was now evident; the first example of what was a purely experimental and entirely new engine design was already outperforming one of the best piston engines in the world, an engine that had five years of development and production behind it, and decades of engineering. Nearly every engine company in Britain then started their own crash efforts to catch up with Power Jets.

[[File:Whittle Jet Engine W2-700.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Power Jets W.2|W2/700]] engine, or W.2B/23 as it was known to the Air Ministry. It was the first British production jet engine, powering early models of the [[Gloster Meteor]].]]
In 1941 Rover set up a new laboratory for Whittle's team along with a production line at their unused [[Barnoldswick]] factory, but by late 1941 it was obvious that the arrangement between Power Jets and Rover was not working. Whittle was frustrated by Rover's inability to deliver production-quality parts, as well as with their attitude of engineering superiority, and became increasingly outspoken about the problems. Rover decided to set up secretly a parallel effort with their own engineers at Waterloo Mill, in nearby [[Clitheroe]]. Here [[Adrian Lombard]] started work developing the W.2B into Rover's own production-quality design, dispensing with Whittle's &quot;reverse-flow&quot; combustion chambers and developing a longer but simpler &quot;straight-through&quot; engine instead. This was encouraged by the Air Ministry, who gave Whittle's design the name &quot;B.23&quot;, and Rover's became the &quot;B.26&quot;.

Work on all of the designs continued over the winter of 1941–42. The first W.1A was completed soon after, and on 2 March 1942 the second E.28/39 reached 430&amp;nbsp;mph (690&amp;nbsp;km/h) at 15,000&amp;nbsp;feet (4,600&amp;nbsp;m) on this engine. The next month work on an improved W.2B started under the new name, &quot;W2/500&quot;. In April Whittle learned of Rover's parallel effort, creating discontentment and causing a major crisis in the programme. Work continued, however, and in September the first W2/500 ran for the first time, generating its full design thrust of 1,750&amp;nbsp;lbf (7.8&amp;nbsp;kN) the same day. Work started on a further improvement, the W2/700.

===Rolls-Royce===
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2013}}
Earlier, in January 1940, Whittle had met Dr [[Stanley Hooker]] of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], who in turn introduced Whittle to Rolls-Royce board member and manager of their Derby factory, [[Ernest Walter Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Ernest Hives]] (later Lord Hives). Hooker was in charge of the supercharger division at Rolls-Royce Derby and was a specialist in the mathematics of &quot;[[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]]&quot;.  He had already increased the power of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] piston engine by improving its supercharger.{{sfn|Hooker|2002|p=52}} Such a speciality was naturally suited to the aero-thermodynamics of jet engines in which the optimisation of airflow in compressor, combustion chambers, turbine and jet pipe, is fundamental. Hives agreed to supply key parts to help the project. Also, Rolls-Royce built a compressor test rig which helped Whittle solve the [[Compressor stall|surging]] problems (unstable airflow in the compressor) on the W.2 engine.{{sfn|Hooker|2002|p=68}} In early 1942 Whittle contracted Rolls-Royce for six engines, known as the WR.1, identical to the existing W.1.

When Rolls-Royce became involved, Ray Dorey, the manager of the company's Flight Centre at [[Hucknall Aerodrome|Hucknall airfield]] on the north side of Nottingham, had a Whittle engine installed in the rear of a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber.{{sfn|Hooker|2002|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;Verbal evidence from Flight Test Engineer W R (Bill) Grose who operated the Whittle engine in the Wellington and had previously been involved in ground test running of the Whittle engine at either Lutterworth or Rugby&lt;/ref&gt; The installation was done by Vickers at Weybridge.&lt;ref&gt;Men Of Power, Robert Jackson, Pen % Sword Aviation, Barnsley 2006, {{ISBN|1 84415 427 0}}, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; A flying test-bed enables testing to be done in flight without the aircraft depending on an untried engine for its own propulsion and safety.

The problems between Rover and Power Jets became a &quot;public secret&quot; and late in 1942 [[Spencer Wilks]] of Rover met with Hives and Hooker at the &quot;Swan and Royal&quot; pub, in Clitheroe, near the Barnoldswick factory. By arrangement with the Ministry of Aircraft Production&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%200235.html&lt;/ref&gt; they traded the jet factory at Barnoldswick for Rolls-Royce's [[Rolls-Royce Meteor|tank engine]] factory in Nottingham, sealing the deal with a handshake. The official handover took place on 1 January 1943, although the W.2B contract had already been signed over in December. Rolls-Royce closed Rover's secret parallel plant at [[Clitheroe]] soon after; however, they continued the development of the W.2B/26 that had begun there.

Testing and production ramp-up was immediately accelerated. In December 1942 Rover had tested the W.2B for a total of 37&amp;nbsp;hours, but within the next month Rolls-Royce tested it for 390&amp;nbsp;hours. The W.2B passed its first 100-hour test at full performance of 1,600&amp;nbsp;lbf (7.1&amp;nbsp;kN) on 7 May 1943. The prototype [[Gloster Meteor|Meteor]] airframe was already complete and took to the air on 12 June 1943. Production versions of the engine started rolling off the line in October, first known as the W.2B/23, then the RB.23 (for &quot;Rolls-Barnoldswick&quot;) and eventually became known as the [[Rolls-Royce Welland]]. Barnoldswick was too small for full-scale production and turned back into a pure research facility under Hooker's direction, while a new factory was set up in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Rover's W.2B/26, as the [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]], opened the new line and soon replaced the Welland, allowing the production lines at Barnoldswick to shut down in late 1944.

Despite lengthy delays in their own programme, the [[Luftwaffe]] beat the British efforts into the air by nine months. A lack of cobalt for high-temperature steel alloys meant the German designs were always at risk of overheating and damaging their turbines. The low-grade alloy production versions of the [[Junkers Jumo 004]], designed by Dr. [[Anselm Franz]] and which powered the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] would typically last only 10–25&amp;nbsp;hours (longer with an experienced pilot) before burning out; if it was accelerated too quickly, the compressor would stall and power was immediately lost and sometimes it exploded on their first startup.  Over 200 German pilots were killed during training.  Nevertheless, the Me 262 could fly far faster than allied planes and had very effective firepower.  Although Me 262s were introduced late in the war they shot down 542&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=William |year=1970 |title=Warplanes of the Third Reich |location=New York |publisher=Galahad Books |isbn=0-88365-666-3 |pp=634–638}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyne |first=Walter J. |author-link=Walter J.

The latter, having several stages of rotating blades, each stage increasing the pressure, were potentially more efficient but were much more difficult to develop.  The UK designs also had better materials such as the [[Nimonic]] alloys for turbine blades. Early UK jet engines would run for 150&amp;nbsp;hours between overhauls and had better [[power-to-weight ratio]] and [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] compared with the German designs. By the end of the Second World War, other UK engine companies were working on jet designs based on the Whittle pattern, such as the [[de Havilland Goblin]] and [[de Havilland Ghost|Ghost]] engines. However, the advantages of axial-flow compressors with their higher pressure ratios compared with simpler centrifugal designs led to a transition to axial compressors in the late 1940s, epitomised by the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] series, [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]], [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Olympus]], and others.

===Continued development===
[[File:GE J-31 Turbojet Engine.jpg|thumb|A cutaway [[General Electric J31]] (I-16) turbojet engine based on the [[Power Jets W.1|W.1]]/[[Power Jets W.2|W.2B]]]]

With the W.2 design proceeding smoothly, Whittle was sent to [[Boston]], Massachusetts in mid-1942 to help the [[General Electric]] jet programme.&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; GE, the primary supplier of [[turbocharger]]s in the U.S., was well suited to starting jet production quickly. A combination of the W.2B design and a simple airframe from [[Bell Aircraft]] flew in autumn of 1942 as the [[Bell XP-59A Airacomet]], six months before the flight of the British Meteor.&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle's developments at Power Jets continued, the W.2/700 later being fitted with an [[afterburner]] (&quot;reheat&quot; in British terminology), as well as experimental [[Water injection (engines)|water injection]] to cool the engine and allow higher power settings without melting the turbine. Whittle also turned his attention to the axial-flow (straight-through) engine type as championed by Griffith, designing the L.R.1. Other developments included the use of fans to provide greater mass-flow, either at the front of the engine as in a modern [[turbofan]] or at the rear, which is much less common but somewhat simpler.

Whittle's work had caused a minor revolution within the British engine manufacturing industry, and even before the E.28/39 flew most companies had set up their own research efforts. In 1939, [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] set up a project to develop an axial-flow design as a [[turboprop]] but later re-engineered the design as a pure jet known as the [[Metrovick F.2]].&lt;ref name = Golley180&gt;Golley 1987, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Rolls-Royce had already copied the W.1 to produce the low-rated WR.1 but later stopped work on this project after taking over Rover's efforts.&lt;ref name = Golley187&gt;Golley 1987, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, de Havilland started a jet fighter project, the Spider Crab&amp;nbsp;— later called [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire]]&amp;nbsp;— along with their own engine to power it;&lt;ref&gt;Golley 1987, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Halford]]'s [[de Havilland Goblin|Goblin]] (Halford H.1). [[Armstrong Siddeley]] also developed a more complex axial-flow design with an engineer called Heppner,&lt;ref name = Golley180/&gt; the [[Armstrong Siddeley ASX|ASX]] but reversed Vickers' thinking and later modified it into a turboprop instead, the [[Armstrong Siddeley Python|Python]]. The [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] proposed to combine jet and piston engines but dropped the idea and concentrated on propellor turbines instead.&lt;ref name = Golley180/&gt;

===Nationalisation===
During a demonstration of the E.28/39 to [[Winston Churchill]] in April 1943, Whittle proposed to [[Stafford Cripps]], Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation was the only way to repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better solution would be to nationalise Power Jets only.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;
Whittle believed that he had triggered this decision, but Cripps had already been considering how best to maintain a successful jet programme and act responsibly regarding the state's substantial financial investment, while at the same time wanting to establish a research centre that could use Power Jets' talents, and had come to the conclusion that national interests demanded the setting up of a Government-owned establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, pp. 101, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December Cripps advised Power Jets' directors that the Treasury would not pay more than £100,000 for the company.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

In January 1944 Whittle was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the New Year Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue = 36309 |date = 31 December 1943 |page=17 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he was a [[Group Captain]], having been promoted from [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] in July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36092 |date=13 July 1943 |supp=y |page=3200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month after further negotiations the Ministry made another offer of £135,500 for Power Jets, which was reluctantly accepted after the Ministry refused arbitration on the matter. Since Whittle had already offered to surrender his shares he would receive nothing at all, while Williams and Tinling each received almost £46,800 for their stock, and investors of cash or services had a threefold return on their original investment.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Whittle met with Cripps to object personally to the nationalisation efforts and how they were being handled, but to no avail. The final terms were agreed on 28 March, and Power Jets officially became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd, with [[Roxbee Cox, Baron Kings Norton|Roxbee Cox]] as chairman, [[Hayne Constant|Constant]] of RAE Head of Engineering Division, and Whittle as Chief Technical Advisor. On 5 April 1944, the Ministry sent Whittle an award of only £10,000 for his shares.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

From the end of March, Whittle spent six months in hospital recovering from nervous exhaustion, and resigned from Power Jets (R and D) Ltd in January 1946. In July the company was merged with the gas turbine division of the RAE to form the [[National Gas Turbine Establishment]] (NGTE) at Farnborough, and 16 Power Jets engineers, following Whittle's example, also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Nahum 2004, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==

In 1946 Whittle accepted a post as Technical Advisor on Engine Design and Production to Controller of Supplies (Air); was made Commander, the US [[Legion of Merit]]; and was awarded the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1947. During May 1948 Whittle received an [[Ex gratia|ex-gratia]] award of £100,000 from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors in recognition of his work on the jet engine, and two months later he was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE), Military Division.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38311 |date=4 June 1948 |page=3372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a lecture tour in the US, he again broke down and retired from the RAF on medical grounds on 26 August 1948, leaving with the rank of [[Air Commodore]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38397 |date=3 September 1948 |supp=y |page=4860}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] as a technical advisor on aircraft gas turbines and travelled extensively over the next few years, viewing jet engine developments in the United States, Canada, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. He left BOAC in 1952 and spent the next year working on a biography, ''Jet: The Story of a Pioneer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF4&quot;/&gt; He was awarded the [[Royal Society of Arts]]' [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] that year.

Returning to work in 1953, he accepted a position as a Mechanical Engineering Specialist with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], where he developed a new type of self-powered drill&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF4&quot;/&gt; driven by a turbine running on the lubricating mud that is pumped into the borehole during drilling. Normally a well is drilled by attaching rigid sections of pipe together and powering the cutting head by spinning the pipe from the surface, but Whittle's design removed the need for a strong mechanical connection between the drill and the head frame, allowing for much lighter piping to be used.  He gave the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] in 1954 on ''The Story of Petroleum''.

Turbine drilling is best used for drilling hard rocks at high bit RPMs with diamond impregnated bits, and can be used with an angled drive shaft for directional drilling and horizontal drilling. It competes though with moyno motors and increasingly with rotary steerable systems and is again out of favour.

Whittle left Shell in 1957 to work for [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aero Engines]] who picked up the project in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF4&quot;/&gt; setting up &quot;Bristol Siddeley Whittle Tools&quot; to further develop the concept. In 1966 Rolls-Royce purchased Bristol Siddeley, but the financial pressures and eventual bankruptcy because of cost overruns of the [[Rolls-Royce RB211|RB211]] project led to the slow wind-down and eventual disappearance of Whittle's &quot;turbo-drill&quot;. The concept eventually re-appeared in the west in the late 1980s, imported from Russian designs.  (Russia needed the technology because it lacked high strength [[drill pipe]].)

As part of his [[socialist]] ideals, he proposed that Power Jets be nationalised; in part because he saw that private companies would profit from the technology freely given during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankwhittle.co.uk/content.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=3&amp;docFatherId=1&amp;level=sub|title=Welcome to the Frank Whittle Website|access-date=16 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202242/http://www.frankwhittle.co.uk/content.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=3&amp;docFatherId=1&amp;level=sub|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964 he had deserted his previously socialist beliefs, going so far as to launch a fierce attack on the Labour candidate in Smethwick.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Edgerton|Edgerton, David]], ''Warfare State'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 227, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85636-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor techn. honoris causa, at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]], later part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary doctors at NTNU|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bath.ac.uk/corporate-information/?meta_label_and=graduation&amp;f.Type%7CY=Factsheet|title=Corporate Information|website=www.bath.ac.uk|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Technology) by [[Loughborough University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/degree_days/hon_grads_80to89.html|title=Loughborough University - Honorary Graduates &amp; University Medallists|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Whittle received the ''[[Tony Jannus Award]]'' in 1969 for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.

In 1976, his marriage to Dorothy was dissolved and he married American Hazel S. Hall (&quot;Tommie&quot;). He emigrated to the US and the following year accepted the position of NAVAIR Research Professor at the [[United States Naval Academy]] ([[Annapolis, Maryland]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;RAF4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history_old/whittle4.html |title=Sir Frank Whittle – After the RAF |access-date=19 July 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713020730/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history_old/whittle4.html |archive-date=13 July 2007  }}, RAF history website&lt;/ref&gt; His research concentrated on the [[boundary layer]] before his professorship became part-time from 1978 to 1979. The part-time post enabled him to write a textbook entitled ''Gas turbine aero-thermodynamics: with special reference to aircraft propulsion'', published in 1981.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

Having first met [[Hans von Ohain]] in 1966, Whittle again met him at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in 1978 while von Ohain was working there as the Aero Propulsion Laboratory's Chief Scientist. Initially upset because he believed von Ohain's engine had been developed after seeing Whittle's patent, he eventually became convinced that von Ohain's work was, in fact, independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascho.wpafb.af.mil/encounter/encounter.HTM Verbatim transcript of a two-day conference, ''An Encounter Between the Jet Engine Inventors'', held at Wright-Patterson Air Base 3–4 May 1978] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220010412/http://www.ascho.wpafb.af.mil/encounter/encounter.htm |date=20 December 2007 }} Retrieved: 19 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The two became good friends and often toured the US giving talks together.

In a conversation with Whittle after the war, von Ohain stated that &quot;If you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us. If Hitler or Goering had heard that there is a man in England who flies 500&amp;nbsp;mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development, it is likely that World War II would not have come into being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Conner, ''Hans von Ohain: Elegance in Flight'' (Reston, Virginia: American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Whittle was appointed a member of the [[Order of Merit]] (Commonwealth). He was made a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]], and of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]],&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; and in 1991 he and von Ohain were awarded the [[Charles Stark Draper Prize]] for their work on turbojet engines.

Whittle became an atheist by degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jet: Frank Whittle and the Invention of the Jet Engine|author=John Golley|publisher=Eloy Gutierrez|year=2010|isbn=9781907472008|page=34|quote=Although he had occasionally cut Church Parade, he had once held very strong religious beliefs, but these had eroded to such an extent that he had come to regard himself as an atheist. &quot;By degrees&quot;, he said &quot;I was forced to the conclusion that my beliefs were inconsistent with scientific teaching. Once the seeds of doubt were sown the whole structure of my former religious beliefs rapidly collapsed, and I swung to the other extreme.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle died of lung cancer on 9 August 1996, at his home in [[Columbia, Maryland]]. He was cremated in America and his ashes were flown to England where they were placed in a memorial in a church in [[Cranwell]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Whittle quantal DVD&quot;/&gt; Lady Hazel Whittle died on 30 July 2007 aged 91.

According to Averroes, there are two methods of teaching virtue to citizens; persuasion and coercion.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Persuasion is the more natural method consisting of rhetorical, dialectical and demonstrative methods; sometimes, however, coercion is necessary for those not amenable to persuasion, e.g. enemies of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Therefore, he justifies war as a last resort, which he also supports using Quranic arguments.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Consequently, he argues that a ruler should have both wisdom and courage, which are needed for governance and defense of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=107}}

Like Plato, Averroes calls for women to share with men in the administration of the state, including participating as soldiers, philosophers and rulers.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=110}} He regrets that contemporaneous Muslim societies limited the public role of women; he says this limitation is harmful to the state's well-being.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}

Averroes also accepted Plato's ideas of the deterioration of the ideal state. He cites examples from Islamic history when the [[Rashidun caliphate]]—which in Sunni tradition represented the ideal state led by &quot;rightly guided caliphs&quot;—became a dynastic state under [[Muawiyah]], founder of the [[Umayyad dynasty]]. He also says the Almoravid and the Almohad empires started as ideal, shariah-based states but then deteriorated into [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]].{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=112–114}}

=== Diversity of Islamic law ===
In his tenure as judge and jurist, Averroes for the most part ruled and gave fatwas according to the [[Maliki school]] of Islamic law which was dominant in Al-Andalus and the western Islamic world during his time.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|pp=195–196}} However, he frequently acted as &quot;his own man&quot;, including sometimes rejecting the &quot;consensus of the people of [[Medina]]&quot; argument that is one of the traditional Maliki position.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=195}} In ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid'', one of his major contributions to the field of Islamic law, he not only describes the differences between various school of Islamic laws but also tries to theoretically explain the reasons for the difference and why they are inevitable.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|pp=191–192}} Even though all the schools of Islamic law are ultimately rooted in the Quran and hadith, there are &quot;causes which necessitate differences&quot; (''al-asbab al-lati awjabat al-ikhtilaf'').{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=192}}{{sfn|Ibn Rushd|2017|p=11}} They include differences in interpreting scripture in a general or specific sense,{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=204}} in interpreting scriptural commands as obligatory or merely recommended, or prohibitions as discouragement or total prohibition,{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=199}} as well as ambiguities in the meaning of words or expressions.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|pp=204–205}} Averroes also writes that the application of ''[[qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy) could give rise to different legal opinion because jurists might disagree on the applicability of certain analogies{{sfn|Dutton|1994|pp=201–202}} and different analogies might contradict each other.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=205}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=116}}

== Natural philosophy ==
=== Astronomy ===
As did [[Avempace]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], Averroes criticizes the [[Ptolemaic system]] using philosophical arguments and rejects the use of [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentrics]] and [[epicycles]] to explain the apparent motions of the moon, the sun and the planets. He argued that those objects move uniformly in a strictly circular motion around the earth, following Aristotelian principles.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}} He postulates that there are three type of planetary motions; those that can be seen with the naked eye, those that requires instruments to observe and those that can only be known by philosophical reasoning.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}}  Averroes argues that the occasional opaque colors of the moon are caused by variations in its thickness; the thicker parts receive more light from the Sun—and therefore emit more light—than the thinner parts.{{sfn|Ariew|2011|p=193}} This explanation was used up to the seventeenth century by the European [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] to account for [[Galileo]]'s observations of [[List of lunar features|spots]] on the moon's surface, until the Scholastics such as Antoine Goudin in 1668 conceded that the observation was more likely caused by [[List of mountains on the Moon|mountains]] on the moon.{{sfn|Ariew|2011|pp=194–195}} He and Ibn Bajja observed [[sunspot]]s, which they thought were [[Transit of Venus|transits of Venus]] and [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury]] between the Sun and the Earth.{{sfn|Vernet|Samsó|1996|p=264}} In 1153 he conducted astronomical observations in Marrakesh, where he observed the star [[Canopus]] (Arabic: ''Suhayl'') which was invisible in the latitude of his native Spain. He used this observation to support [[Spherical Earth#Aristotle|Aristotle's argument]] for the [[spherical Earth]].{{sfn|Vernet|Samsó|1996|p=264}}

Averroes was aware that Arabic and Andalusian astronomers of his time focused on &quot;mathematical&quot; astronomy, which enabled accurate predictions through calculations but did not provide a detailed physical explanation of how the universe worked.{{sfn|Vernet|Samsó|1996|p=266}} According to him, &quot;the astronomy of our time offers no truth, but only agrees with the calculations and not with what exists.&quot;{{sfn|Agutter|Wheatley|2008|p=44}} He attempted to reform astronomy to be reconciled with physics, especially the physics of Aristotle. His long commentary of Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' describes the principles of his attempted reform, but later in his life he declared that his attempts had failed.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He confessed that he had not enough time or knowledge to reconcile the observed planetary motions with Aristotelian principles.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}} In addition, he did not know the works of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Callippus]], and so he missed the context of some of Aristotle's astronomical works.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}} However, his works influenced astronomer [[Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji]] (d. 1204) who adopted most of his reform principles and did succeed in proposing an early astronomical system based on Aristotelian physics.{{sfn|Vernet|Samsó|1996|pp=266–267}}

=== Physics ===
In physics, Averroes did not adopt the [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] method that was being developed by [[Al-Biruni]] in the Islamic world and is closer to today's physics.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} Rather, he was—in the words of historian of science [[Ruth Glasner]]—a &quot;exegetical&quot; scientist who produced new theses about nature through discussions of previous texts, especially the writings of Aristotle.{{sfn|Glasner|2009|p=4}} because of this approach, he was often depicted as an unimaginative follower of Aristotle, but Glasner argues that Averroes' work introduced highly original theories of physics, especially his elaboration of Aristotle's ''[[minima naturalia]]'' and on motion as ''[[forma fluens]]'', which were taken up in the west and are important to the overall development of physics.{{sfn|Glasner|2009|pp=1–2}} Averroes also proposed a definition of force as &quot;the rate at which work is done in changing the kinetic condition of a material body&quot;—a definition close to that of [[Power (physics)|power]] in today's physics.{{sfn|Agutter|Wheatley|2008|p=45}}

=== Psychology ===
[[File:Bnf lat16151 f22.jpg|thumb|alt=Page from a book in Latin with dense text|''The Long Commentary on Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]], French Manuscript, third quarter of the 13th century]]

Averroes expounds his thoughts on psychology in his three commentaries on Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]''.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} Averroes is interested in explaining the human intellect using philosophical methods and by interpreting Aristotle's ideas.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} His position on the topic changed throughout his career as his thoughts developed.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} In his short commentary, the first of the three works, Averroes follows [[Ibn Bajja]]'s theory that something called the &quot;[[Passive intellect|material intellect]]&quot; stores specific images that a person encounters.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=189–190}} These images serve as basis for the &quot;unification&quot; by the universal &quot;[[agent intellect]]&quot;, which, once it happens, allow a person to gain universal knowledge about that concept.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} In his middle commentary, Averroes moves towards the ideas of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, saying the agent intellect gives humans the power of universal understanding, which is the material intellect.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} Once the person has sufficient empirical encounters with a certain concept, the power activates and gives the person universal knowledge{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} (see also [[logical induction]]).

In his last commentary—called the ''Long Commentary''—he proposes another theory, which becomes known as the theory of &quot;the [[unity of the intellect]]&quot;. In it, Averroes argues that there is only one material intellect, which is the same for all humans and is unmixed with human body.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=191}} To explain how different individuals can have different thoughts, he uses a concept he calls ''fikr''—known as ''cogitatio'' in Latin—a process that happens in human brains and contains not universal knowledge but &quot;active consideration of particular things&quot; the person has encountered.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=191}} This theory attracted controversy when Averroes' works entered Christian Europe; in 1229 [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a detailed critique titled ''On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists''.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}}{{sfn|Hasse|2014|loc=Averroes' Unicity Thesis}}

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Face and shoulder portrait of a man|[[Galen]], a prominent 2nd century physician and author whose medical theories influenced Averroes]]
While his works in medicine indicate an in-depth theoretical knowledge in medicine of his time, he likely had limited expertise as a practitioner, and declared in one of his works that he had not &quot;practiced much apart from myself, my relatives or my friends.&quot;{{sfn|Chandelier|2018|p=163}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|2000|p=27–28}} He did serve as a royal physician, but his qualification and education was mostly theoretical.{{sfn|Arnaldez|2000|p=27–28}} For the most part, Averroes' medical work ''Al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb'' follows the medical doctrine of Galen, an influential Greek physician and author from the 2nd century, which was based on [[Humorism|the four humors]]—blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm, whose balance is necessary for the health of the human body.{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|p=378}} Averroes' original contributions include his observations on the retina: he might have been the first to recognize that [[retina]] was the part of the eye responsible for sensing light, rather than the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] as was commonly thought.{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|p=378}} Modern scholars dispute whether this is what he meant it his ''Kulliyat'', but Averroes also stated a similar observation in his commentary to Aristotle's ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'': &quot;the innermost of the coats of the eye [the retina] must necessarily receive the light from the humors of the eye [the lens], just like the humors receive the light from air.&quot;{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|pp=378–379}}

Another of his departure from Galen and the medical theories of the time is his description of [[stroke]] as produced by the brain and caused by an obstruction of the arteries from the heart to the brain.{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|p=379}} This explanation is closer to the modern understanding of the disease compared to that of Galen, which attributes it to the obstruction between heart and the periphery.{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|p=379}} He was also the first to describe the signs and symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] in his ''Kulliyat'', although he did not give the disease a name.{{sfn|Belen|Bolay|2009|pp=379–380}}

== Legacy ==
{{Main|Averroism}}
[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Black-and-white portrait of a bearded man with turban|[[Maimonides]], one of the early Jewish scholars who enthusiastically received Averroes' works]]
=== In Jewish tradition ===
[[Maimonides]] (d. 1204) was among early Jewish scholars who received Averroes' works enthusiastically, saying he &quot;received lately everything Averroes had written on the works of Aristotle&quot; and that Averroes &quot;was extremely right&quot;.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} Thirteenth-century Jewish writers, including [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]] in his work ''Opinion of the Philosophers'', [[Judah ibn Solomon Cohen]] in his ''Search for Wisdom'' and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]],  relied heavily on Averroes' texts.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} In 1232, [[Joseph Ben Abba Mari]] translated Averroes' commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]''; this was the first Jewish translation of a complete work. In 1260 [[Moses ibn Tibbon]] published the translation of almost all of Averroes' commentaries and some of his works on medicine.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} Jewish Averroism peaked in the fourteenth century;{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} Jewish writers of this time who translated or were influenced by Averroes include [[Kalonymus ben Kalonymus]] of [[Arles]], France, [[Todros Todrosi]] of Arles and [[Gersonides]] of [[Languedoc]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=132–133}}

=== In Latin tradition ===
Averroes' main influence on the [[Christian west]] was through his extensive commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=131}} After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], western Europe fell into a cultural decline that resulted in the loss of nearly all of the intellectual legacy of the Classical Greek scholars, including Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=129}} Averroes' commentaries, which were translated into Latin and entered western Europe in the thirteenth century, provided an expert account of Aristotle's legacy and made them available again.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} The influence of his commentaries led to Averroes being referred to simply as &quot;The Commentator&quot; rather than by name in Latin Christian writings.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}  He has been sometimes described as the &quot;father of free thought and unbelief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillaume|first=Alfred|title=The Legacy of Islam|year=1945|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bratton|first=Fred|title=Maimonides, medieval modernist|url=https://archive.org/details/maimonidesmediev00brat|url-access=registration|year=1967|publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;father of rationalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=John|title=Andalucía : a cultural history|year=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-537610-4|pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Scot]] (1175 – c. 1232) was the first Latin translator of Averroes who translated the long commentaries of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''Metaphysics'', ''On the Soul'' and ''On the Heavens'', as well as multiple middle and short commentaries, starting in 1217 in [[Paris]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133–134}} Following this, European authors such as [[Hermannus Alemannus]], [[William de Luna]] and [[Armengaud of Montpellier]] translated Averroes' other works, sometimes with help from Jewish authors.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} Soon after, Averroes' works propagated among Christian scholars in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} His writing attracted a strong circle of followers known as the [[Latin Averroism|Latin Averroists]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} Paris and [[Padua]] were major centers of Latin Averroism, and its prominent thirteenth-century leaders included [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Boethius of Dacia]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}}

Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church reacted against the spread of Averroism. In 1270, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]] [[Étienne Tempier]] issued [[Condemnations of 1270|a condemnation]] against 15 doctrines—many of which were Aristotelian or Averroist—that he said were in conflict with the doctrines of the church. In 1277, at the request of [[Pope John XXI]], Tempier issued another condemnation, this time targeting 219 theses drawn from many sources, mainly the teachings of Aristotle and Averroes.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134–135}}

[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli 004a.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a man (Thomas Aquinas) sitting with another man (Averroes) lying on his feet|The ''Triumph of Saint Thomas Aquinas over Averroes'' by Benozzo Gozzoli, depicting [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (top center), a major Averroes critic, &quot;triumphing&quot; over Averroes (bottom), depicted at the feet of Aquinas]]
Averroes received a mixed reception from other Catholic thinkers; [[Thomas Aquinas]], a leading Catholic thinker of the thirteenth century, relied extensively on Averroes' interpretation of Aristotle but disagreed with him on many points.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=138}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} For example, he wrote a detailed attack on Averroes' theory that all humans share the same intellect.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=192}} He also opposed Averroes on the eternity of the universe and [[divine providence]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=140}}

The Catholic Church's condemnations of 1270 and 1277, and the detailed critique by Aquinas weakened the spread of Averroism in Latin [[Christendom]],{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=135}} though it maintained a following until the sixteenth century, when European thought began to diverge from Aristotelianism.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} Leading Averroists in the following centuries included [[John of Jandun]] and [[Marsilius of Padua]] (fourteenth century), [[Gaetano da Thiene (philosopher)|Gaetano da Thiene]] and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] (fifteenth century), and [[Agostino Nifo]] and [[Marcantonio Zimara]] (sixteenth century).{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=137–138}}

=== In Islamic tradition ===
Averroes had no major influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}} Part of the reason was geography; Averroes lived in Spain, the extreme west of the Islamic civilization far from the centers of Islamic intellectual traditions.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} Also, his philosophy may not have appealed to Islamic scholars of his time.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} His focus on Aristotle's works was outdated in the twelfth-century Muslim world, which had already scrutinized Aristotle since the ninth century and by now was engaging deeply with newer schools of thought, especially that of Avicenna.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} In the nineteenth century, Muslim thinkers begin to engage with the works of Averroes again.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}} By this time, there was a cultural renaissance called ''[[Al-Nahda]]'' (&quot;reawakening&quot;) in the Arabic-speaking world and the works of Averroes were seen as inspiration to modernize the Muslim intellectual tradition.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}}

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Averroes closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a man looking over the shoulder of a man writing in front of him|Averroes, detail of the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]]]]

References to Averroes appear in the popular culture of both the western and Muslim world. The poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by the Italian writer [[Dante Alighieri]], completed in 1320, depicts Averroes, &quot;who made the Great Commentary&quot;, along with other non-Christian Greek and Muslim thinkers, in [[Inferno (Dante)#First Circle (Limbo)|Limbo]] around [[Saladin]].{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=138}} The prolog of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (1387) by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] lists Averroes among other medical authorities known in Europe at the time.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=94}} Averroes is depicted in [[Raphael]]'s 1501 fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' that decorates the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], which features seminal figures of philosophy. In the painting, Averroes wears a green robe and a turban, and peers out from behind [[Pythagoras]], who is shown writing a book.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=95}}

A 1947 short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], &quot;[[Averroes's Search]]&quot; ({{lang-es|La Busca de Averroes}}), features his attempts to understand [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Poetics'']] within a culture that lacks a tradition of live theatrical performance.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2017|p=28}} In the afterwords of the story, Borges comments, &quot;I felt that [the story] mocked me, foiled me, thwarted me. I felt that Averroës, trying to imagine what a play is without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd than I, trying to imagine Averroës yet with no more material than a few snatches from Renan, [[Edward William Lane|Lane]], and [[Miguel Asín Palacios|Asín Palacios]].&quot;{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2017|p=29}} Averroes is also the hero of the 1997 Egyptian movie ''[[Destiny (1997 film)|Destiny]]'' by [[Youssef Chahine]], made partly in commemoration of the 800th anniversary of his death.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xiv}} The plant genus ''[[Averrhoa]]'' (whose members include the [[starfruit]] and the [[Averrhoa bilimbi|bilimbi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Quattrocchi1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Umberto Quattrocchi|title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A68qyOyhOdkC&amp;pg=PA241|date=29 November 1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2673-8|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[lunar crater]] [[Ibn-Rushd (crater)|ibn Rushd]], and the [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] are named after him.

Geographically, the Arabian Peninsula includes [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), and [[Yemen]], as well as the southern portions of [[Iraq]] and [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;Geopolitics of the World System – Page 337, Saul Bernard Cohen – 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Peninsula, plus [[Bahrain]], the [[Socotra Governorate|Socotra Archipelago]], and other nearby [[island]]s form a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] region called '''Arabia''', which is the [[list of countries without rivers|largest region in the world without any river]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.graphicmaps.com/countries-with-no-rivers Which Countries Don't Have Rivers?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabian Peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the [[Red Sea]] between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the [[Red Sea]] to the west and southwest, the [[Persian Gulf]] to the northeast, the [[Levant]] to the north and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast. The peninsula plays a critical [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] role in the [[Arab world]] due to its vast reserves of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]].

Before the modern era, the region was divided into four distinct regions: the [[Najd|Central Plateau]] (Najd or [[Al-Yamama]]), the [[South Arabia|Indian Ocean Coast]] (South Arabia or [[Hadhramaut]]), the [[Eastern Arabia|Persian Gulf Coast]] (Eastern Arabia or Al-Bahrain), and the [[Hejaz|Red Sea Coast]] (Hejaz or [[Tihamah]]). [[Eastern Arabia]] consists of the entire coastal strip of the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Hejaz]] and [[Najd]] make up most of Saudi Arabia. [[South Arabia]] consists of Yemen plus parts of Oman ([[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]]) and Saudi Arabia ([['Asir Province|'Asir]], [[Jazan Province|Jizan]], and [[Najran Province|Najran]]).

[[File:Arabian peninsula definition.PNG|thumb|left|The geographical and political boundaries of the Arabian Peninsula]]

The Arabian Peninsula is located in the continent of Asia and bounded by (clockwise) the [[Persian Gulf]] on the northeast, the [[Strait of Hormuz]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the southeast, the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Guardafui Channel]] and Somali Sea on the south, the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] Strait on the southwest and the [[Red Sea]], which is located on the southwest and west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Arabia |encyclopedia = Britannica Online Encyclopedia |access-date=2011-05-21 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31551/Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern portion of the peninsula merges with the [[Syrian Desert]] with no clear borderline, although the northern boundary of the peninsula is generally considered to be the northern borders of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia&quot; /&gt;

The most prominent feature of the peninsula is [[desert]], but in the southwest, there are mountain ranges, which receive greater rainfall than the rest of the peninsula. [[Harrat ash Shaam]] is a large volcanic field that extends from northwestern Arabia into [[Jordan]] and southern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Y. |title=A transition from strombolian to phreatomagmatic activity induced by a lava flow damming water in a valley|journal= Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research |date=1 January 2007|volume= 159|issue=1–3|pages=267–284 |doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2006.06.015|bibcode=2007JVGR..159..267W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political boundaries===
[[File:Arabian Peninsula Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|The constituent countries of Arabia]]

The Peninsula's constituent countries are (clockwise from north to south) [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) on the east, [[Oman]] on the southeast, [[Yemen]] on the south, and [[Saudi Arabia]] at the center. The island country of [[Bahrain]] lies just off the east coast of the Peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Arabia&quot; /&gt; Due to Yemen's jurisdiction over the [[Socotra Governorate|Socotra Archipelago]], the Peninsula's geopolitical outline faces the [[Guardafui Channel]] and the Somali Sea to the south.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Rob. &quot;The Continuing Conundrum of the Somali Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone.&quot; The International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law 30.2 (2015): 305-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) form the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC).&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Alsharhan, Z. A. Rizk, A. E. M. Nairn [et al.], 2001, Waterology of an Arid Region, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers the greater part of the Peninsula. The majority of the population of the Peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The Peninsula contains the world's largest reserves of oil. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are economically the wealthiest in the region. [[Qatar]], a small peninsula in the Persian Gulf on the larger peninsula, is home to the [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] television station [[Al Jazeera]] and its English-language subsidiary [[Al Jazeera English]]. [[Kuwait]], on the border with Iraq, is an important country strategically, forming one of the main staging grounds for coalition forces mounting the [[United States]]-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

Though historically lightly populated, political Arabia is noted for a high population growth rate – as the result of both very strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years. In 2014, the estimated population of the Arabian Peninsula was 77,983,936 (including expatriates).&lt;ref name=yam&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html|title=The World Fact book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=2008-08-12 |date=2007-08-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080812233855/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html| archivedate= 12 August 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabian Peninsula is known for having one of the most uneven adult sex ratios in the world with females in some regions (especially the east) constituting only a quarter of vicenarians and tricenarians.&lt;ref&gt;Alrouh, Hekmat, Awatef Ismail, and Sohaila Cheema. &quot;Demographic and health indicators in Gulf Cooperation Council nations with an emphasis on Qatar.&quot; Journal of Local and Global Health Perspectives (2013): p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologically, this region is perhaps more appropriately called the Arabian subcontinent because it lies on a [[tectonic plate]] of its own, the [[Arabian Plate]], which has been moving incrementally away from the rest of Africa (forming the Red Sea) and north, toward Asia, into the [[Eurasian Plate]] (forming the [[Zagros Mountains]]). The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]] near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the best-preserved [[ophiolite]] on Earth, the [[Semail Ophiolite]], lies exposed in the mountains of the UAE and northern Oman.

Charles's eldest son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], led a rebellion against James II, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] on 6 July 1685, captured and executed. James was eventually dethroned in 1688, in the course of the [[Glorious Revolution]].

Looking back on Charles's reign, Tories tended to view it as a time of benevolent monarchy whereas Whigs perceived it as a terrible [[despotism]]. Today it is possible to assess him without the taint of partisanship, and he is seen as more of a lovable rogue—in the words of his contemporary [[John Evelyn]], &quot;a prince of many virtues and many great imperfections, debonair, easy of access, not bloody or cruel&quot;.{{sfn|Miller|1991|pp=382–383}} [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], wrote more lewdly of Charles:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Restless he rolls from whore to whore
A merry monarch, scandalous and poor.{{sfn|Miller|1991|p=95}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Professor [[Ronald Hutton]] summarises the polarised historiography:
{{quote|For the past hundred years, books on Charles II have been sharply divided into two categories. Academic historians have concentrated mainly on his activities as a statesman and emphasised his duplicity, self-indulgence, poor judgement and lack of an aptitude for business or for stable and trustworthy government. Non-academic authors have concentrated mainly on his social and cultural world, emphasising his charm, affability, worldliness, tolerance, turning him into one of the most popular of all English monarchs in novels, plays and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ronald |last=Hutton|title=A Gambling Man: Charles II and the Restoration|journal=History Today|date=December 2009|volume=59|issue=12|pages=55+}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutton says Charles was a popular king in his own day and a &quot;legendary figure&quot; in British history.
{{quote|Other kings had inspired more respect, but perhaps only Henry VIII had endeared himself to the popular imagination as much as this one. He was the playboy monarch, naughty but nice, the hero of all who prized urbanity, tolerance, good humour, and the pursuit of pleasure above the more earnest, sober, or material virtues.{{sfn|Hutton|1989|p=446}}}}

Biographer [[Hilaire Belloc]] states:
{{quote|Charles was universally beloved, beloved not only by the crowd of individuals with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but thoroughly popular with the mass of his subjects and particularly with the poorer populace of London who knew him best.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Hilaire|last=Belloc|title=Charles II: The Last Rally|origyear=1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nQlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146|year=2003|page=146|isbn=9781605700007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Charles, a patron of the arts and sciences, founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] and supported the [[Royal Society]], a scientific group whose early members included [[Robert Hooke]], [[Robert Boyle]] and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. He was the personal patron of Sir [[Christopher Wren]], the architect who helped rebuild London after the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] and who constructed the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], which Charles founded as a home for retired soldiers in 1682. As a patron of education, he founded a number of schools, including the [[Royal Mathematical School]] in London and [[The King's Hospital]] in Dublin, as well as the Erasmus Smith schools in various parts of Ireland.

The anniversary of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] (which was also Charles's birthday)—29 May—was recognised in England until the mid-nineteenth century as [[Oak Apple Day]], after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out.{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=118}} Charles II is [[Cultural depictions of Charles II of England|depicted extensively in art, literature and media]]. [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]], are named after him.

'''Saracens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ær|ə|s|ən}}) were [[Arab Muslims]] as referred to by Christian writers in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. The term's meaning evolved during its history. In the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], Greek and Latin writings used the term to refer to the people who lived in desert areas in and near the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]], and in [[Arabia Deserta]].{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} In Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], the term came to be associated with [[tribes of Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377754/Saracens |title=Saracen |encyclopedia=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |year=2012 |access-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Saracen |archive-date=2018 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest source mentioning ''Saracen'' dates to the 7th century. It was found in [[Teaching of Jacob| Doctrina Jacobi]], a commentary that discussed the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Déroche |first1=Vincent |last2=Dagron |first2=Gilbert |title=Doctrina Jacobi nuper Baptizati, &quot;Juifs et chrétiens dans l'Orient du VIIe siècle&quot; |date=1991 |pages=17–248 |edition=Edition of the Greek text with French translation}}; {{cite web |last1=Kirby |first1=Peter |title=External references to Islam |url=http://www.christianorigins.com/islamrefs.html |website=External References to Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century, ''Saracen'' had become synonymous with ''Muslim'' in [[Medieval Latin]] literature. Such expansion in the meaning of the term had begun centuries earlier among the [[Byzantine Greeks]], as evidenced in documents from the 8th century.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Kahf|1999|p=181}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=96}} In the Western languages before the 16th century, ''Saracen'' was commonly used to refer to Muslim Arabs, and the words ''Muslim'' and ''Islam'' were generally not used (with a few isolated exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tolan |first=John V. |author-link=John V.

The [[Latin-language|Latin]] term ''Saraceni''  is of unknown original meaning. There are claims of it being derived from the Semitic [[triliteral root]] ''šrq'' &quot;east&quot; and ''šrkt'' &quot;tribe, confederation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isabel |last=Toral-Niehoff |chapter=Saraca |title=Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World |volume=14 |editor-first=Hubert |editor-last=Cancik |editor2-first=Helmuth |editor2-last=Schneider |editor2-link=Helmuth Schneider |editor3-first=Christine F. |editor3-last=Salazar |editor4-first=David E. |editor4-last=Orton |editor4-link=David E.

[[Ptolemy]]'s [[2nd-century]] work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', describes ''Sarakēnḗ'' ({{lang-grc|Σαρακηνή}}) as a region in the northern [[Sinai Peninsula]].{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} Ptolemy also mentions a people called the ''Sarakēnoí'' ({{lang-grc|οἱ Σαρακηνοί}}) living in the northwestern [[Arabian Peninsula]] (near neighbor to the Sinai).{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} [[Eusebius]] in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical history]]'' narrates an account wherein [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]] mentions Saracens in a letter while describing the  persecution of Christians by the Roman emperor [[Decius]]: &quot;Many were, in the Arabian mountain, enslaved by the barbarous 'sarkenoi'.&quot;{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} The ''[[Augustan History]]'' also refers to an attack by ''Saraceni'' on [[Pescennius Niger]]'s army in [[Egypt]] in 193, but provides little information as to identifying them.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=457}}

Both [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and Uranius mention three distinct peoples in Arabia during the first half of the third century: the ''Taeni'', the ''Saraceni'', and the ''Arabes''.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} The ''Taeni'', later identified with the [[Arabs|Arab people]] called ''[[Tayy]]'', were located around [[Khaybar]] (an oasis north of Medina) and also in an area stretching up to the [[Euphrates]]. The ''Saraceni'' were placed north of them.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}} These Saracens, located in the northern [[Hejaz]], were described as people with a certain military ability who were opponents of the [[Roman Empire]] and who were classified by the Romans as [[barbarian]]s.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}}

The Saracens are described as forming the ''[[equites]]'' (heavy cavalry) from [[Phoenicia]] and [[Thamud]].{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=464}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=465}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=466}} In one document, the defeated enemies of [[Diocletian]]'s campaign in the [[Syrian Desert]] are described as Saracens.

==Medieval usage==
[[File:Saracens Europe01 full.jpg|thumb|Saracens landing on a coast, 915]] 
No later than the early fifth century, Christian writers began to equate Saracens with Arabs. Saracens were associated with [[Ishmaelites]] (descendants of [[Abraham]]'s older son [[Ishmael]]) in some strands of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic genealogical thinking. The writings of [[Jerome]] (d. 420) are the earliest known version of the claim that Ishmaelites chose to be called Saracens in order to identify with Abraham's &quot;free&quot; wife [[Sarah]], rather than as Hagarenes, which would have highlighted their association with Abraham's &quot;slave woman&quot; [[Hagar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubenstein |first=Jay |author-link=Jay Rubenstein |date=1 November 2011 |title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=978-0-465-01929-8 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KB-VaqOddn8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was popular during the Middle Ages, but derives more from Paul's allegory in the New Testament letter to the Galatians than from historical data. The name ''Saracen'' was not indigenous among the populations so described but was applied to them by Greco-Roman historians based on Greek place names.{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=505}}{{sfn|Retsö|2003|p=506}}

As the Middle Ages progressed, usage of the term in the Latin West changed, but its connotation remained negative, associated with opponents of Christianity, and its exact definition is unclear.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=246}} In an 8th-century polemical work, [[John of Damascus]] criticized the Saracens as followers of a false prophet and &quot;forerunner[s] to the Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotark.org/upload/TheFountofKnowledge.pdf |title=The Fount of Knowledge |work=Gotiska Ärkestiftet av de Sanna ortodoxt kristna |date=28 April 2012 |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926212543/http://www.gotark.org/upload/TheFountofKnowledge.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2013 |last=Damascene |first=John |author-link=John Damascene |translator-last=Warwick |translator-first=G.

By the 12th century, Medieval Europeans used the term ''Saracen'' as both an ethnic and religious marker.{{sfn|Daniel|1979|p=53}}{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=334}} In some Medieval literature, Saracens were equated with Muslims in general and described as dark-skinned, while Christians lighter-skinned. An example is in ''[[The King of Tars]]'', a medieval romance.{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=231}}{{sfn|Heng|2012|p=422}}&lt;ref name=&quot;tars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/crusadesproject/tars.htm |title=The King of Tars |work=The Crusades Project |publisher=[[University of Rochester]] |date=28 April 2012 |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716175706/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/crusadesproject/tars.htm |archive-date=16 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', an [[Old French]] 11th-century heroic poem, refers to the black skin of Saracens as their only exotic feature.{{sfn|Kahf|1999|p=31}}

The term ''Saracen'' remained in widespread use in the West as a synonym for &quot;Muslim&quot; until the 18th century. When the [[Age of Discovery]] led to it becoming gradually obsolete and referred to Muslims as &quot;Mohammedan&quot; which came into usage from the 1600 onwards. However &quot;Saracen&quot; continued to be used until the 19th century. The Victorian era phrase &quot;[[Indo-Saracenic Architecture]]&quot; is an example of this.

In the [[Wiltshire dialect]], the meaning of &quot;Sarsen&quot; (Saracen) was eventually extended to refer to anything regarded as non-Christian, whether Muslim or pagan. From that derived the still current term &quot;[[Sarsen]]&quot; (a shortening of &quot;Saracen stone&quot;), denoting the kind of stone used by the builders of [[Stonehenge]] &lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bedlam ''[http://www.stonehenge.tv/stones.html The stones of Stonehenge]''&lt;/ref&gt; - long predating Islam and all monotheistic religions.

[[Image:John-Sherman-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[John Sherman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[List of United States Senators from Ohio|Ohio]]), the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act]]
{{Competition law}}
The '''Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890'''&lt;ref&gt;Officially re-designated as the &quot;Sherman Act&quot; by Congress in the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act|Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976]], (Public Law 94-435, Title 3, Sec. 305(a), 90 Stat. 1383 at [[s:Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 90 Part 1.djvu/1447|p. 1397]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ({{USStat|26|209}}, {{usc|15|1|7}}) is a [[United States antitrust law]] that prescribes the rule of free competition among those engaged in commerce that was passed by Congress under the [[presidency of Benjamin Harrison]]. It is named for Senator [[John Sherman]], its principal author.

The Sherman Act broadly prohibits 1) anticompetitive agreements and 2) unilateral conduct that monopolizes or attempts to monopolize the relevant market. The Act authorizes the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to bring [[Lawsuit|suits]] to [[enjoin]] (i.e. prohibit) conduct violating the Act, and additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the Act to bring suits for [[treble damages]] (i.e. three times as much money in damages as the violation cost them). Over time, the federal courts have developed a body of law under the Sherman Act making certain types of anticompetitive conduct per se illegal, and subjecting other types of conduct to case-by-case analysis regarding whether the conduct unreasonably restrains trade.

The law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|title=Sherman AntiTrust Act, and Analysis|date=12 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111118040849/http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|archivedate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Innocent monopoly&quot;, or [[monopoly]] achieved solely by merit, is legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cseres2005&quot;&gt;&quot;This focus of U.S. competition law, on protection of competition rather than competitors, is not necessarily the only possible focus or purpose of competition law. For example, it has also been said that competition law in the European Union (EU) tends to protect the competitors in the marketplace, even at the expense of market efficiencies and consumers.&quot;&lt;  {{cite book|title=Competition law and consumer protection|last=Cseres|first=Katalin Judit|year=2005|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041123800|pages=291–293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3IOROCcVacC|access-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512183804/http://books.google.com/books?id=y3IOROCcVacC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0|archivedate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In ''[[Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan]]'' 506 U.S. 447 (1993) the Supreme Court said:

{{cquote|The purpose of the [Sherman] Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpectrumSports&quot;&gt;{{ussc|name=Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan|link=|volume=506|page=447|pin=458|year=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to its authors, it was not intended to impact market gains obtained by honest means, by benefiting the consumers more than the competitors. Senator [[George Hoar]] of [[Massachusetts]], another author of the Sherman Act, said the following:

[a person] who merely by superior skill and intelligence...got the whole business because nobody could do it as well as he could was not a monopolist...(but was if) it involved something like the use of means which made it impossible for other persons to engage in fair competition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsssAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA279|title=Bills and Debates in Congress Relating to Trusts: Fiftieth Congress to Fifty-seventh Congress, First Session, Inclusive|first1=United States|last1=Congress|first2=James Arthur|last2=Finch|date=26 March 2018|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409142100/https://books.google.com/books?id=OsssAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QI5PFBZPn_&amp;sig=0mccC_vXBFDUc9O8BsmPW2x6HAk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VoXFTs28OoObtwej1PWTCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|archivedate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

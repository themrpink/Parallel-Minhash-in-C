A '''suspension bridge''' is a type of [[bridge]] in which the deck (the load-bearing portion) is hung below suspension [[wire rope|cables]] on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo – Architect, Philosopher, and Iron Chain Bridge Builder] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf |date=25 May 2014 }} by Manfred Gerner. Thimphu: Center for Bhutan Studies 2007. {{ISBN|99936-14-39-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lhasaanditsmyst00waddgoog#page/n476/mode/2up Lhasa and Its Mysteries] by Lawrence Austine Waddell, 1905, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simple suspension bridge]]s, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.

This type of bridge has cables suspended between [[tower]]s, with vertical ''suspender cables'' that transfer the [[Structural load#Live load, imposed loads, transient load|live]] and [[Structural load#Dead load|dead]] loads of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other [[suspension bridge types]], this type often is constructed without [[falsework]].

The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or [[canyon]] edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own [[truss bridge|trusswork]]. In the latter case, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.

==History==
 [[File:Manhattan_Bridge_2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Bridge]], connecting [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] in New York City, opened in 1909 and is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges; its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world.]]
{{For|bridges where the deck follows the suspenders|simple suspension bridge}}
The earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a [[catenary arch|catenary]] shape.

===Precursor===
The [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[siddha]] and bridge-builder [[Thangtong Gyalpo]] originated the use of [[wrought iron|iron]] chains in his version of [[simple suspension bridge]]s. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern [[Bhutan]]. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in [[Duksum]] en route to [[Trashi Yangtse]], which was finally washed away in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;q=Thangtong+Gyalpo+suspension+bridge&amp;pg=PA131|isbn=978-1-74059-529-2|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyalpo's iron chain bridges did not include a [[suspended deck bridge]], which is the standard on  all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The [[stress (mechanics)|stress points]] that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chakzampa Thangtong Gyalpo|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies|page=61|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140525105817/http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/311/pdf/Chakzampa.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have also used tightly bound cloth.

===Chain bridges===
The first iron [[Chain bridge|chain suspension bridge]] in the [[Western world]] was the [[Jacob's Creek Bridge]] (1801) in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], designed by inventor [[James Finley (engineer)|James Finley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Wire of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge|publisher=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430064802/http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html|archive-date=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finley's bridge was the first to incorporate all of the necessary components of a modern suspension bridge, including a suspended deck which hung by trusses. Finley patented his design in 1808, and published it in the Philadelphia journal, [[The Port Folio]], in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bridges: Three Thousand Years of Defying Nature|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARwZhPVA6ZYC&amp;q=suspended+deck+bridge+by+James+Finley&amp;pg=PA56|isbn=978-0-7603-1234-6|date=12 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early British chain bridges included the [[Dryburgh Abbey Bridge]] (1817) and 137 m [[Union Bridge (Tweed)|Union Bridge]] (1820), with spans rapidly increasing to 176 m with the [[Menai Suspension Bridge|Menai Bridge]] (1826), &quot;the first important modern suspension bridge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374642/Menai-Bridge|title=Menai Bridge - bridge, Wales, United Kingdom|website=britannica.com|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413220655/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374642/Menai-Bridge|archive-date=13 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chain bridge on the German speaking territories was the [[Chain Bridge (Nuremberg)|Chain Bridge]] in [[Nuremberg]].
The [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] (designed in 1831, completed in 1864  with a 214 m central span) is one of the longest of the parabolic arc chain type. The current [[Marlow Bridge|Marlow suspension bridge]] was designed by [[William Tierney Clark]] and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828.  It is the only suspension bridge across the non-tidal Thames. The [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]], (designed in 1840, opened in 1849), spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Clark and it is a larger scale version of Marlow bridge.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marlow Suspension Bridge&quot;.

An interesting variation is [[Thornewill and Warham]]'s [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge]] in [[Burton-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]] (1889), where the chains are not attached to abutments as is usual, but instead are attached to the main girders, which are thus in compression.  Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm) wide by an inch and a half (38&amp;nbsp;mm) thick, rivetted together.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746#details {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235610/https://www.ice.org.uk/disciplines-and-resources/ice-library-and-digital-resources/historical-engineering-works/details?hewID=2746 |date=25 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wire-cable===
The first wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spider Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1816), a modest and temporary footbridge built following the collapse of James Finley's nearby [[Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill]] (1808). The footbridge's span was 124 m, although its deck was only 0.45 m wide.

Development of wire-cable suspension bridges dates to the temporary simple suspension bridge at [[Annonay]] built by [[Marc Seguin]] and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot;/&gt; The first permanent wire cable suspension bridge was [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]]'s Saint Antoine Bridge in [[Geneva]] of 1823, with two 40 m spans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first with cables assembled in mid-air in the modern method was [[Joseph Chaley]]'s Grand Pont Suspendu in [[Fribourg]], in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, the first major wire-cable suspension bridge was the [[Spring Garden Street Bridge#2nd bridge: Wire Bridge at Fairmount|Wire Bridge at Fairmount]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by [[Charles Ellet Jr.]] and completed in 1842, it had a span of 109 m. Ellet's Niagara Falls suspension bridge (1847–48) was abandoned before completion. It was used as [[scaffolding]] for [[John A. Roebling]]'s [[Bridge#Double-decker bridge|double decker]] railroad and carriage bridge (1855).

The [[Otto Beit Bridge]] (1938–39) was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm Cleveland Bridge Company (UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720172523/http://www.clevelandbridge.com/Gallery%20Historic.htm |date=20 July 2008 }} Web site Retrieved 21 February 2007, includes image of the bridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Bridge main components===
Two towers/pillars, two suspension cables, four suspension cable anchors, multiple suspender cables, the bridge deck.&lt;ref&gt;diagram&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural analysis=== &lt;!-- Please see the article discussion if you think the terms parabola and catenary should be swapped. --&gt;
The main [[force (physics)|force]]s in a suspension bridge of any type are [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] in the cables and [[compression (physical)|compression]] in the pillars. Since almost all the force on the pillars is vertically downwards, and the bridge is also stabilized by the main cables, the [[column|pillars]] can be made quite slender, as on the [[Severn Bridge]], on the Wales-England border.

{{wide image|Severn bridge-panoramic.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|The slender lines of the [[Severn Bridge]]}}

In a suspended deck bridge, cables suspended via towers hold up the road deck. The weight is transferred by the cables to the towers, which in turn transfer the weight to the ground.

[[File: Comparison catenary parabola.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Comparison of a catenary (black dotted curve) and a parabola (red solid curve) with the same span and sag. 
{{hidden top|title=More details}}
The catenary represents the profile of a simple suspension bridge or the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its deck and hangers have negligible mass compared to its cable. The parabola represents the profile of the cable of a suspended-deck suspension bridge on which its cable and hangers have negligible mass compared to its deck. The profile of the cable of a real suspension bridge with the same span and sag lies between the two curves.
{{hidden bottom}}
]]

Assuming a negligible weight as compared to the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a [[parabola]] (very similar to a [[catenary]], the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, that makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a [[cable-stayed bridge]] in which the deck is in compression.

===Advantages===
[[File: Suspension bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A suspension bridge can be made out of simple materials such as wood and common wire rope.]]

*Longer main spans are achievable than with any other type of bridge.
*Less material may be required than other bridge types, even at spans they can achieve, leading to a reduced construction cost.
*Except for installation of the initial temporary cables, little or no access from below is required during construction and so a waterway can remain open while the bridge is built above.
*They may be better able to withstand earthquake movements than heavier and more rigid bridges.
*Bridge decks can have deck sections replaced in order to widen traffic lanes for larger vehicles or add additions width for separated cycling/pedestrian paths.

===Disadvantages===
*Considerable stiffness or aerodynamic profiling may be required to prevent the bridge deck vibrating under high winds.
*The relatively low deck stiffness compared to other (non-suspension) types of bridges makes it more difficult to carry [[Passenger rail terminology#Heavy rail|heavy rail]] traffic in which high concentrated [[Structural load#Types of loads|live loads]] occur.
*Some access below may be required during construction to lift the initial cables or to lift deck units. That access can often be avoided in [[cable-stayed bridge]] construction.

==Variations==
===Underspanned===
[[File:Micklewood-bridge.png|thumb|Micklewood Bridge as illustrated by Charles Drewry, 1832]]
[[File:Squibb Park Bridge uncut jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Squibb Park Bridge]], [[Brooklyn]], built 2013]]

[[File:Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge.JPG|thumb|The [[Yichang Bridge]], a plate deck suspension bridge, over the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]
In an underspanned suspension bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters&quot;/&gt; James Smith's Micklewood Bridge;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drewry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Memoir of Suspension Bridges: Comprising The History Of Their Origin And Progress |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |last=Drewry |first=Charles Stewart |year=1832 |publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman |location=London |access-date=13 June 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213647/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |archive-date=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposal by [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] for a bridge over the River Almond near [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drewry&quot;/&gt;

[[Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct]] (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables.
The timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.

===Suspension cable types===
The main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from a chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or [[eyebar]] can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] over the [[Ohio River]].) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.

====Suspender cable terminations====
Poured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent cable termination. They are created by inserting the suspender wire rope (at the bridge deck supports) into the narrow end of a conical cavity which is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or 'capel', and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb80Sb15Sn5) solder.&lt;ref&gt;T R Barnard (1959). &quot;Winding Ropes and Guide Ropes:&quot;   Mechanical Engineering. Coal Mining Series (2nd ed.). London: Virtue. pp. 374–375.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deck structure types===
Most suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]] bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow [[box girders]], first seen on the [[Severn bridge]] built 1961–6. In the picture of the [[Yichang Bridge]], note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.

== Forces ==
Three kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the [[Structural load#Dead load|dead]] load, the [[Structural load#Live load, imposed loads, transient load|live]] load, and the [[structural load#Environmental loads|dynamic]] load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.

===Use other than road and rail===
[[File: Cable-suspended footbridge at DFW terminal D.JPG|left|thumb|Cable-suspended footbridge at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth Airport]] Terminal D]]
The principles of suspension used on a large scale also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the [[Nescio Bridge]] in the Netherlands, and the Roebling designed 1904 Riegelsville suspension pedestrian bridge across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;As exists with signage re the history.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct special towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a [[tubular bridge]].

Typical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction on the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) up to as long as a decade (the Akashi-Kaikyō Bridge's construction began in May 1986 and was opened in May 1998 – a total of twelve years).
#Where the towers are founded on underwater piers, [[Caisson (engineering)|'' caissons'']] are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the [[bedrock]] is too deep to be exposed by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an [[active fault]], and this has been implemented on the foundations of the [[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] [[Rio-Antirio bridge]].) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.
#Where the towers are founded on dry land, deep foundation excavation or pilings are used.
#From the tower foundation, towers of single or multiple columns are erected using high-strength reinforced concrete, stonework, or steel. Concrete is used most frequently in modern suspension bridge construction due to the high cost of steel.
#Large devices called ''saddles'', which will carry the main suspension cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, they can also be manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main cables to shift under construction and normal loads.
#'' Anchorages'' are constructed, usually in tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually anchored in good quality rock but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open ''eyebolts'' enclosed within a secure space.
#Temporary suspended walkways, called ''catwalks'', are then erected using a set of guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These catwalks follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a [[catenary]] arc. Typical catwalks are usually between eight and ten feet wide and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.
#Gantries are placed upon the catwalks, which will support the main cable spinning reels. Then,  cables attached to winches are installed, and in turn, the main cable spinning devices are installed.
#High strength wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge galvanized steel wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed over an open anchor [[eyebar]]. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a &quot;cable strand&quot; is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, the shape of the main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross-section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.
#At specific points along the main cable (each being the exact distance horizontally in relation to the next) devices called &quot;cable bands&quot; are installed to carry steel wire ropes called ''Suspender cables.'' Each suspender cable is engineered and cut to precise lengths, and are looped over the cable bands. In some bridges, where the towers are close to or on the shore, the suspender cables may be applied only to the central span. Early suspender cables were fitted with zinc jewels and a set of steel washers, which formed the support for the deck. Modern suspender cables carry a shackle-type fitting.
#Special lifting hoists attached to the suspenders or from the main cables are used to lift prefabricated sections of the bridge deck to the proper level, provided that the local conditions allow the sections to be carried below the bridge by barge or other means.  Otherwise, a traveling [[cantilever]] derrick may be used to extend the deck one section at a time starting from the towers and working outward. If the addition of the deck structure extends from the towers the finished portions of the deck will pitch upward rather sharply, as there is no downward force in the center of the span. Upon completion of the deck, the added load will pull the main cables into an arc mathematically described as a [[parabola]], while the arc of the deck will be as the designer intended – usually a gentle upward arc for added clearance if over a shipping channel, or flat in other cases such as a span over a canyon. Arched suspension spans also give the structure more rigidity and strength.
#With the completion of the primary structure various details such as lighting, handrails, finish painting and paving is installed or completed.

==Notable collapses==
*[[Silver Bridge]], [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]] – Eyebar chain highway bridge, built-in 1928, that collapsed in late 1967, killing forty-six people.
*[[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], (USA), 853&amp;nbsp;m – 1940. The [[Tacoma Narrows]] bridge was vulnerable to structural vibration in sustained and moderately strong winds due to its plate-girder deck structure. Wind caused a phenomenon called aeroelastic fluttering that led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was captured on film. No human lives were lost in the collapse; several drivers escaped their cars on foot and reached the anchorages before the span dropped.

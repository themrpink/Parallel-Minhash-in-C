Phoenixes are present and relatively common in European [[heraldry]], which developed during the [[High Middle Ages]]. They most often appear as [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and more rarely as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]]. The heraldic phoenix is depicted as the head, chest and wings of an eagle rising from a fire; the entire creature is never depicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, 240, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular culture==
{{main|List of phoenixes in popular culture}}
In the modern era, the phoenix motif continues to see use in a variety of contexts. [[Elon University]]'s sports teams became known as the Phoenix in 2000, stemming from the colleges fire and subsequent recovery in 1923. University trustees at the time announced their intentions to make Elon &quot;rise from the ashes&quot;.

[[Swarthmore College]]'s newspaper has been named &quot;The Phoenix&quot; since the college's fire in 1881&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/a-brief-history/1882-phoenix-founded|title=1882 The Phoenix Founded|date=2016-05-13|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the phoenix bird was considered emblematic of the college's rebirth from its ashes.  More recently, &quot;Phineas the Phoenix&quot; has become the official mascot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/phoenix|title=The Phoenix|date=2014-07-08|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Swarthmore College, with a dancing student inside a costume of plush plumage.

The [[Flag of San Francisco|flag]] of [[San Francisco, California]] features a phoenix in its center, symbolic of the city’s rebuilding following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].

The club crest of [[Coventry City Football Club]] features a phoenix rising from the flames, in recognition of how the City of [[Coventry]] was rebuilt after being destroyed by the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Blitz bombing campaigns of World War 2.

[[Coventry University]] use a phoenix rising from the flames as their emblem, tying in with the city they are based, and the same reason [[Coventry City Football Club]] carry a phoenix on their club crest.

==Analogues==
Scholars have observed analogues to the phoenix in a variety of cultures. These analogues include the [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] ''[[garuda]]'' (गरुड) and ''[[gandaberunda|bherunda]]'' (भेरुण्ड), the [[Slavic folklore|Russian]] [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|firebird]], the [[Persian mythology|Persian]] ''[[simorgh]]'' (سیمرغ), the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] ''paskunji'', the [[Arabian mythology|Arabian]] ''[[anqa]]'' (عنقاء), the [[Turkic mythology|Turkish]] [[Konrul]], also called ''Zümrüdü Anka'' (&quot;emerald anqa&quot;), the [[Tibet|Tibetan]] ''Me byi karmo'', the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] ''[[Fenghuang]]'' (鳳凰) and [[Vermilion Bird|zhu que]] (朱雀), and the Japanese [[fenghuang|hō-ō]] (鳳凰).{{Sfn | Garry | El-Shamy | 2005 | pp = 84–87}}
These perceived analogues are sometimes included as part of the [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]] ''phoenix'' motif (B32).&lt;ref name=&quot;B32&quot;/&gt;

'''Phoenix''' is a minor [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]]. Named after the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]  charted the brighter stars and gave their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° [[declination]], and from 23.5h to 2.5h of [[right ascension]]. The constellations Phoenix, [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Tucana]], are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, [[Alpha Phoenicis]], is named Ankaa, an [[Arabic]] word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is [[Beta Phoenicis]], actually a [[Binary star|binary]] system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. [[Nu Phoenicis]] has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered [[galaxy cluster]]s [[El Gordo (galaxy cluster)|El Gordo]] and the [[Phoenix Cluster]]—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the [[visible universe]]. Phoenix is the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of two annual [[meteor shower]]s: the [[Phoenicids]] in December, and the July Phoenicids.

[[File:Johann Bayer - Uraniometria - Southern Birds.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The &quot;southern birds&quot;, as depicted in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]''. Phoenix is on the lower left.]]
Phoenix was the largest of the twelve constellations established by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]]. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name ''Den voghel Fenicx'', &quot;The Bird Phoenix&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's catalogue |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; symbolising the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] of classical mythology.&lt;ref name=ridpathphe&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/phoenix.htm | title=Phoenix – the Phoenix |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One name of the brightest star [[Alpha Phoenicis]]—Ankaa—is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''العنقاء''' ''al-‘anqā’'' &quot;the phoenix&quot;, and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Kunitsch, Paul| author2= Smart, Tim |date= 2006 |title=A Dictionary of Modern Star names: A Short Guide to 254 Star Names and Their Derivations |publisher=Sky Publishing Corp |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=49 |isbn=978-1-931559-44-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and [[La Caille]], Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, ''Al Ri'āl'', or as a griffin or eagle.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, ''Al Zaurak'', on the nearby river Eridanus.&lt;ref name=&quot;motz&quot;/&gt; He observed, &quot;the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention.&quot;&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, [[Ankaa]] ([[Alpha Phoenicis]]), and stars from the adjacent constellation [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] to depict ''Bakui'', a net for catching birds.&lt;ref name=ridpathphe/&gt; Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of [[Grus (constellation)|Grus]] together were seen by [[Julius Schiller]] as portraying [[Aaron]] the High Priest.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; These two constellations, along with nearby [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Tucana]], are called the Southern Birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;binocs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore, Patrick|title=Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|date=2000|pages=48|isbn=978-0521793902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jvbtl2Vyxm4C&amp;q=phoenix+pavo+grus+tucana&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by [[Fornax]] and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of [[Hydrus]] to the south, and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] to the east and southeast. The bright star [[Achernar]] is nearby.&lt;ref name=klepesta&gt;{{cite book|last=Klepešta|first=Josef|author2=Rükl, Antonín|title=Constellations|publisher=Hamlyn|date=1974|origyear=1969|pages=[https://archive.org/details/constellationsco0000klep/page/214 214–15]|isbn=978-0-600-00893-4|url=https://archive.org/details/constellationsco0000klep/page/214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is &quot;Phe&quot;.&lt;ref name=pa30_469&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The new international symbols for the constellations | journal=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] | volume=30 | pages=469–71| bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | date=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|23|26.5}} and {{RA|02|25.0}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°.&lt;ref name=boundary&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Phoenix, constellation boundary | journal=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#phe | accessdate=23 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the [[equator]].

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Phoenix''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Φοῖνιξ ''Phoinix'', [[genitive case|gen]]. Φοίνικος ''Phoinikos'') was the son of king [[Amyntor (son of Ormenus)|Amyntor]], and a king of the [[Dolopia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v. Phoenix (2), pp. 477&amp;ndash;478; Smith [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DP%3Aentry+group%3D27%3Aentry%3Dphoenix-bio-2 s.v. Phoenix 2].&lt;/ref&gt; '''Phoenix''', on the urgings of his mother (variously named as [[Cleobule]], Hippodameia, or Alcimede) had sex with his father's concubine. Amyntor, discovering this, called upon the [[Erinyes]] to curse him with childlessness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.417-9.452 9.434&amp;ndash;495].&lt;/ref&gt; In later accounts of the story, Phoenix was falsely accused by Amyntor's concubine, and blinded by his father, but [[Chiron]] restored his sight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.13.8 3.13.8].&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix fled to [[Peleus]], the king of [[Phthia]], and [[Achilles]]' father, where Peleus made Phoenix a king of the Dolopians, and gave him the young Achilles to raise.

Phoenix participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 173; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:8.260-8.364 8.307].&lt;/ref&gt; and was said to have given Achilles' son the name [[Neoptolemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 581; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:10.26.4 10.26.4] = ''[[Cypria]]'' fr. 19 West, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_epic_fragments_trojan_cycle_cypria/2003/pb_LCL497.99.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=jVxED0 pp. 98&amp;ndash;99].&lt;/ref&gt; As an old man he accompanied [[Achilles]] to the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.162-9.204 9.165&amp;ndash;169], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.205-9.243 9.220&amp;ndash;224], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.417-9.452 9.427&amp;ndash;622], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:16.155-16.199 16.194], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:17.543-17.566 17.555&amp;ndash;561], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:19.309-19.348 19.309&amp;ndash;313], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:23.351-23.387 23.359&amp;ndash;361]; [[Ovid]],  ''[[Heroides]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi002.perseus-eng1:3 3.27&amp;ndash;29], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi002.perseus-eng1:3 3.127&amp;ndash;130]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.13.8 3.13.8].&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, after Achilles died, Phoenix was one of those sent to fetch [[Neoptolemus]] from [[Scyros]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sophocles]], ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng1:343-390 343&amp;ndash;344], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng1:1314-1347 1329&amp;ndash;1342]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.5.10 E.5.10&amp;ndash;11]; [[Philostratus the Younger]], ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/philostratus_younger-imagines_1_achilles_scyros_pyrrhus_scyros/1931/pb_LCL256.293.xml 394 K 6].&lt;/ref&gt; On his way home from Troy, Phoenix died and was buried by [[Neoptolemus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]],  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.6.12 E.6.12].&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb was said to be either in [[Eion]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DP%3Aentry+group%3D27%3Aentry%3Dphoenix-bio-2 s.v.

Phoenix plays an important role in Book 9 of the ''[[Iliad]]'' of  [[Homer]]. [[Achilles]], the Greeks' greatest warrior, has withdrawn from the war because of his great anger at his ill treatment by the Greek commander [[Agamemnon]].  Phoenix, who had been in charge of Achilles upbringing, now an old man, has accompanied Achilles to the Trojan War. Phoenix is sent by Agamemnon to Achilles' tent, as part of an embassy with [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Odysseus]], to persuade [[Achilles]] to return to the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 613; [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.162-9.204 9.165&amp;ndash;169].&lt;/ref&gt; Odysseus speaks first, presenting Agamemnon's offer of reconciliation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.205-9.243 9.225&amp;ndash;306].&lt;/ref&gt; an appeal which Achilles rejects utterly, saying that he will leave with his ships the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.286-9.327 9.307&amp;ndash;429].&lt;/ref&gt; Then Phoenix, &quot;bursting into tears&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.417-9.452 9.432&amp;ndash;433].&lt;/ref&gt; pleads passionately with Achilles to put down his anger and return to the war. In a long speech covering 172 lines,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.417-9.452 9.434&amp;ndash;605]. For a detailed discussion of Phoenix's speech, see Rosner, pp. 314&amp;ndash;327. Several scholars have questioned the authenticity of this section of the ''Iliad'' see Rosner, p. 314; Scodel, p. 129 with n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix's speech presents an &quot;exposition of heroic, traditional ethics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scodel, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix begins by reminding Achilles how he came to be a second father to Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.417-9.452 9.434&amp;ndash;495]. For a detailed discussion of the autobiographical part of Phoenix's speech see Rosner, pp. 315&amp;ndash;318; Scodel, pp. 128&amp;ndash;136. Rosner, p. 315, describes the theme of this section of the speech as one of &quot;paternal love and duty&quot;. Scodel, p. 128 n. 3, notes that the scholarly consensus sees this part of Phoenix's speech &quot;as serving to stress the emotional ties between Phoenix and Achilles&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix's father was Amyntor, the son of Ormenus, and a king in [[Achaea Phthiotis|Hellas]].&lt;ref&gt;For the &quot;hopeless confusion&quot; in Homer's statements concerning the location of Amyntor's kingdom see Leaf's note to ''Iliad'' [https://archive.org/details/cu31924011101643/page/n443  9.447, p. 403].&lt;/ref&gt; When Amyntor forsook his wife, Phoenix's mother, for a concubine, at the urging of his jealous mother, Phoenix had sex with Amyntor's concubine. To punish this crime Amyntor called upon the [[Erinyes]] to curse Phoenix with childlessness. Outraged Phoenix intended to kill Amyntor, but was finally dissuaded. Instead he decided to leave his father's kingdom. For nine days some of his friends and family kept watch over him to prevent his leaving, but finally on the tenth day he managed to escape, and fleeing through Hellas, Phoenix came to [[Phthia]], where king [[Peleus]], the father of Achilles, took in Phoenix, and treated him like a son. Peleus made Phoenix a king of the [[Dolopia]]ns. And Phoenix was given charge of the young Achilles, whom Phoenix reared as a son.&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Having reminded Achilles of all this, Phoenix asks Achilles to &quot;master thy proud spirit; it beseemeth thee not to have a pitiless heart. Nay, even the very gods can bend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.492-9.537 9.495&amp;ndash;501].&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix next relates two stories meant to persuade Achilles. The first story concerns the ''Litai'' (&quot;Prayers&quot;), daughters of [[Zeus]], who follow along after ''Ate'' (&quot;Sin&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rosner, pp. 318&amp;ndash;322; [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.492-9.537 9.502&amp;ndash;514].&lt;/ref&gt;  This story is meant to show Achilles the dangers inherent in refusing prayers of supplication.  After telling the story, Phoenix again asks Achilles to &quot;cast aside thine anger&quot; and heed the supplication of his comrads in arms and return to the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.492-9.537 9.517].&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix reminds Achilles' that heroes of old, in their wrath, might be won over by gifts and pleadings. He then recounts the story of the hero [[Meleager]], with its many parallels to Achilles' situation.&lt;ref&gt;Rosner, pp. 322&amp;ndash;324; Swain, pp. 271&amp;ndash;276.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Achilles, Meleager has withdrawn from battle in anger. Offering gifts, his friends and family beg Meleager to return to the battle, but he refuses them. But when his own household is threatened, finally heeding the pleas of his wife, he returns to the battle, but received no gifts and honors, for doing so. Finally Phoenix urges Achilles not to be like Meleager, but to accept the gifts and honors Agammenon has offered, before it is too late. But Achilles says he has no need of such gifts and has honor enough already. Further he admonishes Phoenix &quot;not to confound my spirit by weeping and sorrowing,&quot; on Agamemnon's behalf. Nevertheless, Achiles invites Phoenix to stay the night &quot;and at break of day we will take counsel whether to return to our own or to tarry here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.581-9.619 9.607&amp;ndash;619].&lt;/ref&gt;

Brief mentions of Phoenix also appear in Books 16, 17, 19, and 23.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 609.&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 16 Phoenix leads a company of [[Myrmidons]] into battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:16.155-16.199 16.194].&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 17, Athena takes Phoenix's form, as she urges on [[Menelaus]] in the heat of battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:17.543-17.566 17.555&amp;ndash;561].&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 19, Phoenix is among those comforting Achilles in his tent after the death of [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]''  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:19.309-19.348 19.309&amp;ndash;313].&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 23, Phoenix is an umpire in Patroclus' funeral games.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:23.351-23.387 23.359&amp;ndash;361].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epic Cycle===
Besides the ''Iliad'' a few other mentions of Phoenix, from the epic tradition, are found in the [[Epic Cycle]], a collection of epic poems about the Trojan War.
According to [[scholia]] to ''Iliad'' 19, citing the Epic Cycle, prior to the Trojan War, Phoenix was sent with Odysseus and [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] to seek out Achilles (who, as it turns out, is hiding on [[Skyros]] disguised as a girl) to recruit him for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 581&amp;ndash;582; Scholia (D) ''Iliad'' 19.326 = ''[[Cypria]]'' fr. 19 West, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_epic_fragments_trojan_cycle_cypria/2003/pb_LCL497.97.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=jVxED0 pp. 96&amp;ndash;99]. Compare with [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 96; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.13.8 3.13.8].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Cypria]]'', (one of the poems in the Epic Cycle) Achilles' son [[Neoptolemus]], originally named Pyrrhus, was given the name Neoptolemus (&quot;young soldier&quot;) by Phoenix, because Achilles was a young man when he went to war.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 581; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:10.26.4 10.26.4] = ''[[Cypria]]'' fr. 19 West, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_epic_fragments_trojan_cycle_cypria/2003/pb_LCL497.99.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=jVxED0 pp. 98&amp;ndash;99].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Proclus' summary of the ''[[Nostoi]]'' Phoenix, while traveling home from the Trojan War with Neoptolemus, died and was buried by Neoptolemus.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 688; Proclus, [http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004:account=5 Summary of the Nostoi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821024138/http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004:account=5 |date=2006-08-21 }} = ''Returns'' argument 4 West [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_epic_fragments_trojan_cycle_returns/2003/pb_LCL497.157.xml pp. 156, 157].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later sources===
The late sixth-century early fifth-century BC poet [[Pindar]] mentioned Phoenix, saying that he &quot;held a throng of Dolopians, bold in the use of the sling and bringing aid to the missiles of the Danaans, tamers of horses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.5.5 9.5.5] = [[Pindar]] fr. 183 Race [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pindar-fragments/1997/pb_LCL485.409.xml?rskey=k1AmON&amp;result=1 pp. 408, 409].&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix appeared as a character in [[tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]]' lost play ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)|Myrmidons]]'' (c. 490&amp;ndash;480), which included an embassy scene, and presumably Phoenix's attempt to persuade Achilles to put aside his anger and return to the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aeschylus-attributed_fragments/2009/pb_LCL505.135.xml p. 134]; Shapiro 1994, p. 19; Aeschylus fr. 132b Sommerstein, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aeschylus-attributed_fragments/2009/pb_LCL505.139.xml pp. 138, 139].&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]], in his play ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]]'' (409 BC), tells us that after Achilles died at Troy, the Greeks received a prophecy which said that they would never take Troy unless Neoptolemus came to fight for them, so the Greeks sent Phoenix and Odysseus to [[Scyros]] to bring Neoptolemus back with them to Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 639&amp;ndash;640; [[Sophocles]], ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng1:343-390 343&amp;ndash;344], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng1:557-590 557&amp;ndash;567], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg006.perseus-eng1:1314-1347 1329&amp;ndash;1342].

Sophocles, and his fellow tragedians [[Euripides]], and [[Ion of Chios]], among others, all wrote plays titled ''Phoenix'', now lost, which presumably told the story of Phoenix's conflict with his father.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 618; Kotlinska-Toma, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3YeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 30], [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3YeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 62]. Sophocles' ''Phoenix'' may be the same as a play elsewhere called ''The Dolopians'', see Llyod-Jones, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/sophocles-fragments_known_plays/1996/pb_LCL483.69.xml pp. 68&amp;ndash;69]. Phoenix also appeared as a character in Sophocles, ''The Lovers of Achilles'', see Llyod-Jones, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/sophocles-fragments_known_plays/1996/pb_LCL483.59.xml p. 58], and probably played an important role in Sophocles' ''Scyrians'', see Kotlinska-Toma, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3YeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187 187]; Lloyd-Jones, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/sophocles-fragments_known_plays/1996/pb_LCL483.277.xml pp. 276&amp;ndash;277].&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about the plays by Sophocles or Ion. However, from an allusion in [[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[The Acharnians]]'', Euripides is known to have represented Phoenix as blind.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 618; [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Acharnians]]''

The [[Cyzicene epigrams]], the third book of the ''[[Palatine Anthology]]'', refers to the blinding of Phoenix by Amyntor, with Phoenix's mother, here named Alcimede, trying to restrain her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 618; ''[[Palatine Anthology]]'' 3.3 (Paton, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_anthology_3/2014/pb_LCL067.153.xml pp. 152&amp;ndash;153])&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Lycophron]] alludes to Phoenix, and his blinding by his father, and connects Phoenix with [[Eion]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/528/mode/2up 417&amp;ndash;423], with notes f and h.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was said to have been buried.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DP%3Aentry+group%3D27%3Aentry%3Dphoenix-bio-2 s.v.

Both the poet [[Ovid]] and the mythographer [[Hyginus]] say that Phoenix was one of the heroes to have  participated in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 173; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:8.260-8.364 8.307].&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Virgil]] in his [[Aeneid]], has Phoenix and Odysseus, during the sack of Troy, in a temple, in [[Priam]]'s palace, standing guard over Troy's treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:2.752-2.794 2.761–763].&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.13.8 3.13.8].&lt;/ref&gt; probably drawing on Euripides' ''Phoenix'',&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 618; Frazer's note 3 to Apollodorus, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.13.8 3.13.8].&lt;/ref&gt; says that Phoenix was falsely accused of seducing Amyntor's concubine Phthia. Amyntor blinded Phoenix, but Peleus brought Phoenix to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] who restored his sight. Peleus then made Phoenix king of the Dolopians. Apollodorus mentioned the embassy of Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax, to Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.4.3 E.4.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sophocles, Apollodorus says Phoenix and Odysseus were sent to bring Neoptolemus to Troy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.5.11 E.5.11].&lt;/ref&gt; and agreeing with Proclus, says that after the war, treveling home with Neoptolemus, Phoenix died and Neoptolemus buried him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.6.12 E.6.12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek comic poet [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]] wrote a play titled ''Phoenix'', so too did the Latin poet [[Ennius]].&lt;ref&gt;Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.407.xml p. 407] For Ennius' ''Phoenix'', see Goldberg and Manuwald, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ennius-tragedies/2018/pb_LCL537.115.xml?result=2&amp;rskey=fNnMR4 pp. 114&amp;ndash;121].&lt;/ref&gt;

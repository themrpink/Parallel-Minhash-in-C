In 2018, [[Northwestern University]] interviewed 5,000 adolescents and parents in the US, UK, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand to explore how they related to ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'', a controversial [[TV show]] produced by Netflix. The research suggested that watching  the show prompted conversations between teens and parents about bullying, suicide and mental health. Most importantly, the show led adolescents to show more empathy for their peers. The study also reported that parents and adolescents were interested in finding more information on suicide prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Multinational survey: How teens, parents respond to Netflix show '13 Reasons Why'|url=https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2018/march/13-reasons-why/|access-date=2020-07-22|website=news.northwestern.edu|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that appropriate portrayals of suicide, showing negative consequences or alternative consequences, might have a preventive effect and empower vulnerable audience in encouraging help-seeking and normalizing mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scalvini|first=Marco|date=2020-06-18|title=13 Reasons Why : can a TV show about suicide be 'dangerous'?

A striking example occurred in Vienna, Austria where the media reporting increased dramatically the number of copycat suicides. Reduction began when a working group of the Austrian Association for Suicide Prevention developed media guidelines and initiated discussions with the media which culminated with an agreement to abstain from reporting on cases of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Etzersdorfer|first1=Elmar|last2=Sonneck|first2=Gernot|date=1998|title=Preventing suicide by influencing mass-media reporting.

[[File:Chess board opening staunton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A wooden chessboard with [[Staunton chess set|Staunton pieces]]]]
A '''chessboard''' is the type of {{boardgloss|gameboard}} used for the game of [[chess]], on which the chess [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] and {{chessgloss|pieces}} are placed. A chessboard is usually square in shape, with an alternating pattern of squares in two colours. Though usually played on a surface, a tangible board is not a requirement to play the game. Traditionally wooden boards are made of unstained light and dark brown woods. To reduce cost, many boards are made with veneers of more expensive woods glued to an inner piece of plywood or chipboard. A variety of colours combinations are used for plastic, vinyl, and silicone boards. Common dark-light combinations are black and white, as well as brown, green or blue with [[buff (colour)|buff]] or [[cream (colour)|cream]]. Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]], and [[cardboard]] are common for less important tournaments and matches and for home use. 
[[Decorative glass]] and marble boards are rarely permitted for games conducted by national or international chess federations. When they are permitted, they must meet various criteria (see the text on FIDE regulations below)

In western chess the board has a [[square]] shape, with its side being divided into eight parts, resulting in a total of sixty-four squares. For [[List of chess variants|variants]], the total number of squares may range from nine to one hundred and twelve. Each individual square of the board can be identified using [[chess notation]], which may be [[Descriptive notation|descriptive]], [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic]], or [[ICCF numeric notation|numeric]]. For two-dimensional boards, each horizontal row of squares is called a ''{{chessgloss|rank}}'', each vertical column of squares is called a ''{{chessgloss|file}}'', and each oblique line of squares of the same colour  is called a ''{{chessgloss|diagonal}}''.

Board games have been known since [[ancient history]], with the oldest records being paintings in [[mastaba]]s of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First]] and [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasties of Egypt]] (3100–2700 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccione|first=Peter A.|date=1980|title=In Search of the Meaning of Senet|url=http://www.piccionep.people.cofc.edu/piccione_senet.pdf|journal=Archaeology|volume=33|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known version of chess appeared around the 6th century in India and was called [[chaturanga]], played on a board of the game [[Ashtapada]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper (1992), p.173&lt;/ref&gt; This board was monochromatic and divided into eight columns by eight rows, with special marks called ''castles'' in the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth squares of the a-, d-, e-, and h-columns, which served a function in Ashtapada, but not in chaturanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IyFHvy-SCIYC&amp;q=ashtapada&amp;pg=PA46|title=Sports and Games of Medieval Cultures|last=Wilkins|first=Sally E. D.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780313317118|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in [[History of chess#Iran (Persia)|Ancient Persia]], the board was adapted to the new variants of chess, in which more columns and rows were included. One of the variants of the time, [[Tamerlane chess]], had eleven columns by ten rows and two extra squares to the right side of the second row of the player, called ''citadels'', which held a special function in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.chess.free.fr/tamerlane.htm|title=Tamerlane Chess|last=Cazaux|first=Jean-Louis|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, chess arrived in Europe and the board acquired its characteristic recognisable chequered pattern&lt;ref&gt;Yalom 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; used at the time in [[draughts]], which had a smaller 5×5 board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.checkershistory.com/|title=The Checkered History of Checkers|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change proved particularly useful for diagonal movements, now highlighted by the continuous sequence of same-coloured squares in the diagonals, facilitating the movement of the recently added [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[Queen (chess)|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Libro de los juegos]] (1283) contains a description of the chessboard, mentioning eight rows and columns as the ideal number, with the 10×10 board being too tiresome and the 6×6 board being too quick for the practice of chess.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom 2004, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Other innovations of the time were [[Cylinder|cylindrical]] boards for the practice of variants such as [[cylinder chess]]&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and the convention that the first square of the far right column should be light-coloured, endorsed by [[Pedro Damiano]] in the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, some varieties have employed [[Three-dimensional chess|three-dimensional]] boards, in which the third dimension is usually another two-dimensional board. The Raumschach variant utilises five boards of twenty-five squares each, totalising 125 squares.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/3d5.html|title=Raumschach|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another noteworthy variant, ''Star Trek'' Chess, utilises a board of sixty-four squares divided into seven levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/3d.dir/startrek.html|title=3D Chess from Star Trek|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[List of World Chess Championships|ex-world champion]] [[Garry Kasparov]] faced the [[chess engine]] [[X3D Fritz]] in a series of four matches in a [[Virtual reality|virtual environment]], where the computer-generated board hovered in the air in front of Kasparov, who used special glasses. As such, this was the first man–machine game of chess performed in a completely simulated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1269891|title=Kasparov versus X3D Fritz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Chessboards have been made from numerous materials over the years, such as [[ebony]], [[ivory]], [[marble]], [[metal]], [[glass]], and [[plastic]]. They can also be found as decorative elements in plazas, gardens, and living rooms.

For international or continental championships, [[FIDE]]'s regulations state that wooden boards should be used. For other FIDE tournaments, [[wood]], [[plastic]], or cardboard boards may be used, and the board should be rigid in all instances. The board may also be made of [[marble]], as long as there is an appropriate contrast between the light and dark squares. The finishing should be neutral or frosted but never shiny. The squares should be from 5 to 6.5 [[Centimetre|cm]] in length and the proportion between the squares and the pieces should be so that the side of a square is twice the diameter of a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]'s base. If the [[Chess table|table]] and the board are two separate pieces, the latter must be fixed as to avoid its movement during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FIDE Handbook C.

The standard contemporary way to record moves and refer to the squares of the chessboard is [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic chess notation]]  The files are identified by the letters ''a'' to ''h'', from left to right from the white player's point of view, and the ranks by the numbers ''1'' to ''8'', with 1 being closest to the white player. Each square on the board is identified by a unique coordinate pairing, from a1 to h8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Just |first1=Tim |last2=Burg |first2=Daniel B. |title=United States Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess |date=2003|publisher=Random House Puzzles &amp; Games |isbn=0-8129-3559-4 |page=227 |edition=Fifth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTgfWTsAF6IC&amp;q=The+guideline+for+determining+the+proper+square+size+for+a+Staunton+chess+set+is+that+the+king+should+occupy+around+78+percent+of+the&amp;pg=PA227 |access-date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the older [[Descriptive notation|descriptive chess notation]], the files are labelled by the piece originally occupying its first rank (e.g. queen, {{chessgloss|king's rook}}, {{chessgloss|queen's bishop}}), and ranks by the numbers ''1'' to ''8'' from each player's point of view, depending on the move being described. This method is no longer commonly used. FIDE stopped using descriptive notation in 1981.

[[ICCF numeric notation|Numeric notation]] assigns numbers to both files and ranks, with rank 1 being the one closest to the player with the white pieces. The file leftmost to the white player (''a'' in algebraic notation and ''QR'' in descriptive notation) is file one and the rightmost to them (''h'' in algebraic notation and ''KR'' in descriptive notation) is file eight.

== Boards and variants of chess ==
{{See also|Chess variant}}
The usage of chessboards with various shapes goes back to the [[Persian people|Persian]] origins of the game in the 10th century, when the book ''Muraj adh-dhahab'' (Board of the Gods) described six different variants of chess, including [[Circular chess|circular]] and [[Cylinder chess|cylindrical chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/oldtexts.htm|title=Earliest books of chess|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121202800/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/oldtexts.htm|archive-date=January 21, 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another exotic format is used in [[hexagonal chess]], which utilises a hexagonal board with three different colours for its 91 squares.

Boards of different sizes have also been used since the 10th century, with one of the first records being [[Tamerlane chess]], with eleven columns by ten rows. The game originated in Persia and its board contains a peculiar element in the form of the addition of a square to the right of the second row of each player, called a citadel, and which served the purpose of being a refuge for the [[King (chess)|king]] and in some cases reaching a [[Draw (chess)|draw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Due to the widespread creation of new variants, a wide variety of sizes can be found. In 1617, [[Pietro Carrera]] proposed a variant that received his name, Carrera's Chess, with a 10×8 board, later used in other variants such as [[Capablanca Chess]] and Gothic Chess. Other sizes, with ten rows and ten columns, are used in [[Omega Chess]] and [[Grand Chess]]. [[Los Alamos chess]], on the other hand, uses a smaller board with 36 squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/historic.dir/carrera.html|title=Carrera's Chess|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shogi]] and [[janggi]], the Japanese and Korean variants of chess respectively, also have different sizes. The former employs a board with nine columns by nine rows, while the latter uses one with eight columns by nine rows.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; In both janggi and [[xiangqi]] the pieces move through the edges of the squares and the board has other components. In these boards, the d1-, e1-, d2-, and e2-squares, for the whites, and the d7-, e7-, d8-, and e8-squares, for the blacks, are called a Palace or a Fortress and have the function of restricting the movement of the king to this area. Additionally, in xiangqi there is a space between the fourth and fifth rows, called a Celestial River, which restricts the movement of some pieces such as the [[Elephant (chess)|elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/origins-of-chess|title=Origins of chess|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many varieties of chess also use more than a single chessboard per match, for different reasons. [[Bughouse chess]], for example, is played by four players disputing two simultaneous matches in separate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/multiplayer.dir/tandem.html|title=Bughouse Chess|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Chess]] is a popular variant which, although can be played in a single chessboard, is usually played in two to facilitate the movement of pieces between the boards.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants such as [[Three-dimensional chess#Raumschach|Raumschach]] utilise extra boards to simulate the third dimension. While Raumschach uses five boards, extending the game's third dimension through five squares, other variants may use from one to seven extra boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; ''Star Trek'' Chess uses an ingenious board with movable parts divided into seven levels. In the initial position each player occupies two of the small movable boards with four squares used for attacking. The whites start in the lower level, using attack boards connected to this level and the first two rows of the board, while the blacks start at the top, using the attack boards and first two rows of the third level.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The game of chess has been [[Chess in the arts|represented in the arts]] since its origin in Asia. Chessboards usually had considerable artistic value, being made of noble materials such as ebony and ivory, and in large sizes. Many of these pieces were offered to churches as relics. The book [[Liber miraculorum sancte Fidis]] tells a story in which a nobleman, after miraculously escaping from prison, is forced to carry a chessboard until a sanctuary as gesture of gratitude. However, more frequently there are stories in which the chessboard is used as a weapon. The French tale of [[Ogier the Dane]] reports how the son of [[Charlemagne]] brutally kills one of Ogier's sons with a chessboard after losing a match, although there are no evidences confirming the veracity of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom 2004, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1250 a sermon called ''Quaedam moralitas de scaccario per Innocentium papum'' (The Innocent Morality) showed the world as being represented by a chessboard, with the white and black squares representing the two conditions of life and death or praise and censure over which the [[Chess piece|pieces]], representing humanity, would confront each other in the adversities of the game, symbolising life.

Due to its simple geometry, the chessboard grid is often used in mathematical puzzles or problems unrelated to chess. Examples include the [[wheat and chessboard problem]], the [[mutilated chessboard problem]], and the [[angel problem]].

The '''stratosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|æ|t|ə|ˌ|s|f|ɪər|,_|-|t|oʊ|-}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Stratosphere}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the second major layer of [[Earth's atmosphere]], just above the [[troposphere]], and below the [[mesosphere]]. The stratosphere is [[Atmospheric stratification|stratified]] (layered) in temperature, with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the Earth; this increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation (shortened UV) by the [[ozone layer]].&lt;ref name=ucarOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=The Stratosphere - overview |url=https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/stratosphere-overview |website=scied.ucar.edu |publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research |accessdate=25 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to the troposphere, near the Earth's surface, where temperature decreases with altitude. The border between the troposphere and stratosphere, the [[tropopause]], marks where this temperature inversion begins. Near the equator, the lower edge of the stratosphere is as high as {{convert|20|km|sigfig=2|ft mi|abbr=on}}, at midlatitudes around {{convert|10|km|sigfig=2|ft mi|abbr=on}}, and at the [[geographical pole|poles]] about {{convert|7|km|sigfig=2|ft mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=ucarOverview/&gt; Temperatures range from an average of {{convert|-51|C|sigfig=2|F K|abbr=on}} near the tropopause to an average of {{convert|-15|C|sigfig=2|F K|abbr=on}} near the mesosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwsJetStream&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=NWS JetStream - Layers of the Atmosphere |url=https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/layers |website=www.weather.gov |language=EN-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stratospheric temperatures also vary within the stratosphere as the seasons change, reaching particularly low temperatures in the [[polar night]] (winter).&lt;ref name=&quot;nasaOzoneWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nasa Ozone Watch: Polar vortex facts |url=https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/vortex_NH.html |website=ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winds in the stratosphere can far exceed those in the troposphere, reaching near {{convert|60|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}} in the Southern [[polar vortex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nasaOzoneWatch&quot;/&gt;

== Ozone and temperature ==

The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CHAPTER 10. STRATOSPHERIC OZONE|url=http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap10.html|access-date=2020-10-20|website=acmg.seas.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240&amp;nbsp;nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) photolysis produces O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude ''(see [[temperature inversion]])''; the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 [[Kelvin|K]] (−3[[°C]] or 26.6[[°F]]).&lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld, J. H., and S. N.(2006), Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change 2nd ed, Wiley, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

This vertical [[Atmospheric stratification|stratification]], with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular [[convection]] and associated [[turbulence]] in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic [[eruption column]]s and [[overshooting top]]s in severe [[Supercell|supercell thunderstorms]], may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the [[stratopause]], above which the temperature decreases with height.

Sydney Chapman gave a correct description of the source of stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of [[hydroxyl radical]]s (•OH) with ozone. •OH is formed by the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical produced by the reaction of OH with O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly affect ozone levels via [[radiolysis]] with the subsequent formation of OH. [[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, [[chlorofluorocarbon]] molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole.

Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/summary/|access-date=2020-07-21|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft flight ==

Commercial [[airliner]]s typically cruise at altitudes of {{convert|9|–|12|km|ft|abbr=on}} which is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere in temperate latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/DanielCheng.shtml |title=Altitude of a Commercial Jet |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2011-11-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031180259/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/DanielCheng.shtml |archivedate=2011-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This optimizes [[fuel efficiency]], mostly due to the low temperatures encountered near the tropopause and low air density, reducing [[parasitic drag]] on the [[airframe]]. Stated another way, it allows the airliner to fly faster while maintaining lift equal to the weight of the plane. (The fuel consumption depends on the drag, which is related to the lift by the [[lift-to-drag ratio]].) It also allows the airplane to stay above the [[turbulence|turbulent]] weather of the troposphere.

The [[Concorde]] aircraft cruised at mach 2 at about {{convert|19000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the [[SR-71]] cruised at mach 3 at {{convert|26000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, all within the stratosphere.

Because the temperature in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude, very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there. Most turbulence at this altitude is caused by variations in the [[jet stream]] and other local wind shears, although areas of significant convective activity ([[thunderstorm]]s) in the troposphere below may produce turbulence as a result of  [[convective overshoot]].

On October 24, 2014, [[Alan Eustace]] became the record holder for reaching the altitude record for a manned balloon at {{convert|135,890|ft|sigfig=5|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|date=2014-10-24|title=Parachutist’s Record Fall: Over 25 Miles in 15 Minutes (Published 2014)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/science/alan-eustace-jumps-from-stratosphere-breaking-felix-baumgartners-world-record.html|access-date=2020-10-20|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eustace also broke the world records for vertical speed skydiving, reached with a peak velocity of 1,321&amp;nbsp;km/h (822&amp;nbsp;mph) and total freefall distance of {{convert|123,414|ft|sigfig=5|abbr=on}} – lasting four minutes and 27 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29766189|title=Google's Alan Eustace beats Baumgartner's skydiving record|newspaper=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025121736/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29766189|archivedate=2014-10-25|date=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circulation and mixing ==
The stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative, [[dynamical]], and chemical processes, in which the horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing. The overall circulation of the stratosphere is termed as [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]], which is a single celled circulation, spanning from the tropics up to the poles, consisting of the tropical upwelling of air from the tropical troposphere and the extra-tropical downwelling of air. Stratospheric circulation is a predominantly wave-driven circulation in that the tropical upwelling is induced by the wave force by the westward propagating [[Rossby waves]], in a phenomenon called Rossby-wave pumping.

An interesting feature of stratospheric circulation is the [[quasi-biennial oscillation]] (QBO) in the tropical latitudes, which is driven by [[gravity wave]]s that are convectively generated in the [[troposphere]]. The QBO induces a [[secondary circulation]] that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers, such as [[ozone]]&lt;ref&gt;N.Butchart, A.A. Scaife, J. Austin, S.H.E. Hare, J.R. Knight. ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003004/abstract Quasi-biennial oscillation in ozone in a coupled chemistry-climate model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518230712/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003004/abstract |date=2014-05-18 }}'', Journal of Geophysical Research.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[water vapor]].

Another large-scale feature that significantly influences stratospheric circulation is the breaking planetary waves&lt;ref&gt;M.E. McIntyre, T.N. Palmer. ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v305/n5935/abs/305593a0.html Breaking planetary waves in the stratosphere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055813/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v305/n5935/abs/305593a0.html |date=2017-03-17 }}'', Nature.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in intense quasi-horizontal mixing in the midlatitudes. This breaking is much more pronounced in the winter hemisphere where this region is called the surf zone. This breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high [[potential vorticity]] region known as the [[polar vortex]]. The resultant breaking causes large scale mixing of air and other trace gases throughout the midlatitude surf zone. The timescale of this rapid mixing is much smaller than the much slower timescales of upwelling in the tropics and downwelling in the extratropics.

During northern hemispheric winters, [[sudden stratospheric warmings]], caused by the absorption of [[Rossby wave]]s in the stratosphere, can be observed in approximately half of winters when easterly winds develop in the stratosphere. These events often precede unusual winter weather &lt;ref&gt;M.P. Baldwin and T.J. Dunkerton. '[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/581.short Stratospheric Harbingers of Anomalous Weather Regimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112084150/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/581.short |date=2014-01-12 }}'', Science Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; and may even be responsible for the cold European winters of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A.A.

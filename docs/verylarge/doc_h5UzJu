Most people first encounter chalk in school where it refers to [[Blackboard|blackboard chalk]], which was originally made of mineral chalk, since it readily crumbles and leaves particles that stick loosely to rough surfaces, allowing it to make writing that can be readily erased.   Blackboard chalk manufacturers now may use mineral chalk, other [[limestone|mineral sources]] of calcium carbonate, or the mineral [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]).  While gypsum-based blackboard chalk is the lowest cost to produce, and thus widely used in the [[developing world]], use of carbonate-based chalk produces larger particles and thus less dust, and it is marketed as &quot;dustless chalk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thakker, M., Shukla, P. and Shah, D.O., 2015.

Chalk is a source of [[quicklime]] by [[thermal decomposition]], or [[slaked lime]] following [[quenching]] of quicklime with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Bertram|title=Chemistry for Engineers and Manufacturers: Chemistry of manufacturing processes|year=1990|publisher=University of Wisconsin – Madison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-vmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=chalk+manufacturing&amp;pg=PA127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In southeast England, [[denehole]]s are a notable example of ancient chalk pits. Such [[bell pit]]s may also mark the sites of ancient flint mines, where the prime object was to remove [[flint]] [[nodule (geology)|nodules]] for [[stone tool]] manufacture. The surface remains at [[Cissbury]] are one such example, but perhaps the most famous is the extensive complex at [[Grimes Graves]] in [[Norfolk]].

[[Woodworking joints]] may be fitted by chalking one of the mating surfaces. A trial fit will leave a chalk mark on the high spots of the corresponding surface. Chalk transferring to cover the complete surface indicates a good fit. Builder's [[putty]] also mainly contains chalk as a filler in [[linseed oil]].

Chalk may be used for its properties as a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. In [[agriculture]], chalk is used for raising [[pH]] in soils with high [[acidity]]. The most common forms are CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcium carbonate) and CaO ([[calcium oxide]]). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an [[antacid]]. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild [[abrasive]]. Polishing chalk is chalk prepared with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine polishing of metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chestofbooks.com/home-improvement/workshop/Workshop-Companion/Polishing-Powders.html Information on polishing powders] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111104135738/http://chestofbooks.com/home-improvement/workshop/Workshop-Companion/Polishing-Powders.html |date=2011-11-04 }}, from the 1879 book &quot;The Workshop Companion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Chalk can also be used as [[fingerprint powder]].

=== Previous uses ===

Several traditional uses of chalk have been replaced by other substances, although the word &quot;chalk&quot; is often still applied to the usual replacements. Tailor's chalk is traditionally a hard chalk used to make temporary markings on cloth, mainly by [[tailor]]s. It is now usually made of [[talc]] (magnesium silicate).

Chalk was traditionally used in recreation. In field sports, such as tennis played on grass, powdered chalk was used to mark the boundary lines of the playing field or court. If a ball hits the line, a cloud of chalk or pigment dust will be visible. In recent years, powdered chalk has been replaced with [[titanium dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/020/TeacherResource%20Weightlifting.pdf?v=1356513839795 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192539/http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/020/TeacherResource%20Weightlifting.pdf?v=1356513839795 |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In gymnastics, rock-climbing, weightlifting and [[tug of war]], chalk — now usually [[magnesium carbonate]] — is applied to the hands and feet to remove perspiration and reduce slipping.

Chalk may also be used as a house construction material instead of [[brick]] or [[wattle and daub]]: quarried chalk was cut into blocks and used as [[ashlar]], or loose chalk was rammed into blocks and laid in mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|title=Rammed earth: design and construction guidelines|date=2005|publisher=[[Building Research Establishment]]|location=Bracknell, England|isbn=9781860817342|page=5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitaker|first1=William|title=Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain|date=1872|publisher=Longmans, Green|location=London|isbn=|oclc= 2531996|page=389|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still houses standing which have been constructed using chalk as the main building material. Most are pre-[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] though a few are more recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Easton|first1=David|title=The Rammed Earth House|date=1996|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=9780930031794|page=[https://archive.org/details/rammedearthhouse0000east/page/15 15]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rammedearthhouse0000east/page/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharon Marie Tate Polanski''' (January 24, 1943 – August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers.
 
Tate made her film debut in 1961 as an extra in ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' with [[Anthony Quinn]]. She was next seen in 1966 with the occult-themed ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''. Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film, [[Valley of the Dolls (film)|''Valley of the Dolls'']], earning her a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination. That year she also performed in the film ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' directed by her future husband [[Roman Polanski]]. Tate's last completed film, ''[[The Thirteen Chairs|12+1]]'', was released posthumously in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sandford | first=C. | title=Polanski: A Biography | publisher=St. Martin's Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-230-61176-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41rgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 | language=sv | access-date=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goble | first=A. | title=The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film | publisher=De Gruyter | year=1999 | isbn=978-3-11-095194-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyqc0Qa6b60C&amp;pg=PA366 | access-date=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were [[Tate murders|murdered]] by members of the [[Manson Family]] in the home she shared with her husband. At the time of her death, she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;BugliosiGentry1974&quot; /&gt;

== Life and career ==

===1943–1964: Childhood and early acting career===
Sharon Marie Tate was born on January 24, 1943, in Dallas, Texas, the eldest of three daughters to Colonel Paul James Tate (1922–2005),&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/24/local/me-passings24.2 Paul Tate, 82; Investigated Murder of Daughter Sharon Tate]. ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 24, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States Army]] officer, and his wife, Doris Gwendolyn (née Willett, 1924–1992). Her sister Debra stated that the family are of [[English people|English]] and [[Swiss people|French-Swiss]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.twitter.com/debra_tate9/status/531885582255788032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsharon-tate-fans.proboards.com%2Fthread%2F140%2Ftate-familys-ethnic-background Debra Tate]. [[Twitter]]. Retrieved August 21, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; At six months of age, Tate won the &quot;Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas Pageant&quot;, but her parents had no show business ambitions for their daughter. Paul Tate was promoted and transferred several times. By the age of 16, Tate had lived in six cities and reportedly found it difficult to maintain friendships. Her family described her as shy and lacking in self-confidence. As an adult, Tate commented that people would misinterpret her shyness as aloofness until they knew her better.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate attended Chief Joseph Junior High School (now Chief Joseph Middle School) from September 1955 to June 1958, and Columbia High School (now Richland High School) in [[Richland, Washington]], from September 1958 to October 1959.  She attended Irvin High School in [[El Paso, Texas]], from late fall 1959 to April 1960; and Vicenza American High School in [[Vicenza|Vicenza, Italy]], from April 1960 to June 1961. Tate graduated from Vicenza American High School in 1961.

As she matured, people commented on Tate's beauty; she began entering beauty pageants, winning the title of &quot;Miss Richland&quot; in Washington in 1959. She spoke of her ambition to study psychiatry, and also stated her intention to compete in the &quot;[[Miss Washington]]&quot; pageant in 1960; however, before she could do either, her father received orders to be stationed in Italy. With her family relocating in [[Verona]], Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in a swimsuit on the cover of the military newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''. She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and for the first time in her life began to form lasting friendships.

[[File:Max Baer Jr, Nancy Kulp and Sharon Tate in The Beverly Hillbillies, The Giant Jackrabbit episode.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white screenshot from the television series, ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' shows Max Baer, Jr. as Jethro, Nancy Kulp as Jane Hathaway, and Sharon Tate as Janet Trego, a secretary. Tate is wearing a business suit and a dark wig, and is watching Miss Hathaway|Sharon Tate (at right wearing a dark wig) as Janet Trego in the 1964 &quot;Giant Jackrabbit&quot; episode of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' with [[Max Baer, Jr.]] and [[Nancy Kulp]].]]

Tate and her friends became interested in the filming of ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]'', which was being made nearby with [[Paul Newman]], [[Susan Strasberg]], and [[Richard Beymer]], and obtained parts as [[Extra (acting)|film extras]]. Beymer noticed Tate in the crowd and introduced himself, and the two dated during the production of the film, with Beymer encouraging Tate to pursue a film career. In 1960 Tate was employed by the singer [[Pat Boone]] and appeared with him in an episode of the television series ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' that was filmed in [[Venice]].

Later that year, when ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' was being filmed near Verona, Tate was once again hired as an extra. Actor [[Jack Palance]] was impressed by her appearance and her attitude, although her role was too small to judge her talent. He arranged a [[screen test]] for her in [[Rome]], but this did not lead to further work. Tate returned to the United States alone, saying she wanted to further her studies, but tried to find film work. After a few months, Doris Tate, who feared for her daughter's safety, suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and her daughter was persuaded to return to Italy. {{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

The family returned to the United States in 1962 and Tate moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she contacted [[Richard Beymer]]'s agent, Harold Gefsky. After their first meeting, Gefsky agreed to represent her, and secured work for her in television and magazine advertisements. In 1963, he introduced her to [[Martin Ransohoff]], director of [[Filmways|Filmways, Inc.]], who signed her to a seven-year contract. She was considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on [[CBS]]'s sitcom ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', but Ransohoff believed that she lacked confidence and the role was given to [[Jeannine Riley]]. Ransohoff gave Tate small parts in ''[[Mister Ed]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' to help her gain experience, but was unwilling to allow her to play a more substantial role. &quot;Mr. Ransohoff didn't want the audience to see me till I was ready,&quot; Tate was quoted in a 1967 article in ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt;

During this time, Tate met the French actor [[Philippe Forquet]] and began a relationship with him in 1963. They became engaged, but their relationship was volatile and they frequently quarreled. Career pressures drove them apart and they broke up the next year in 1964.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

In 1964 she met [[Jay Sebring]], a former sailor who had established himself as a leading hair stylist in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. Tate later said that Sebring's nature was especially gentle, but when he proposed marriage, she declined. She said she would retire from acting as soon as she married, and at that time she intended to focus on her career.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

===1964–1967: Film career===
In 1964 Tate made a screen test for [[Sam Peckinpah]] opposite [[Steve McQueen]] for the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]''. Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate's timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of [[Tuesday Weld]].{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances, and after she [[audition]]ed unsuccessfully for the role of Liesl in the film version of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' and ''[[The Sandpiper]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BugliosiGentry1974&quot; /&gt; In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion picture in the film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', costarring [[David Niven]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Donald Pleasence]], and [[David Hemmings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanders2002&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Sharon Tate in Eye of the Devil trailer 1.jpg|thumb|Tate in the 1966 film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''.]]
Tate and Sebring traveled to London to prepare for filming, where she met the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n High Priest and High Priestess [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex]] and [[Maxine Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Maxine (2008). ''Fire Child: The Life and Magic of Maxine Sanders, Witch Queen''. Oxford: Mandrake Press. Page 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as part of Ransohoff's promotion of Tate, he arranged the production of a short [[Documentary film|documentary]] called ''All Eyes on Sharon Tate'', to be released at the same time as ''Eye of the Devil''. It included an interview with ''Eye of the Devil'' director [[J. Lee Thompson]], who expressed his initial doubts about Tate's potential with the comment, &quot;We even agreed that if after the first two weeks Sharon was not quite making it, we would put her back in cold storage,&quot; but added he soon realized Tate was &quot;tremendously exciting&quot;.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate played Odile, a witch who exerts a mysterious power over a landowner, played by Niven, and his wife, played by Kerr. Although she did not have as many lines as the other actors, Tate's performance was considered crucial to the film, and she was required, more than the other cast members, to set an ethereal tone. Niven described her as a &quot;great discovery&quot;, and Kerr said that with &quot;a reasonable amount of luck&quot; Tate would be a great success.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} In interviews, Tate commented on her good fortune in working with such professionals in her first film and said that she had learned a lot about acting simply by watching Kerr at work. Much of the filming took place in France, and Sebring returned to Los Angeles to fulfill his business obligations. After filming, Tate remained in London, where she immersed herself in the fashion world and nightclubs. Around this time, she met Roman Polanski.

Tate and Polanski later agreed that neither of them had been impressed by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress [[Jill St. John]] for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate, and after meeting with her, he agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming. The company traveled to Italy for filming where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in communicating with the local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate, and said in an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her. As filming progressed, Polanski praised her performances and her confidence grew. They began a relationship, and Tate moved into Polanski's London apartment after filming ended. Jay Sebring traveled to London, where he insisted on meeting Polanski. Although friends later said he was devastated, he befriended Polanski and remained Tate's closest confidant. Polanski later commented that Sebring was a lonely and isolated person, who viewed Tate and himself as his family.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

Tate returned to the United States to film ''[[Don't Make Waves]]'' with [[Tony Curtis]], leaving Polanski in London. Tate played the role of Malibu and the film was intended to capitalize on the popularity of beach movies and the music of such artists as [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Jan and Dean]]. Tate's character, billed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] publicity as &quot;Malibu, Queen of the Surf&quot;, wore little more than a bikini for most of the film. Disappointed with the film, she began referring to herself sarcastically as &quot;sexy little me&quot;. Before the film's release, a major publishing campaign for [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone sunscreen]] featured Tate. The film opened to poor reviews and mediocre ticket sales, and Tate was quoted as confiding to a reporter, &quot;It's a terrible movie&quot;, before adding, &quot;Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. I guess I'm too outspoken.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Polanski returned to the United States, and was contracted by the head of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Robert Evans]], to direct and write the screenplay for ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', which was based on [[Ira Levin]]'s novel of the [[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|same name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanders2002&quot; /&gt; Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and [[Mia Farrow]] was cast. A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film. A March 1967 article about Tate in ''[[Playboy]]'' began, &quot;This is the year that Sharon Tate happens&amp;nbsp;...&quot; and included six nude or partially nude photographs taken by Roman Polanski during filming of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers''.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate was optimistic: ''Eye of the Devil'' and ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' were each due for release.

She had been signed to play a major role in the film version of ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]''. One of the all-time bestsellers, the film version was highly publicized and anticipated, and while Tate acknowledged that such a prominent role should further her career, she confided to Polanski that she did not 
like either the book or the script.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}. [[Patty Duke]], [[Barbara Parkins]], and [[Judy Garland]] were cast as the other leads. [[Susan Hayward]] replaced Garland a few weeks later when she was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio to auction star contracts |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6197589.stm |access-date=April 7, 2007 | date=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] was highly critical of the three principal actresses, but according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said Robson &quot;continually treated [Tate] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment&quot;.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, &quot;That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She's got a great future.&quot;{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

In interviews during production, Tate expressed an affinity for her character, Jennifer North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body. Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as &quot;a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet&quot;.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate, Duke, and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film. During the shooting of ''Valley of the Dolls'', Tate confided to Parkins that she was &quot;madly in love&quot; with Polanski.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt; &quot;Yes, there's no doubt that Roman is the man in my life,&quot; Tate was quoted as saying in the New York ''Sunday News''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt; Tate promoted the film enthusiastically. She frequently commented on her admiration for [[Lee Grant]], with whom she had played several dramatic scenes. Tate was quoted as saying, &quot;I learned a great deal about acting in [''Valley of the Dolls''], particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant.... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

A journalist asked Tate to comment on her nude scene, and she replied,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no qualms about it at all. I don't see any difference between being stark naked or fully dressed&amp;nbsp;— if it's part of the job and it's done with meaning and intention. I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly. On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can't watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn't make any sense, does it?{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An edited version of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' was released, and Polanski expressed disgust at Ransohoff for &quot;butchering&quot; his film. ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it &quot;a witless travesty&quot;, and it was not profitable. Tate's performance was largely ignored in reviews, and when she was mentioned, it was usually in relation to her nude scenes. ''Eye of the Devil'' was released shortly after, and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] attempted to build interest in Tate with its press release describing her as &quot;one of the screen's most exciting new personalities&quot;. The film failed to find an audience, and most reviews were indifferent, neither praising nor condemning it. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that one of the few highlights was Tate's &quot;chillingly beautiful but expressionless performance&quot;.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

The ''All Eyes on Sharon Tate'' documentary was used to publicize the film. Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming ''Eye of the Devil'', dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and also contained a brief interview with her. Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, &quot;I don't fool myself. I can't see myself doing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&quot; She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy, and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become &quot;a light comedienne in the [[Carole Lombard]] style&quot;.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by: [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]]. Of the latter, she said, &quot;I'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve. She plays beautiful, sensitive, deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;photoscreen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/cean2/photoscreen.htm |first=Johnny |last=Columbus |title=Sharon Tate – Venus on a Treadmill |work=Photo Screen |date=June 1968 |access-date=October 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023211133/http://geocities.com/cean2/photoscreen.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, ''Valley of the Dolls'' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews. [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', &quot;all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=Valley of the Dolls |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=VALLEY%20OF%20THE%20DOLLS%20%28MOVIE%29%20&amp;reviewer=By%20BOSLEY%20CROWTHER%20&amp;pdate=19671216 |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 1967 |access-date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Newsweek'' said that the film &quot;has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure&quot;, but a later article read: &quot;Astoundingly photogenic, infinitely curvaceous, Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The New American Beauties |url=http://www.geocities.com/cean2/covers1a.htm |work=Newsweek |date=March 4, 1968 |access-date=October 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024085030/http://geocities.com/cean2/covers1a.htm|archive-date=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications, including ''The Saturday Review'', which wrote, &quot;Ten years ago&amp;nbsp;... Parkins, Duke, and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens; they are totally lacking in style, authority, or charm.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' provided some positive comments, such as, &quot;Sharon Tate emerges as the film's most sympathetic character&amp;nbsp;...

=== 1968–1969: Marriage and final films ===
In late 1967, Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles. She was depicted as being untraditional and modern, and was quoted as saying that couples should live together before marrying. They were married in [[Chelsea, London]] on January 20, 1968 with considerable publicity. Polanski was dressed in &quot;[[1900s in Western fashion|Edwardian finery]]&quot;, while Tate was attired in a white minidress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanders2002&quot; /&gt; The couple moved into Polanski's [[mews]] house off Eaton Square in Belgravia, London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt; 

Photographer Peter Evans described them as &quot;the imperfect couple. They were the [[Douglas Fairbanks]]/[[Mary Pickford]] of our time…. Cool, nomadic, talented, and nicely shocking. &quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage, but Polanski remained promiscuous and described her attitude to his infidelity as &quot;Sharon's big hang-up&quot;. He reminded her that she had promised not to change him.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate accepted his conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped that he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, &quot;We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Evans |title=Sufferings of the great seducer |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article547335.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1254102174470 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114045046/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article547335.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1254102174470 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 14, 2013 |work=The Sunday Times |date=July 24, 2005 |access-date=August 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff, and she began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her that he wanted to be married to &quot;a hippie, not a housewife.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry, including [[Warren Beatty]], [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Joan Collins]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Laurence Harvey]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Joanna Pettet]], and [[Peter Sellers]]; older film stars such as [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Henry Fonda]], and [[Danny Kaye]]; musicians such as [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and record producer [[Terry Melcher]] and his girlfriend [[Candice Bergen]]. Jay Sebring remained one of the couple's more frequent companions. Polanski's friends included [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]], whom Polanski had known since his youth in Poland, and Frykowski's girlfriend [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]] the coffee heiress. Tate and Polanski moved into the [[Chateau Marmont]] in Los Angeles for a few months{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} until they arranged to lease [[Patty Duke]]'s home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the &quot;free spirit&quot; of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was &quot;live and let live.&quot;{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} Her close friend [[Leslie Caron]] commented that the Polanskis were too trusting, &quot;to the point of recklessness&quot;, and that she had been alarmed by it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ellisamburn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Ellis Amburn |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |title=The Sexiest Man Alive: A Biography of Warren Beatty |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vgqPOQAACAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=1-85227-919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1968, Tate began ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' (1969), a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an accident-prone spy who was also a romantic interest for star [[Dean Martin]], playing [[Matt Helm]]. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by [[Bruce Lee]]. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. ''The New York Times'' critic Vincent Canby criticized the film, but wrote, &quot;The only nice thing is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vincent |last=Canby |title=The Screen: Matt Helm Back in Town |work=The New York Times |date=February 6, 1969 |access-date=October 10, 2009 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9E07E3DC1E30EE3BBC4E53DFB4668382679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin commented that he intended to make another &quot;Matt Helm&quot; film and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role. 

Around this time, Tate was feted as a promising newcomer. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] as &quot;New Star of the Year – Actress&quot; for her performance in ''Valley of the Dolls'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30188 |title=Sharon Tate |publisher=Golden Globes.org |access-date=July 16, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524205629/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30188 |archive-date=May 24, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and she placed fourth behind [[Mia Farrow]], [[Judy Geeson]], and [[Katharine Houghton]] for a &quot;Golden [[Laurel Awards|Laurel&quot; award]] as the year's &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Laurel_Awards/1968 |title=Golden Laurel Awards 1968 |access-date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also runner-up to [[Lynn Redgrave]] in the ''Motion Picture Herald''{{'}}s poll for &quot;The Star of Tomorrow,&quot; in which box-office drawing power was the main criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sharontate.net/bio4.html |title= Sharon's Biography — The Tide Turns |publisher=SharonTate.net |access-date=July 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicated that her career was beginning to accelerate, and she negotiated a fee of $150,000 for her next film.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

She became pregnant near the end of 1968, and she and Polanski moved to [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles]] on February 15, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt; The house had previously been occupied by their friends [[Terry Melcher]] and [[Candice Bergen]]. Tate and Polanski had visited it several times, and Tate was thrilled to learn that it was available, referring to it as her &quot;love house.&quot; At their new home, the Polanskis continued to be popular hosts for their large group of friends, although some of them still worried about the strange people who continued to show up at their parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming1981&quot; /&gt; Tate was encouraged by the positive reviews of her comedic performances and chose the comedy ''Twelve Plus One'' (1969) as her next project, largely for the opportunity to co-star with [[Orson Welles]]. In March 1969, she traveled to Italy to begin filming, and Polanski went to London to work on ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'' (1973). 

Frykowski and Folger moved into the Cielo Drive house. After completing ''Twelve Plus One'', Tate joined Polanski in London. She posed in their apartment for photographer [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]] in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and she completed a series of glamor photographs for the British magazine ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]''. She returned from London to Los Angeles on July 20, 1969 on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. Polanski was due to return on August 12 in time for the birth, and he had asked Frykowski and Folger to stay in the house with Tate until his return.&lt;ref&gt;''Horror and Those Who Caused It'' {{ISBN|978-0-648-13682-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 1969, Tate entertained friends actress [[Joanna Pettet]] and Barbara Lewis for lunch at her home, confiding in them her disappointment at Polanski's delay in returning from London. Polanski telephoned her that day, as did her younger sister Debra who called to ask if she, her boyfriend and another friend could come by to pick up a saddle Sharon had purchased for Debra in Europe. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, she dined at [[El Coyote Cafe]] with [[Jay Sebring]], [[Wojciech Frykowski]], and [[Abigail Folger]], returning at about 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Members of [[Charles Manson]]'s &quot;[[Manson Family|family]]&quot; murdered Tate, Sebring, Frykowski and Folger shortly after midnight. Their bodies were discovered the following morning by Tate's housekeeper Winifred Chapman. Police arrived at the scene to find a young man shot dead in his car in the driveway, later identified as [[Tate murders|Steven Parent]]. Inside the house, the bodies of Tate and Sebring were found in the living room; a long rope tied around each of their necks connected them. On the front lawn lay the bodies of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims except Parent had been stabbed numerous times. The coroner's report for Tate noted that she had been stabbed 16 times and that &quot;five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BugliosiGentry1974&quot; /&gt;

Police took the only survivor at the address in for questioning, the property's caretaker [[Tate–LaBianca murders|William Garretson]]. Garretson lived in the guest house that was located on the property a short distance from the house. He was questioned and submitted to a [[polygraph]] test and stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and left shortly after. He informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.

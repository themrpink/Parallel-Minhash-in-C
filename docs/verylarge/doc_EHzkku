On 30 June 1688—the same day the bishops were acquitted—a group of political figures, known afterward as the &quot;[[Immortal Seven]]&quot;, sent William a [[invitation to William|formal invitation]].&lt;ref name= troost191 /&gt; William's intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 193–196&lt;/ref&gt; With a Dutch army, William landed at [[Brixham]] in southwest England on 5 November 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 200–203; van der Kiste, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; He came ashore from the ship ''[[Brielle|Brill]]'', proclaiming &quot;the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain&quot;. William's fleet was vastly larger than the [[Spanish Armada]] 100 years earlier: approximately 250 carrier ships and 60 fishing boats carried 35,000 men, including 11,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 105; Machiel Bosman, &quot;De Roofkoning. Prins Willem III en de invasie van Engeland&quot; (2016), pages 156, 214–16. The Spanish Armada counted 130 ships and 25,000 men&lt;/ref&gt; James's support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William's arrival; [[List of James II deserters to William of Orange|Protestant officers defected from the English army]] (the most notable of whom was [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill of Eyemouth]], James's most able commander), and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader.&lt;ref name=troost204&gt;Troost, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

James at first attempted to resist William, but saw that his efforts would prove futile.&lt;ref name=troost204/&gt; He sent representatives to negotiate with William, but secretly attempted to flee on 11/21 December, throwing the [[Great Seal of England|Great Seal]] into the [[Thames]] on his way.&lt;ref name= troost205&gt;Troost, 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; He was discovered and brought back to London by a group of fishermen.&lt;ref name= troost205 /&gt; He was allowed to leave for France in a second escape attempt on 23 December.&lt;ref name= troost205 /&gt; William permitted James to leave the country, not wanting to make him a [[martyr]] for the Roman Catholic cause; it was in his interests for James to be perceived as having left the country of his own accord, rather than having been forced or frightened into fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, 242–246; Miller, 208&lt;/ref&gt; William is the last person to successfully invade England by force of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dutch role in the Glorious Revolution | first = Jonathan | last = Israel |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=105 |isbn= 0-521-39075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclaimed king===
[[File:King William III by Thomas Murray.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait attributed to [[Thomas Murray (artist)|Thomas Murray]], c. 1690]]

William summoned a [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight.&lt;ref name=davies614&gt;Davies, 614–615&lt;/ref&gt; William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere [[King consort|consort]].&lt;ref name=troost207&gt;Troost, 207–210&lt;/ref&gt; The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 469; Israel, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; When the majority of [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately. Furthermore, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] majority, quickly resolved that the throne was vacant, and that it was safer if the ruler were Protestant. There were more Tories in the [[House of Lords]], which would not initially agree, but after William refused to be a [[regent]] or to agree to remain king only in his wife's lifetime, there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant. On 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee, had abdicated the government of the realm, thereby leaving the throne vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 210–212&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown was not offered to James's infant son, who would have been the [[heir apparent]] under normal circumstances, but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns.&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt; It was, however, provided that &quot;the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt;

William and Mary were crowned together at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 11 April 1689 by the [[Bishop of London]], [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]].&lt;ref name=troost219&gt;Troost, 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the coronation is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but the Archbishop at the time, [[William Sancroft]], refused to recognise James's removal.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt;

William also summoned a Convention of the [[Estates of Scotland]], which met on 14 March 1689 and sent a conciliatory letter, while James sent haughty uncompromising orders, swaying a majority in favour of William. On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown; they accepted on 11 May.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 614–615. William was &quot;William II&quot; of Scotland, for there was only one previous Scottish king named [[William I of Scotland|William]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution settlement===
[[File:William&amp;MaryEngraving1703.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving depicting the king, queen, throne, and arms|upright|Engraving of William III and Mary II, 1703]]
William encouraged the passage of the [[Toleration Act 1689]], which guaranteed [[religious toleration]] to Protestant [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]].&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt; It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the [[religious liberty]] of Roman Catholics, [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarians]], and those of non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt; In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.&lt;ref name=vdk114&gt;Van der Kiste, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the [[right to petition]], raise a [[standing army]] during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the [[right to bear arms]] to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require [[excessive bail]] or inflict [[cruel and unusual punishments]].&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt; William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II's sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], and her issue, followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt; Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt;

==Rule with Mary II==

===Resistance to validity of rule===

Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the [[divine right of kings]], which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjurors]] in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the [[Church of England]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.

[[File:De slag aan de Boyne (Ierland) tussen Jacobus II en Willem III, 12 juli 1690 Rijksmuseum SK-A-605.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of a battle scene|''[[Battle of the Boyne]] between James II and William III, 12 July 1690'', [[Jan van Huchtenburg]]]]

Ireland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James, and [[Jacobitism|Franco-Irish Jacobites]] arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the [[Williamite war in Ireland|war in Ireland]] and contest Protestant resistance at the [[Siege of Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Derry.php |title=The Siege of Derry (1688–1689) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; William sent his navy to the city in July, and his army [[Siege of Carrickfergus|landed in August]]. After progress stalled, William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on 1 July 1690,{{efn|Due to the change to the [[Gregorian calendar]], William's victory is commemorated annually by Northern Irish and Scottish Protestants on [[The Twelfth]] of July – cf. Troost, 278–280}} after which James fled back to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Boyne.php |title=The Battle of the Boyne (1689–1690) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon William's return to England, his close friend [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Dutch General Godert de Ginkell]], who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne, was named Commander in Chief of William's forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there. Ginkell took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691, and following several ensuing battles, succeeded in capturing both [[Galway]] and [[Limerick]], thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months. After difficult negotiations a [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] was signed on 3 October 1691—the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland, and for his services the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and was awarded the title of [[Earl of Athlone]] by the king.

A series of [[Jacobite rising of 1689|Jacobite risings]] also took place in Scotland, where [[John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee|Viscount Dundee]] raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]], but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian]] forces subdued the rising at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 270–273&lt;/ref&gt; William offered [[Scottish clan]]s that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided that they signed allegiance by a deadline, and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] of 1692, which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders.&lt;ref name=troost274&gt;Troost, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beebunion&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/features_union_restoration2.shtml |title=BBC – History – Scottish History – Restoration and Revolution (II) |work=The Making of the Union |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowing to public opinion, William dismissed those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour; in the words of the historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|John Dalberg-Acton]], &quot;one became a colonel, another a knight, a third a peer, and a fourth an [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|earl]].&quot;&lt;ref name=troost274/&gt;

William's reputation in Scotland suffered further damage when he refused English assistance to the [[Darien scheme]], a Scottish colony (1698–1700) that failed disastrously.&lt;ref name=beebjac&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/scotland_jacobites_01.shtml |title= BBC – History – British History in depth: The Jacobite Cause |accessdate= 9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament and faction===
[[File:William III Silver Coin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A silver coin picturing William III and his coat of arms|Silver [[Crown (British coin)|Crown coin]], 1695. The Latin inscription is (obverse) ''GVLIELMVS III DEI GRA[TIA]'' (reverse) ''MAG[NAE] BR[ITANNIAE], FRA[NCIAE], ET HIB[ERNIAE] REX 1695''. English: &quot;William III, By the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, 1695.&quot; The reverse shows the arms, clockwise from top, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, centred on William's personal arms of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].]]

Although the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 221&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;balanced&quot; approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 222; van der Zee, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1690 English general election|Parliamentary elections of 1690]], William began to favour the Tories, led by [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Danby]] and [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 223–227&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tories favoured preserving the king's prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 226&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the [[Whig Junto|Junto]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 228–232&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the [[Bank of England]] following the example of the [[Bank of Amsterdam]]. William's decision to grant the [[Royal Charter]] in 1694 to the Bank of England, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; It laid the financial foundation of the English take-over of the central role of the [[Dutch Republic]] and Bank of Amsterdam in global commerce in the 18th century.

William dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs. There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a Jacobite plan to assassinate him in 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed a [[bill of attainder]] against the ringleader, [[Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet|John Fenwick]], and he was beheaded in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Europe===
{{Main|Nine Years' War}}
William continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 239–241; van der Zee, 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 241–246&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice. Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 150–158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at [[Battle of La Hougue|La Hogue]] in 1692, the allies for a short period controlled the seas, and the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (1691) pacified Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 281–283&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1692, and the French under the command of the [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Duke of Luxembourg]] beat him badly at the [[Battle of Landen]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Willem III, prins van Oranje, koning van Engeland en stadhouder Rijksmuseum SK-A-367.jpeg|thumb| William III painted in the 1690s by [[Godfried Schalcken]]]]
Mary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, leaving William III to rule alone.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; William deeply mourned his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 180–184&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his conversion to [[Anglicanism]], William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 186–192; Troost, 226–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of homosexuality===
During the 1690s rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] detractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Culture and Society in Britain | editor-first = J | editor-last = Black | place = Manchester | year = 1997 | page = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]] became [[Earl of Portland]], and [[Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Arnold Joost van Keppel]] was created [[Earl of Albemarle]]. These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships. William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations. Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours,&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 25–26; Van der Zee, 421–423&lt;/ref&gt; while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, and that there was nothing unusual in someone childless like William adopting or evincing paternal affections for a younger man.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 204–205; Baxter, 352; {{Citation | first = James | last = Falkner | contribution = Keppel, Arnold Joost van, first earl of Albemarle (1669/70–1718) | title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case, Bentinck's closeness to William did arouse jealousies at the royal court. William's young protegé, [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Keppel]], aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William's junior, strikingly handsome, and having risen from the post of a royal page to an earldom with some ease.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Portland wrote to William in 1697 that &quot;the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties&amp;nbsp;... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear.&quot;&lt;ref name= vdk202&gt;Van der Kiste, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, was &quot;tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations&quot;. William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, &quot;It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal.&quot;&lt;ref name=vdk202/&gt;

===Peace with France===
[[File:Lord Justices of England.jpg|alt= Black-and-white depiction of six small portraits arrayed in a circle around a larger portrait|thumb|left| Engraving from 1695 showing the [[Lord Justices]] who administered the kingdom while William was on campaign]]
In 1696 the Dutch territory of [[Drenthe]] made William its Stadtholder. In the same year,  [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696|Jacobites plotted]] to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne, but failed. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] (20 September 1697), which ended the [[Nine Years' War]], Louis recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.

As his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other contemporary European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[New World]]. The King of Spain,  [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], was an invalid with no prospect of having children; some of his closest relatives included Louis XIV (the King of France) and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. William and Louis XIV agreed to the [[First Partition Treaty]] (1698), which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire: [[Joseph Ferdinand, Electoral Prince of Bavaria]], would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 253–255&lt;/ref&gt; Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|alt= Portrait of Louis XIV of France, standing, wearing an ermine robed faced with fleur-de-lis| [[Louis XIV of France]], William's lifelong enemy]]

When, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox in February 1699, the issue re-opened. In 1700 William and Louis XIV agreed to the  [[Treaty of London, 1700|Second Partition Treaty]] (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=troost256&gt;Troost, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, who regarded the Italian territories as much more useful than the other lands.&lt;ref name=troost256/&gt; Unexpectedly, the invalid King of Spain, Charles II, interfered as he lay dying in late 1700.&lt;ref name=troost258&gt;Troost, 258–260&lt;/ref&gt; Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to  [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]] the [[Duke of Anjou]], a grandson of Louis XIV. The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance.&lt;ref name=troost258/&gt; Furthermore, Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the son of the former King James II (who died in September 1701), as ''de jure'' King of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 260&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent conflict, known as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out in July 1701 and continued until 1713/1714.

===English royal succession===
Another royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child ([[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]]) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 234&lt;/ref&gt; As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, Parliament passed the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover]] (a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James I]]) and to her Protestant heirs.&lt;ref name=troost235&gt;Troost, 235&lt;/ref&gt; The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the [[Jacobite line of succession to the English and Scottish thrones in 1714|candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne]] than Sophia. The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia.&lt;ref name=troost235/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Bristol statue william III 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Statue of William III on a horse|Statue of an idealised William III by [[John Michael Rysbrack]] erected in [[Queen Square, Bristol]], in 1736]]

In 1702, William died of [[pneumonia]], a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. The horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; Because his horse had stumbled into a [[mole (animal)|mole's]] burrow, many Jacobites toasted &quot;the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 255&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, [[Winston Churchill]], in his ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', stated that the fall &quot;opened the door to a troop of lurking foes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; William was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] alongside his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106223703/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archivedate=6 January 2008|title=William III|publisher=Westminster Abbey Official site|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister-in-law and cousin, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], became [[queen regnant]] of England, Scotland and Ireland.

William's death meant that he would remain the only member of the Dutch [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] to reign over England. Members of this House had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of [[William the Silent]] (William I). The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death. Thus, he was the last [[agnatic|patrilineal]] descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces. Under William III's will, [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso]] stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 959–960&lt;/ref&gt; He was William's closest agnatic relative, as well as grandson of William's aunt [[Countess Henriette Catherine of Nassau|Henriette Catherine]]. However, King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] also claimed the Principality as the senior [[Primogeniture|cognatic]] heir, his mother [[Countess Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]] being Henriette Catherine's older sister.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 962, 968&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), Frederick I's successor, [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], ceded his territorial claim to King [[Louis XIV of France]], keeping only a claim to the title. Friso's posthumous son, [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]], succeeded to the title at his birth in 1711; in the [[Treaty of Partition]] (1732) he agreed to share the title &quot;Prince of Orange&quot; with Frederick William.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 991–992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/berlin1732.htm|title=Text of the Treaty of Partition|language=French|publisher=Heraldica|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William's primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe. His life's aim was largely to oppose [[Louis XIV of France]]. This effort continued after his death during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Another important consequence of William's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], [[James I of England|James I]], in 1603. The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the [[English Civil War]] during the 1640s and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref name=claydon3&gt;Claydon, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; During William's reign, however, the conflict was settled in Parliament's favour by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Triennial Act 1694]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref name=claydon3/&gt;

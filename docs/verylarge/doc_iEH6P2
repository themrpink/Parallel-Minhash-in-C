Burgess lived for two years in the United States, working as a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] with the creative writing program (1970) and as a distinguished professor at the [[City College of New York]] (1972). At City College he was a close colleague and friend of [[Joseph Heller]]. He went on to teach creative writing at [[Columbia University]] and was writer-in-residence at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1969) and at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] (1976). He lectured on the novel at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1975. Eventually he settled in [[Monaco]] in 1976, where he was active in the local community, becoming a co-founder in 1984 of the [[Princess Grace Irish Library]], a centre for Irish cultural studies.

In May 1988, Burgess made an [[After Dark (TV series)#&quot;What is Sex For?&quot;|extended appearance]] with, among others, [[Andrea Dworkin]] on the episode ''What Is Sex For?'' of discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''. He spoke at one point about divorce: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Liking involves no discipline; love does{{nbsp}}... A marriage, say that lasts twenty years or more, is a kind of civilisation, a kind of microcosm - it develops its own language, its own semiotics, its own slang, its own shorthand{{nbsp}}... sex is part of it, part of the semiotics. To destroy, wantonly, such a relationship, is like destroying a whole civilisation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anthony McCarthy (2016), ''Ethical Sex'', Fidelity Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Burgess lived not far from [[Graham Greene]], whose house was in [[Antibes]], Greene became aggrieved shortly before his death by comments in newspaper articles by Burgess, and broke off all contact.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Gore Vidal]] revealed in his 2006 memoir ''Point to Point Navigation'' that Greene disapproved of Burgess's appearance on various European television stations to discuss his (Burgess') books.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Vidal recounts that Greene apparently regarded a willingness to appear on television as something that ought to be beneath a writer's dignity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; &quot;He talks about his books&quot;, Vidal quotes an exasperated Greene as saying.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

During this time, Burgess spent much time at his chalet two kilometres outside [[Lugano]], Switzerland.

===Death===
[[File:ABABBAABBA Monaco.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Burgess's grave marker at the [[Columbarium]] in Monaco's cemetery.]]
Burgess wrote: &quot;I shall die somewhere in the Mediterranean lands, with an inaccurate obituary in the ''[[Nice-Matin]]'', unmourned, soon forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ilovemanchester.com/2015/09/09/anthony-burgess-manchesters-neglected-hero.aspx|title=Anthony Burgess - Manchester's Neglected Hero?|last=Fitzgerald|first=Laurence|date=9 September 2015|work=I Love Manchester|access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Burgess died in the country of his birth. He returned to [[Twickenham]], an outer suburb of London, where he owned a house, to await death. Burgess died on 22 November 1993 from [[lung cancer]], at the [[St John's Wood|Hospital of St John &amp; St Elizabeth]] in London. His ashes were inurned at the [[Monaco Cemetery]].

The epitaph on Burgess's marble memorial stone, reads: &quot;Abba Abba&quot; which means &quot;Father, father&quot; in Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages and is pronounced by [[Jesus|Christ]] during his agony in [[Gethsemane]] (Mark 14:36) as he prays God to spare him. It is also [[Abba Abba|the title of Burgess's 22nd novel]], concerning the death of [[John Keats]]. Eulogies at his memorial service at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]], London in 1994 were delivered by the journalist [[Auberon Waugh]] and the novelist [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} ''The Times'' obituary heralded the author as &quot;a great moralist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthony Burgess&quot;, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt; His estate was worth US$3 million, and included a large European property portfolio of houses and apartments.&lt;ref name=TelegDec07/&gt;

==Life in music==
An accomplished musician, Burgess composed regularly throughout his life, and once said: {{quote|&quot;I wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Clemons, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TyMcAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22musician+who%22 &quot;Anthony Burgess: Pushing On&quot;], ''New York Times Book Review'', 29 November 1970, p. 2. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on [[BBC Radio]]. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the [[University of Iowa]] orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his ''[[Sinfoni Melayu]]'' as an attempt to &quot;combine the musical elements of the country into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones.&quot; The structure of ''[[Napoleon Symphony|Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in Four Movements]]'' (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica symphony]], while ''[[Mozart and the Wolf Gang]]'' (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No.40]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] features prominently in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and in [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Stanley Kubrick's film version]] of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in ''This Man and Music''. He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and &quot;Tre Pezzetti&quot; have been included on a major CD release from recorder player John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled ''Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Metier records, release September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgess produced a translation of [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]]'s libretto to [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', which was performed by the [[English National Opera]], and wrote for the 1973 Broadway musical ''[[Cyrano (musical)|Cyrano]]'', using his own adaptation of the original [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand]] play as his basis. He created ''[[Blooms of Dublin]]'' in 1982, an [[operetta]] based on [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (televised for the BBC) and wrote a libretto for Weber's ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'', performed by the Glasgow-based [[Scottish Opera]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On the BBC's ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' radio programme in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthony Burgess|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/dc3f4365#p009y34z|work=Desert Island Discs|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess chose as his favourite music [[Henry Purcell|Purcell's]] &quot;Rejoice in the Lord Alway&quot;; [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' No. 13; [[Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1 in A-flat major]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] &quot;Walter's Trial Song&quot; from ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''; [[Claude Debussy|Debussy's]] &quot;Fêtes&quot; from ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]''; [[Constant Lambert|Lambert's]] ''[[The Rio Grande (Lambert)|The Rio Grande]]''; [[William Walton|Walton's]] [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|Symphony No. 1 in B-flat minor]]; and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams']] ''On Wenlock Edge''.

==Linguistics==
&quot;Burgess's linguistic training&quot;, wrote Raymond Chapman and Tom McArthur in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'': &quot;...{{nbsp}}is shown in dialogue enriched by distinctive pronunciations and the niceties of register.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} During his years in Malaya, and after he had mastered [[Jawi script|Jawi]], the Arabic script adapted for Malay, Burgess taught himself the [[Persian language]], after which he produced a translation of Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'' into Persian (unpublished). He worked on an anthology of the best of English literature translated into Malay, which failed to achieve publication. Burgess's published translations include two versions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rostand |first=Edmond |author2=Anthony Burgess |title=Cyrano de Bergerac, translated and adapted by Anthony Burgess |publisher=Nick Hern Books |year=1991 |edition=New |isbn=978-1-85459-117-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus the King]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-0816606672 |title=Oedipus the King. (Minnesota drama editions) (9780816606672): Anthony Burgess: Books |year=1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Carmen]]''.

Burgess's interest in language was reflected in the invented, Anglo-Russian teen slang of ''A Clockwork Orange'' ([[Nadsat]]), and in the movie ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]'' (1981), for which he [[Constructed language|invented]] a prehistoric language (''Ulam'') for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In ''[[The Doctor is Sick]]'', Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with &quot;brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech.&quot; Burgess, who had lectured on phonetics at the University of Birmingham in the late 1940s, investigates the field of linguistics in ''[[Language Made Plain]]'' and ''[[A Mouthful of Air]]''.

The depth of Burgess's multilingual proficiency came under discussion in [[Roger Lewis]]'s [[Anthony Burgess: A Life|2002 biography]]. Lewis claimed that during production in Malaysia of the BBC documentary ''A Kind of Failure'' (1982), Burgess's supposedly fluent Malay was not understood by waitresses at a restaurant where they were filming. It was claimed that the documentary's director deliberately kept these moments intact in the film to expose Burgess's linguistic pretensions. A letter from David Wallace that appeared in the magazine of the London ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' newspaper on 25 November 2002 shed light on the affair. Wallace's letter read, in part:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the tale was inaccurate. It tells of Burgess, the great linguist, &quot;bellowing Malay at a succession of Malayan waitresses&quot; but &quot;unable to make himself understood&quot;. The source of this tale was a 20-year-old BBC documentary&amp;nbsp;... [The suggestion was] that the director left the scene in, in order to poke fun at the great author. Not so, and I can be sure, as I was that director&amp;nbsp;... The story as seen on television made it clear that Burgess knew that these waitresses were not Malay. It was a Chinese restaurant and Burgess's point was that the ethnic Chinese had little time for the government-enforced national language, [[Bahasa Malaysia]] [i.e. Malay]. Burgess may well have had an accent, but he did speak the language; it was the girls in question who did not.}}

Lewis may not have been fully aware of the fact that a quarter of Malaysia's population is made up of [[Min Nan|Hokkien]]- and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]-speaking [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]]. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the passing of the [[Language Act]] of 1967. By 1982 all national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia would have been teaching with [[Bahasa Melayu]] as a base language (see [[Harold Crouch]], ''Government and Society in Malaysia'', Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).

==Work==
===Novels===
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
His Malayan trilogy ''[[The Long Day Wanes]]'' was Burgess's first published fiction. Its three books are ''[[Time for a Tiger]],'' ''[[The Enemy in the Blanket]]'' and ''[[Beds in the East]].'' ''[[Devil of a State]]'' is a follow-on to the trilogy, set in a fictionalised version of [[Brunei]]. It was Burgess's ambition to become &quot;the true fictional expert on Malaya.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In these works, Burgess was working in the tradition established by [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] for British India, and [[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]] and [[W. Somerset Maugham|Maugham]] for Southeast Asia. Burgess operated more in the mode of Orwell, who had a good command of [[Urdu]] and [[Burmese language|Burmese]] (necessary for Orwell's work as a police officer) and Kipling, who spoke [[Hindi]] (having learnt it as a child). Like many of his fellow English expatriates in Asia, Burgess had excellent spoken and written command of his operative language(s), both as a novelist and as a speaker, including [[Malay language|Malay]].

Burgess's repatriate years (c. 1960–69) produced ''[[Inside Mr. Enderby|Enderby]]'' and ''[[The Right to an Answer]],'' which touches on the theme of death and dying, and ''[[One Hand Clapping (novel)|One Hand Clapping]],'' a satire on the vacuity of popular culture. ''[[The Worm and the Ring]]'' (1961) had to be withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess's former colleagues, a school secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His dystopian novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' was published in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the Second World War in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted and violated by deserters from the US Army in London during the blackout. The event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young [[anti-hero]], [[Alex DeLarge|Alex]], captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of [[aversion therapy]] treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book ''Flame into Being'' (1985) Burgess described ''A Clockwork Orange'' as &quot;a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence.&quot; He added &quot;the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die.&quot; In a 1980 BBC interview Burgess distanced himself from the novel and cinematic adaptations.  
Near the time of publication the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book. Burgess had written ''A Clockwork Orange'' with twenty-one chapters, meaning to match the [[age of majority]]. &quot;21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility,&quot; Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was &quot;being charitable in accepting the work at all,&quot; Burgess accepted the deal and allowed ''A Clockwork Orange'' to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter.  

In [[Martin Seymour-Smith]]'s ''Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction,'' Burgess related that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project. Seymour-Smith wrote: {{quote|&quot;Burgess believes overplanning is fatal to creativity and regards his unconscious mind and the act of writing itself as indispensable guides. He does not produce a draft of a whole novel but prefers to get one page finished before he goes on to the next, which involves a good deal of revision and correction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Stephen D |title=A Dictionary of Made-Up Languages |date=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4405-2817-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTXrDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Burgess+believes+overplanning+is+fatal+to+creativity+and+regards+his+unconscious+mind+and+the+act+of+writing+itself+as+indispensable+guides.+He+does+not+produce+a+draft+of+a+whole+novel+but+prefers+to+get+one+page+finished+before+he+goes+on+to+the+next,+which+involves+a+good+deal+of+revision+and+correction&amp;pg=PT350 |accessdate=3 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]]'' is a fictional recreation of [[Shakespeare]]'s love-life and an examination of the supposedly partly syphilitic sources of the bard's imaginative vision. The novel, which drew on [[Edgar I. Fripp]]'s 1938 biography ''Shakespeare, Man and artist,'' won critical acclaim and placed Burgess among the first rank novelists of his generation. ''[[M/F]]'' (1971) was listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud. ''[[Beard's Roman Women]]'' was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage. In ''[[Napoleon Symphony]],'' Burgess brought [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] to life by shaping the novel's structure to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' symphony. The novel contains a portrait of an [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] society under occupation by a Christian western power ([[Egypt]] by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[First French Empire|France]]). In the 1980s, religious themes began to feature heavily (''[[The Kingdom of the Wicked]],'' ''[[Man of Nazareth]],'' ''[[Earthly Powers]]''). Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic &quot;training&quot; and worldview remained strong in his work all his life. This is notable in the discussion of free will in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the Catholic Church&amp;nbsp;– due to what can be understood as Satanic influence&amp;nbsp;– in ''Earthly Powers'' (1980).

Burgess kept working through his final illness and was writing on his deathbed. The late novel ''[[Any Old Iron (novel)|Any Old Iron]]'' is a generational saga of two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish, encompassing the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the early years of the State of Israel, and the rediscovery of [[Excalibur]]. ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]],'' about [[Christopher Marlowe]], is a companion novel to ''[[Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love Life|Nothing Like the Sun]].'' The verse novel ''[[Byrne: A Novel|Byrne]]'' was published posthumously.

Burgess announced in a 1972 interview that he was writing a novel about the Black Prince which incorporated [[John Dos Passos]]' narrative techniques, although he never finished writing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interviewed by John Cullinan |url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3994/the-art-of-fiction-no-48-anthony-burgess |title=The Art of Fiction No. 48, Anthony Burgess |publisher=Paris Review |date=2 December 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Burgess's death, English writer [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]] completed this novel, and it was published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Adam |author2=Anthony Burgess |title=The Black Prince |publisher=Unbound |year=2018 |edition=New |isbn=978-1-78352-647-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, a previously unpublished analysis of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was discovered titled, &quot;The Clockwork Condition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/a-clockwork-orange-sequel-scli-gbr-intl/index.html|title=Lost 'A Clockwork Orange' sequel discovered in author's archives|first=Rob|last=Picheta|date=25 April 2019|website=CNN Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is structured as Burgess' philosophical musings on the novel that won him so much acclaim.

===Critical studies===
Burgess started his career as a critic. His ''English Literature, A Survey for Students'', was aimed at newcomers to the subject. He followed this with ''The Novel To-day'' (Longmans, 1963) and ''The Novel Now: A Student's Guide to Contemporary Fiction'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1967). He wrote the [[James Joyce|Joyce]] studies ''Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader'' (also published as ''Re Joyce'') and ''[[Joysprick|Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce]]''. Also published was ''A Shorter '[[Finnegans Wake]]'',' Burgess's abridgement. His 1970 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' entry on the novel (under &quot;[https://www.britannica.com/art/novel Novel, the]&quot;) is regarded as a classic of the genre.{{By whom|date=September 2010}} Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D. H. Lawrence, as well as ''[[Ninety-nine Novels]]: The Best in English since 1939''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neglectedbooks.com/?page_id=54 The Neglected Books Page], neglectedbooks.com; accessed 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenwriting===
Burgess wrote the screenplays for ''[[Moses the Lawgiver]]'' (Gianfranco De Bosio 1974), ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' ([[Franco Zeffirelli]] 1977), and ''[[A.D. (miniseries)|A.D.]]'' ([[Stuart Cooper]], 1985). Burgess was co-writer of the script for the TV series ''Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson'' (1980). The [[film treatment]]s he produced include ''[[Amundsen]]'', ''[[Attila]]'', ''[[The Black Prince]]'', ''[[Cyrus the Great]]'', ''Dawn Chorus'', ''The Dirty Tricks of Bertoldo'', ''Eternal Life'', ''Onassis'', ''Puma'', ''Samson and Delilah'', ''Schreber'', ''The Sexual Habits of the English Middle Class'', ''Shah'', ''That Man Freud'' and ''Uncle Ludwig''. Burgess devised a [[Stone Age]] language for ''[[La Guerre du Feu (film)|La Guerre du Feu]]'' (''Quest for Fire''; [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], 1981).

Burgess wrote many unpublished scripts, including ''Will!'' or ''The Bawdy Bard'' about Shakespeare, based on the novel ''Nothing Like The Sun''. Encouraged by the success of ''[[Tremor of Intent: An Eschatological Spy Novel|Tremor of Intent]]'' (a parody of [[James Bond]] adventures), Burgess wrote a screenplay for ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', also rejected,&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Steven Jay|title=The James Bond films: a behind the scenes history|url=https://archive.org/details/jamesbondfilmsbe0000rubi|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=Arlington House|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-87000-523-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the huge submarine silo seen in the finished film was reportedly Burgess's inspiration.&lt;ref name=barnes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Alan|title=Kiss Kiss Bang!

'''Grid computing''' is the use of widely distributed [[computer]] [[System resource|resources]] to reach a common goal. A computing grid can be thought of as a [[distributed system]] with non-interactive workloads that involve many files. Grid computing is distinguished from conventional high-performance computing systems such as [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] computing in that grid computers have each node set to perform a different task/application. Grid computers also tend to be more [[heterogeneous]] and geographically dispersed (thus not physically coupled) than cluster computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-sciencecity.org/EN/gridcafe/what-is-the-grid.html What is grid computing? - Gridcafe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210072831/http://www.e-sciencecity.org/EN/gridcafe/what-is-the-grid.html |date=2013-02-10 }}. E-sciencecity.org. Retrieved 2013-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application, commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes. Grids are often constructed with general-purpose grid [[middleware]] software libraries. Grid sizes can be quite large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2339444/software/scale-grid-computing-down-to-size.html |title=Scale grid computing down to size |publisher=NetworkWorld.com |date=2003-01-27 |access-date=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grids are a form of [[distributed computing]] whereby a &quot;super virtual computer&quot; is composed of many networked [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]] computers acting together to perform large tasks. For certain applications, distributed or grid computing can be seen as a special type of [[parallel computing]] that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a [[computer network]] (private or public) by a conventional [[Network interface controller|network interface]], such as [[Ethernet]]. This is in contrast to the traditional notion of a [[supercomputer]], which has many processors connected by a local high-speed [[computer bus]].

==Overview==
Grid computing combines computers from multiple administrative domains to reach a common goal,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.cs.odu.edu/WhatIsTheGrid.pdf|title=What is the Grid? A Three Point Checklist}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve a single task, and may then disappear just as quickly.

The size of a grid may vary from small—confined to a network of computer workstations within a corporation, for example—to large, public collaborations across many companies and networks. &quot;The notion of a confined grid may also be known as an intra-nodes cooperation whereas the notion of a larger, wider grid may thus refer to an inter-nodes cooperation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diuf.unifr.ch/pai/wiki/doku.php?id=Publications&amp;page=publication&amp;kind=single&amp;ID=276 |title=Pervasive and Artificial Intelligence Group :: publications [Pervasive and Artificial Intelligence Research Group&amp;#93; |publisher=Diuf.unifr.ch |date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=July 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004350/http://diuf.unifr.ch/pai/wiki/doku.php?id=Publications&amp;page=publication&amp;kind=single&amp;ID=276 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grids are a form of [[distributed computing]] whereby a “super virtual computer” is composed of many networked [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]] computers acting together to perform very large tasks. This technology has been applied to computationally intensive scientific, mathematical, and academic problems through [[volunteer computing]], and it is used in commercial enterprises for such diverse applications as [[drug discovery]], [[economic forecasting]], [[seismic analysis]], and [[back office]] data processing in support for [[e-commerce]] and [[Web service]]s.

Coordinating applications on Grids can be a complex task, especially when coordinating the flow of information across distributed computing resources. [[Scientific workflow system|Grid workflow]] systems have been developed as a specialized form of a [[workflow management system]] designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in the grid context.

==Comparison of grids and conventional supercomputers==
“Distributed” or “grid” computing in general is a special type of [[parallel computing]] that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a [[computer network|network]] (private, public or the [[Internet]]) by a conventional [[Network interface controller|network interface]] producing commodity hardware, compared to the lower efficiency of designing and constructing a small number of custom supercomputers. The primary performance disadvantage is that the various processors and local storage areas do not have high-speed connections. This arrangement is thus well-suited to applications in which multiple parallel computations can take place independently, without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-sciencecity.org/EN/gridcafe/computational-problems.html Computational problems - Gridcafe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825003633/http://www.e-sciencecity.org/EN/gridcafe/computational-problems.html |date=2012-08-25 }}. E-sciencecity.org. Retrieved 2013-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-end [[scalability]] of geographically dispersed grids is generally favorable, due to the low need for connectivity between [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] relative to the capacity of the public Internet.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

There are also some differences in programming and MC.{{clarify|date=July 2019}} It can be costly and difficult to write programs that can run in the environment of a supercomputer, which may have a custom operating system, or require the program to address [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] issues. If a problem can be adequately parallelized, a “thin” layer of “grid” infrastructure can allow conventional, standalone programs, given a different part of the same problem, to run on multiple machines. This makes it possible to write and debug on a single conventional machine and eliminates complications due to multiple instances of the same program running in the same shared [[computer memory|memory]] and storage space at the same time.

==Design considerations and variations==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
One feature of distributed grids is that they can be formed from computing resources belonging to one or more multiple individuals or organizations (known as multiple [[administrative domain]]s). This can facilitate commercial transactions, as in [[utility computing]], or make it easier to assemble [[volunteer computing]] networks.

One disadvantage of this feature is that the computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking that at least two different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, due to the lack of central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or [[dial-up]] Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.

Another set of what could be termed social compatibility issues in the early days of grid computing related to the goals of grid developers to carry their innovation beyond the original field of high-performance computing and across disciplinary boundaries into new fields, like that of high-energy physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kertcher|first1=Zack|last2=Coslor|first2=Erica|date=2018-07-10|title=Boundary Objects and the Technical Culture Divide: Successful Practices for Voluntary Innovation Teams Crossing Scientific and Professional Fields|journal=Journal of Management Inquiry|volume=29|language=en|pages=76–91|doi=10.1177/1056492618783875|issn=1056-4926|hdl=11343/212143|s2cid=149911242|url=http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/212143/5/Kertcher%20%26%20Coslor%20-%20Boundary%20Objects%20and%20the%20Technical%20Culture%20Divide%202018-02-13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

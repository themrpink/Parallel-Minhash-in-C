Following the success of the LM-1, [[Oberheim]] introduced the [[Oberheim DMX|DMX]], which also featured digitally sampled sounds and a &quot;swing&quot; feature similar to the one found on the Linn machines. It became very popular in its own right, becoming a staple of the nascent hip-hop scene.

Other manufacturers soon began to produce machines, e.g. the [[Sequential Circuits]] Drum-Traks and Tom, the [[E-mu Drumulator]] and the [[Yamaha]] RX11.

In 1986, the [[SpecDrum]] by [[Cheetah Marketing]], an inexpensive 8-bit sampling drum external module for the [[ZX Spectrum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Roland TR-808 drum machine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Roland TR-808]] Rhythm Composer (1980)]]

In 1980, the [[Roland Corporation]] launched the TR-808 Rhythm Composer. It was one of the earliest [[Programming (music)|programmable]] drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns. Unlike the more expensive LM-1, the 808 is completely [[Analog synthesizer|analog]], meaning its sounds are generated non-digitally via hardware rather than [[Sampling (music)|samples]] (prerecorded sounds).&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandus.com/blog/2014/02/13/tr-808/|title=TR-808 drum machine flashback – Roland U.S. blog|last=Valle|first=OV|date=13 February 2014|website=rolandus.com|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:122&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2016/12/_808_the_movie_is_a_must_watch_doc_for_music_nerds.html|title=808s and heart eyes|last=Hamilton|first=Jack|date=16 December 2016|newspaper=Slate|access-date=16 January 2017|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/01/16/roland-tr-808-beginners-guide-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-introduction/|title=Everything you ever wanted to know about the Roland TR-808 but were afraid to ask|date=16 January 2014|website=Fact|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having built approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its [[Semiconductor device|semiconductors]] became impossible to restock.&lt;ref name=&quot;:83&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-808-heard-round-the-world|title=The 808 heard round the world|last=Norris|first=Chris|date=13 August 2015|journal=The New Yorker|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a [[cult following]] among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market,&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;/&gt; ease of use,&lt;ref name=&quot;:122&quot;/&gt; and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, &quot;booming&quot; [[bass drum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:83&quot;/&gt; It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, [[Dance music (popular)|dance]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] genres, popularized by early hits such as [[Marvin Gaye]]'s &quot;[[Sexual Healing]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:83&quot;/&gt; and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and the [[Soulsonic Force]]'s &quot;[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/14/roland-launch-new-instruments-808-909-303|title=Roland launch new versions of the iconic 808, 909 and 303 instruments|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=14 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 January 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=Peter|title=A Beginner's Guide to Digital Video|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stvOCfhc_igC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2004|page=18|publisher=AVA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-037-6|access-date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the [[Fender Stratocaster]]'s influence on [[Rock music|rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/roland-resurrects-808/|title=Early hip-hop's greatest drum machine just got resurrected|last=Baldwin|first=Roberto|date=14 February 2014|newspaper=Wired|access-date=4 January 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2008/12/whats_an_808.html|title=What's an 808?|last=Richards|first=Chris|date=2 December 2008|newspaper=Slate|access-date=16 January 2016|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sounds continue to be used as samples included with music software and modern drum machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.factmag.com/2018/01/25/roland-cloud-tr-808-tr-909-vst/|title=Roland is releasing official software versions of its 808 and 909 drum machines|last=Wilson|first=Scott|date=25 January 2018|work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|FACT Magazine]]|access-date=21 March 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alesis SR-16, Devi Ever OK.jpg|thumb|[[Alesis]] SR-16 (1991)]]

By 2000, standalone drum machines had become less common, partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and sampling and the use of loops, and [[music workstation]]s with integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However, traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation (under the name [[Boss Corporation|Boss]]), [[Zoom Corporation|Zoom]], [[Korg]] and [[Alesis]], whose SR-16 drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991.

There are percussion-specific [[sound module]]s that can be triggered by pickups, [[trigger pad]]s, or through MIDI. These are called [[Electronic drum|drum modules]]; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.

[[File:Korg Volca Beats 7928.jpg|thumb|right|A Korg Volca Beats analogue drum machine]]
In the 2010s a revival of interest in analogue synthesis resulted in a new wave of analogue drum machines, ranging from the budget-priced Korg Volca Beats and Akai Rhythm Wolf&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/korg-volca-beats-bass-keys Sound on Sound: Korg Volca Beats, Bass &amp; Keys, October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; to the mid-priced Arturia DrumBrute,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/arturia-drumbrute Sound on Sound: Arturia DrumBrute, December 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and the high-end MFB Tanzbär and [[Sequential (company)|Dave Smith Instruments]] Tempest. Roland's TR-08 and TR-09 Rhythm Composers were digital recreations of the original TR-808 and -909, while Behringer released an analogue clone of the 808 as the Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/behringer-rd-8-rhythm-designer Sound on Sound: Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer, January 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{See also|Music sequencer}}
[[File:Four to the floor Roland TR-707.jpg|thumb|[[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] on [[Roland TR-707]]]]

Programming of drum machines varies from product to product.  On most products, it can be done in '''real time''': the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a [[drum kit]] were being played; or using '''step-sequencing''': the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic [[Four on the floor (music)|4-on-the-floor]] dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain [[Fill (music)|fills]], [[Breakdown (music)|break-downs]] and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with '''song-sequence''' — essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen. The machine will [[Quantization (music)|quantize]] entries that are slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.

If the drum machine has [[MIDI]] connectivity, then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.

==Comparison with live drumming==
While drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s, &quot;...scientific studies show there are certain aspects of human-created rhythm that machines cannot replicate, or can only replicate poorly&quot; such as the &quot;feel&quot; of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music.mic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/113504/science-shows-why-drum-machines-will-never-replace-live-drummers |title=Science shows why drum machines will never replace live drummers|last1= Barnes|first1=Tom |date=23 March 2015 |website=mic.com |publisher=Music.mic |access-date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing, such as playing &quot;ahead of the beat&quot; or &quot;behind the beat&quot; for sections of a song, in contrast to a drum machine that plays a pre-programmed rhythm. As well, human drummers play a &quot;tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations&quot; that drum machines cannot reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music.mic&quot;/&gt;

==Labor costs==
Drum machines developed out of a need to create drum beats when a drum kit was not available. Increasingly, drum machines and drum programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Description ==

=== Codicology ===
The [[codicology]], or physical characteristics of the manuscript, has been studied by researchers. The manuscript measures {{convert|23.5| by |16.2| by |5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with hundreds of [[vellum parchment|vellum]] pages collected into 18 [[Paper quire|quires]]. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shailor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each [[recto and verso|recto]] (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's [[wikt:bifolio|bifolios]] were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.&lt;ref name=analysis&gt;{{harvnb|Barabe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelling&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pelling|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parchment, covers, and binding ===
[[Radiocarbon dating]] of samples from various parts of the manuscript was performed at the [[University of Arizona]] in 2009. The results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between 1404 and 1438.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_origin /&gt; Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calf skin, and multispectral analysis showed that it was unwritten on before the manuscript was created. The parchment was created with care, but deficiencies exist and the quality is assessed as average, at best.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_origin&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=The origin of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/origin.html#n04 |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parchment is prepared from &quot;at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EamonDuffy&quot;/&gt;

Some folios are thicker than the usual parchment thickness, such as folios 42 and 47.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_carbon&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=The Radio-Carbon Dating of the Voynich MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/extra/carbon.html |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goat skin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=About the binding of the MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/descr.html#cover |website=Voynich.nu |date=May 27, 2016 |access-date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; binding and covers are not original to the book, but date to its possession by the [[Collegio Romano]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt; Insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers, and discolouring on the edges points to a tanned-leather inside cover.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_origin /&gt;

=== Ink ===
Many pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are colored with paint. Based on modern analysis using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM), it has been determined that a [[quill]] pen and [[iron gall ink]] were used for the text and figure outlines. The ink of the drawings, text and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics. [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) performed in 2009 revealed that the inks contained major amounts of carbon, iron, [[sulfur]], [[potassium]], and calcium and [[trace element|trace amounts]] of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while [[X-ray diffraction]] (XRD) identified potassium [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|lead oxide]], potassium hydrogen sulphate and [[syngenite]] in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin.&lt;ref name=analysis /&gt;

=== Paint ===
Colored paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the ink outlined figures, possibly at a later date. The blue, white, red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analyzed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM). The blue paint proved to be ground [[azurite]] with minor traces of the copper oxide [[cuprite]]. The white paint is likely a mixture of eggwhite and [[calcium carbonate]], while the green paint is tentatively characterized by copper and copper-[[chlorine]] resinate; the crystalline material might be [[atacamite]] or another copper-chlorine compound. Analysis of the red-brown paint indicated a red [[ochre]] with the crystal phases [[hematite]] and iron sulfide. Minor amounts of lead sulfide and [[palmierite]] were possibly present in the red-brown paint.&lt;ref name=analysis /&gt; The pigments were considered inexpensive.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_origin /&gt;

=== Retouching ===
Computer scientist [[Jorge Stolfi]] of the [[University of Campinas]] highlighted that parts of the text and drawings are modified, using darker ink over a fainter earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example ''f1r'', ''f3v'', ''f26v'', ''f57v'', ''f67r2'', ''f71r'', ''f72v1'', ''f72v3'' and ''f73r''.&lt;ref name=Stolfi&gt;{{cite web |author=Stolfi, Jorge |date=July 22, 2004 |title=Evidence of text retouching of f1r |url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/voynich/04-07-15-retouching/ |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Text ===
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (119).jpg|thumb|200px|Page 119; ''f66r'', showing characteristics of the text]]
[[File:Voynich manuscript recipe example 107r crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Page 191; ''f107r'', text detail]]
Every page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in [[Latin script]]. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. Some dispute exists as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20–25 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious [[punctuation]].&lt;ref name=nsa /&gt;

Much of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt; Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations. There are no indications of any errors or corrections made at any place in the document. The [[wikt:ductus|ductus]] flows smoothly, giving the impression that the symbols were not [[cipher|enciphered]]; there is no delay between characters, as would normally be expected in written encoded text.

==== Extraneous writing ====
Only a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script:&lt;ref name=enigma /&gt;
* ''f1r'': A sequence of Latin letters in the right margin parallel with characters from the unknown script, also the now unreadable signature of &quot;[[Jacobus Sinapius|Jacobj à Tepenece]]&quot; is found in the bottom margin.
* ''f17r'': A line of writing in the Latin script in the top margin.
* ''f70v–f73v'': The astrological series of diagrams in the astronomical section has the names of 10 of the months (from March to December) written in Latin script, with spelling suggestive of the medieval languages of France, northwest Italy, or the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/voynich/months |author=Palmer, Sean B. |year=2004 |title=Voynich Manuscript: Months |website=Inamidst.com |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''f66r'': A small number of words in the bottom left corner near a drawing of a nude man have been read as &quot;''der Mussteil''&quot;, a High German&lt;ref name=enigma /&gt; phrase for &quot;a widow's share&quot;.
* ''f116v'': Four lines written in rather distorted Latin script, except for two words in the unknown script. The words in Latin script appear to be distorted with characteristics of the unknown language. The lettering resembles European alphabets of the late 14th and 15th centuries, but the words do not seem to make sense in any language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/voynich/michitonese |author=Palmer, Sean B. |title=Notes on f116v's Michitonese |website=Inamidst.com |year=2004 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether these bits of Latin script were part of the original text or were added later is not known.

==== Transcription ====
Various transcription alphabets have been created to equate the Voynich characters with Latin characters to help with cryptanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Extensible (originally: European) Voynich Alphabet (EVA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text: Eva |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html#Eva |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major one was created by the &quot;First Study Group&quot; led by cryptographer [[William F. Friedman]] in the 1940s, where each line of the manuscript was transcribed to an IBM [[punched card|punch card]] to make it [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Text Analysis – Transcription of the Text: FSG |url=http://www.voynich.nu/transcr.html#FSG |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reeds1994&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/mystere/wff.pdf |title=William F.

==== Statistical patterns ====
The text consists of over 170,000 characters,&lt;ref name=Schmeh /&gt; with spaces dividing the text into about 35,000 groups of varying length, usually referred to as &quot;words&quot; or &quot;word tokens&quot; (37,919); 8,114 of those words [[Hapax legomenon|are considered unique]] &quot;word types&quot;.&lt;ref name=ReddyKnight_p2&gt;{{harvnb|Reddy|Knight|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of these words seems to follow [[phonological]] or [[orthography|orthographic]] laws of some sort; for example, certain characters must appear in each word (like English [[vowel]]s), some characters never follow others, or some may be doubled or tripled, but others may not. The distribution of letters within words is also rather peculiar: Some characters occur only at the beginning of a word, some only at the end, and some always in the middle section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Analysis Section ( 2/5 ) – Character statistics |url=http://www.voynich.nu/a2_char.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have commented upon the highly regular structure of the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Analysis Section ( 3/5 ) – Word structure |date=December 26, 2015 |url=http://www.voynich.nu/a3_para.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert in ancient languages at [[Pennsylvania State University]], stated: {{quote|The things we know as 'grammatical markers' – things that occur commonly at the beginning or end of words, such as 's' or 'd' in our language, and that are used to express grammar, never appear in the middle of 'words' in the Voynich manuscript. That's unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian or Finnish language.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web| author=Day, Michael |date=May 24, 2011 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: will we ever be able to read this book? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8532458/The-Voynich-Manuscript-will-we-ever-be-able-to-read-this-book.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephan Vonfelt studied statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties which can be vaguely characterized as rhythmic resonance, alliteration or assonance) and found that under that respect Voynichese is more similar to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] [[pinyin]] text of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' than to the text of works from European languages, although the numerical differences between Voynichese and Mandarin Chinese pinyin look larger than those between Mandarin Chinese pinyin and European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Voynich_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928122339/http://graphometrie.free.fr/publications/Voynich_en.pdf|archive-date=28 September 2018|author=Vonfelt S.|date=2014|title=The strange resonances of the Voynich manuscript|website=[[Free (ISP)]] Graphométrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2019|reason=Has anyone else done a similar analysis and reached a similar result?}}

Practically no words have fewer than two letters or more than ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmeh&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_voynich_manuscript_the_book_nobody_can_read |title=The Voynich Manuscript: The Book Nobody Can Read |author=Schmeh, Klaus |date=January–February 2011 |website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words occur in only certain sections, or in only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. Few repetitions occur among the thousand or so labels attached to the illustrations. There are instances where the same common word appears up to three times in a row&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmeh&quot; /&gt; (see ''[[Zipf's law]]''). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherings to yield babble-like text. In 1962, [[cryptanalyst]] [[Elizebeth Friedman]] described such statistical analyses as &quot;doomed to utter frustration&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de//dokumente/b/b043178.pdf |author=Friedman, Elizebeth |date=August 5, 1962 |title=The Most Mysterious MS. – Still an Enigma |website=Washington D.C. Post |volume=E1, E5}} – Quoted in Mary D'Imperio's &quot;Elegant Enigma&quot;, p. 27 (section 4.4)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustrations ===

The illustrations are conventionally used to divide most of the manuscript into six different sections, since the text itself cannot be read. Each section is typified by illustrations with different styles and supposed subject matter&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmeh&quot; /&gt; except for the last section, in which the only drawings are small stars in the margin. The following are the sections and their conventional names:
* '''Herbal, 112 folios:''' Each page displays one or two plants and a few paragraphs of text, a format typical of European [[herbal]]s of the time. Some parts of these drawings are larger and cleaner copies of sketches seen in the &quot;pharmaceutical&quot; section. None of the plants depicted are unambiguously identifiable.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB&gt;{{cite web |author=Schwerdtfeger, Elias |year=2004 |title=Voynich Information Browser |url=http://voynich.freie-literatur.de/index.php?show=overview |access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Astronomical, 21 folios:''' Contains circular diagrams suggestive of [[astronomy]] or [[astrology]], some of them with suns, moons, and stars. One series of 12 diagrams depicts conventional symbols for the [[zodiac]]al constellations (two fish for [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], a bull for [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], a hunter with crossbow for [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], etc.). Each of these has 30 female figures arranged in two or more concentric bands. Most of the females are at least partly nude, and each holds what appears to be a labeled star or is shown with the star attached to either arm by what could be a tether or cord of some kind. The last two pages of this section were lost ([[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] and [[Capricornus]], roughly January and February), while [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and Taurus are split into four paired diagrams with 15 women and 15 stars each. Some of these diagrams are on fold-out pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;
* '''Balneological, 20 folios:''' A dense continuous text interspersed with figures, mostly showing small nude women, some wearing crowns, bathing in pools or tubs connected by an elaborate network of pipes. The bifolio consists of folios 78 (verso) and 81 (recto); it forms an integrated design, with water flowing from one folio to the other.&lt;ref name=voynich.nu_origin /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;
* '''Cosmological, 13 folios:''' More circular diagrams, but they are of an obscure nature. This section also has foldouts; one of them spans six pages, commonly called the Rosettes folio, and contains a map or diagram with nine &quot;islands&quot; or &quot;rosettes&quot; connected by &quot;[[causeway]]s&quot; and containing castles, as well as what might be a volcano.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;&lt;ref name=ZandbergenRosettes&gt;{{cite web|author=Zandbergen, René |date=May 17, 2016 |title=Rosettes folio |url=http://www.voynich.nu/q14/index.html#fRos |access-date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pharmaceutical, 34 folios:''' Many labeled drawings of isolated plant parts (roots, leaves, etc.), objects resembling [[apothecary]] jars, ranging in style from the mundane to the fantastical, and a few text paragraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;
* '''Recipes, 22 folios:''' Full pages of text broken into many short paragraphs, each marked with a star in the left margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS 408&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;

Five folios contain only text, and at least 28 folios are missing from the manuscript.&lt;ref name=VIB /&gt;

=== Purpose ===
[[File:Voynich Manuscript (66).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Page 66, ''f33v'', has been interpreted to represent a sunflower]]
The overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript is that it was meant to serve as a [[pharmacopoeia]] or to address topics in [[Medieval medicine|medieval or early modern medicine]]. However, the puzzling details of illustrations have fueled many theories about the book's origin, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmeh&quot; /&gt;

The first section of the book is almost certainly [[herbal]], but attempts have failed to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylized drawings of contemporaneous herbals.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyChurchill2011&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2011|pp=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, such as a [[Viola tricolor|wild pansy]] and the [[maidenhair fern]]. The herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them, except that missing parts were completed with improbable-looking details. In fact, many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyChurchill2011&quot; /&gt;

The basins and tubes in the balneological section are sometimes interpreted as implying a connection to [[alchemy]], yet they bear little obvious resemblance to the alchemical equipment of the period.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Astrological considerations frequently played a prominent role in herb gathering, [[bloodletting]], and other medical procedures common during the likeliest dates of the manuscript. However, interpretation remains speculative, apart from the obvious [[Zodiac]] symbols and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmeh&quot; /&gt;

It has been suggested that McCrone Associates found that much of the ink was added not long after the creation of the parchment, but the official report contains no statement to this effect.&lt;ref name=analysis /&gt;

The first confirmed owner was [[Georg Baresch]], a 17th Century [[alchemy|alchemist]] from [[Prague]]. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this &quot;[[Sphinx|Sphynx]]&quot; that had been &quot;taking up space uselessly in his library&quot; for many years.&lt;ref name=ZandbergenLetters /&gt; He learned that [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] from the [[Collegio Romano]] had published a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ([[Egyptology|Egyptian]]) dictionary and [[Oedipus Aegyptiacus|claimed to have deciphered]] the [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. His 1639 letter to Kircher is the earliest confirmed mention of the manuscript that has been found to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuster2009&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schuster|2009|pp=175–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some members of the [[Rastafari movement]] (which was founded in Jamaica in the 1930s and whose followers are now estimated to number between 700,000 and one million) Haile Selassie is referred to as the returned [[messiah]] of the Bible, God [[incarnation|incarnate]]. This distinction notwithstanding, Haile Selassie was a Christian and adhered to the tenets and liturgy of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Rastafarian|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Rastafarianism|work=Major religions ranked by size|publisher=Adherents}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Leonard E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swdaI6DfDkEC&amp;pg=PA118|title=The Rastafarians|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8070-1039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has been criticized by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (the ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|mesafint]]''), which consistently opposed his reforms; some critics have also criticized Ethiopia's failure to modernize rapidly enough.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Martin (2005), ''The Fate of Africa: From the Hopes of Freedom to the Heart of Despair''.

Haile Selassie was known as a child as '''Lij Tafari Makonnen''' (Amharic: {{lang|gez|ልጅ ተፈሪ መኮንን}}; ''Lij Teferī Mekōnnin''). ''[[Lij (title)|Lij]]'' is translated as &quot;child&quot; and serves to indicate that a youth is of noble blood. His given name, ''Tafari'', means &quot;one who is respected or feared.&quot; Like most Ethiopians, his personal name &quot;Tafari&quot; is followed by that of his father [[Makonnen Wolde Mikael|Makonnen]] and that of his grandfather Woldemikael.  His [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] name Haile Selassie was given to him at his infant baptism and adopted again as part of his [[regnal name]] in 1930.

As Governor of Harar, he became known as [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Tafari Makonnen {{audio|Ras Teferi Mekonnen.ogg|listen}}. ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Ras]]'' is translated as &quot;head&quot;&lt;ref name= babylon172&gt;{{Harvnb |Murrell | pp = 172–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a rank of nobility equivalent to [[Duke]];{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. xiii}} though it is often rendered in translation as &quot;prince&quot;. In 1916, [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Empress]] [[Zewditu I]] appointed him to the position of ''Balemulu Silt'an [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Enderase]]'' ([[Regent]] Plenipotentiary). In 1928, she planned on granting him the throne of Shewa, however at the last moment opposition from certain provincial rulers caused a change and his title ''[[Negus]]'' or &quot;King&quot; was conferred without geographical qualification or definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steffanson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steffanson |first1=Borg G. |last2=Starret |first2=Ronald K. |title=Documents on Ethiopian Politics Vol. II |date=1976 |publisher=Documentary Publications |location=North Carolina, U.S.A. |isbn=0897120086 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;africamediaonline.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Haile Selasie: 40 year anniversary of his death |url = http://www.africamediaonline.com/mmc/gallery/detail/african_calendar/haile-selasie:-120th-aniversary-of-his-birth |website= African calendar | publisher = Africa Media Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Lij Teferi and his father, Ras Makonnen.jpg|thumb|upright|''Ras'' Makonnen Woldemikael and his son ''Lij'' Tafari Makonnen|alt=|left]]
Haile Selassie's royal line (through his father's mother) descended from the Shewan [[Amhara people|Amhara]] Solomonic King, [[Sahle Selassie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pétridès |first1=S. Pierre |title=Le Héros d'Adoua: Ras Makonnen, Prince d'Éthiopie |date=1963 |publisher=Librairie Plon |location=8, rue Garancière, Paris |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 23 July 1892, in the village of [[Ejersa Goro]], in the [[Harar]] province of Ethiopia. His mother was Woizero (&quot;Lady&quot;) [[Yeshimebet Ali]] Abba Jifar, daughter of a ruling chief from [[Were Ilu (woreda)|Wore Ilu]] in [[Wollo]] province, [[Dejazmach]] Ali Abba Jifar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moor&quot;&gt;de Moor, Jaap, and Wesseling, H. L. (1989), ''Imperialism and War: Essays on Colonial Wars in Asia and Africa''. Brill. {{ISBN|9004088342}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother was of [[Gurage people|Gurage]] heritage but [[Oromo_people|Oromo]] Ethincity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward&quot;&gt;Woodward, Peter (1994), ''Conflict and Peace in the Horn of Africa: federalism and its alternatives''. Dartmouth Pub. Co. {{ISBN|1-85521486-5}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Tafari's father was [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Makonnen Wolde Mikael]], the grandson of King Sahle Selassie and governor of Harar. Ras Makonnen thus was maternally [[Amhara_people|Amhara]] but paternally [[Oromo_people |Oromo]]&lt;ref&gt;Haile Selassie I Biography
(1892–1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a general in the [[First Italo–Ethiopian War]], playing a key role at the [[Battle of Adwa]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Moor&quot;/&gt; Haile Selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother, Woizero Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor [[Menelik II]] and daughter of the Solomonic Amhara King of Shewa, Negus [[Sahle Selassie]]. As such, Haile Selassie claimed direct descent from [[Makeda]], the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 265}}

Ras Makonnen arranged for Tafari as well as his first cousin, [[Imru Haile Selassie]], to receive instruction in Harar from [[Abba Samuel Wolde Kahin]], an Ethiopian [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|capuchin monk]], and from Dr. Vitalien, a surgeon from [[Guadeloupe]]. Tafari was named [[Dejazmach]] (literally &quot;commander of the gate&quot;, roughly equivalent to &quot;[[count]]&quot;){{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. xii}} at the age of 13, on 1 November 1905.&lt;ref name= so193 /&gt; Shortly thereafter, his father Ras Makonnen died at [[Kulibi]], in 1906.&lt;ref name=rad712&gt;{{Harvnb |Roberts | p = 712}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governorship===
&lt;!--NOTE: Several sources state that Tafari assumed Harar's governorship in 1906, but this is incorrect and contradicted by better and more numerous sources.--&gt;
[[File:Tafari Dejazmatch Harrar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Dejazmatch '' Tafari, as governor of Harar]]
Tafari assumed the titular governorship of Selale in 1906, a realm of marginal importance,&lt;ref name= jah&gt;{{Harvnb |White | pp = 34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but one that enabled him to continue his studies.&lt;ref name= so193 /&gt;  In 1907, he was appointed governor over part of the province of [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. It is alleged that during his late teens, Haile Selassie was married to ''Woizero'' Altayech, and that from this union, his daughter [[Princess Romanework]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solomoniccrownheraldry.org/history_of_ethiopia_monarchy_modern_era_part_seven.htm |title= Modern era |work= History of Ethiopia |publisher= Solomonic crown heraldry |accessdate= 12 September 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926152149/http://www.solomoniccrownheraldry.org/history_of_ethiopia_monarchy_modern_era_part_seven.htm |archivedate= 26 September 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his brother Yelma in 1907, the governorate of Harar was left vacant,&lt;ref name=jah /&gt; and its administration was left to Menelik's loyal general, ''Dejazmach'' [[Balcha Safo]]. Balcha Safo's administration of Harar was ineffective, and so during the last illness of Menelik II, and the brief reign of Empress [[Taitu Bitul]], Tafari was made governor of Harar in 1910&lt;ref name=rad712 /&gt; or 1911.&lt;ref name=m387&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 1911, he married [[Menen Asfaw]] of [[Ambassel]], niece of the heir to the throne [[Lij Iyasu]].

===Regency===
The extent to which Tafari Makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose [[Lij Iyasu]] has been discussed extensively, particularly in Haile Selassie's own detailed account of the matter. Iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. Iyasu's reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather, Menelik II,&lt;ref&gt;Lentakis, Michael B. (2004), ''Ethiopia: Land of the Lotus Eaters''. Janus Pub. Co. {{ISBN|1-85756558-4}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; damaged his reputation. Iyasu's flirtation with Islam was considered treasonous among the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christian]] leadership of the empire. On 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed.&lt;ref name=so228 /&gt;
[[File:Zewditu and favored priest.png|upright|thumb|Empress Zewditu with one of her trusted priests]]
[[File:Tafari Thesiger 1917.jpg|thumb|Ras Tafari at his investiture as regent on 11 February 1917]]
Contributing to the movement that deposed Iyasu were conservatives such as ''[[Fitawrari]]'' [[Habte Giyorgis]], Menelik II's longtime Minister of War. The movement to depose Iyasu preferred Tafari, as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions.  Ultimately, Iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name= babylon172 /&gt;&lt;ref name= so228&gt;{{Harvnb |Shinn | p = 228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his place, the daughter of Menelik II (the aunt of Iyasu) was named Empress [[Zewditu]], while Tafari was elevated to the rank of ''Ras'' and was made [[heir apparent]] and [[Crown Prince]]. In the power arrangement that followed, Tafari accepted the role of [[Plenipotentiary|Regent Plenipotentiary]] (''Balemulu 'Inderase'')&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''Bālemulu'' literally means &quot;fully empowered&quot; or &quot;wholly authorised,&quot; thus distinguishing it from the general use of ''Enderase'', that being a representative or lieutenant of the Emperor to fiefs or vassals, essentially a [[Governor-General]] or [[Viceroy]], by which term provincial governors in the contemporary Imperial period, during Haile Selassie's reign, were referred.{{Citation needed |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (''Mangista Ityop'p'ya''). Zewditu would govern while Tafari would administer.{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 126}}
While Iyasu had been deposed on 27 September 1916, on 8 October he managed to escape into the [[Ogaden Desert]] and his father, ''Negus'' [[Mikael of Wollo]], had time to come to his aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus, page 127&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Marcus | p = 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 October, ''Negus'' Mikael and his army met an army under ''Fitawrari'' Habte Giyorgis loyal to Zewditu and Tafari. During the [[Battle of Segale]], ''Negus'' Mikael was defeated and captured. Any chance that Iyasu would regain the throne was ended, and he went into hiding. On 11 January 1921, after avoiding capture for about five years, Iyasu was taken into custody by [[Gugsa Araya Selassie]].

On 11 February 1917, the coronation for Zewditu took place. She pledged to rule justly through her Regent, Tafari. While Tafari was the more visible of the two, Zewditu was far from an honorary ruler. Her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions. In other words, she had the last word. Tafari carried the burden of daily administration, but, because his position was relatively weak, this was often an exercise in futility.  Initially his personal army was poorly equipped, his finances were limited, and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the Empress, the Minister of War, or the provincial governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus, page 127&quot; /&gt;

During his Regency, the new Crown Prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by Menelik II. Also, during this time, he survived the [[1918 flu pandemic]], having come down with the illness.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Harold (1996), ''Haile Selassie I: The formative years, 1892–1936''. Trenton: Red Sea Press. {{ISBN|1-56902007-8}}, pp. 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He secured Ethiopia's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1923 by promising to eradicate slavery; each emperor since [[Tewodros II]] had issued proclamations to halt [[slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith, W.

====Travel abroad====
In 1924, ''Ras'' Tafari toured Europe and the Middle East visiting [[Jerusalem]], [[Alexandria]], Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], Stockholm, London, [[Geneva]], and [[Athens]]. With him on his tour was a group that included ''Ras'' [[Seyum Mangasha]] of western [[Tigray Province]]; ''Ras'' [[Hailu Tekle Haymanot]] of [[Gojjam]] province; ''Ras'' [[Mulugeta Yeggazu]] of [[Illubabor Province]]; ''Ras'' [[Makonnen Endelkachew]]; and ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Blattengeta]]'' [[Blattengeta Heruy Welde Sellase|Heruy Welde Sellase]].  The primary goal of the trip to Europe was for Ethiopia to gain access to the sea. In Paris, Tafari was to find out from the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] (''[[Quai d'Orsay]]'') that this goal would not be realized.{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 123}} However, failing this, he and his retinue inspected schools, hospitals, factories, and churches. Although patterning many reforms after European models, Tafari remained wary of European pressure. To guard against [[economic imperialism]], Tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Appiah, ''Africana'' (1999), p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; Of his modernization campaign, he remarked, &quot;We need European progress only because we are surrounded by it. That is at once a benefit and a misfortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Joel Augustus (1936). ''The Real Facts about Ethiopia'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Tafari's travels in Europe, the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination. Seyum Mangasha accompanied him and Hailu Tekle Haymanot who, like Tafari, were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against Italy a quarter-century earlier at the [[Battle of Adwa]].&lt;ref name=mockler&gt;{{Harvnb |Mockler | pp = 3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of his entourage, Mulugeta Yeggazu, actually fought at Adwa as a young man.

The crown had been taken by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Sir Robert Napier]] during the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mockler|Mockler]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, the Crown Prince visited the Armenian monastery of [[Jerusalem]]. There, he adopted 40 [[Armenians|Armenian]] orphans (አርባ ልጆች ''[[Arba Lijoch]]'', &quot;forty children&quot;), who had lost their parents in Ottoman massacres. Tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths, and they came to form the imperial brass band.&lt;ref&gt;Nidel, Richard (2005), ''World Music: The Basics''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415968003}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===King and Emperor===
{{see also|Modernization under Haile Selassie}}
Tafari's authority was challenged in 1928 when ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Dejazmach]]'' [[Balcha Safo]] went to Addis Ababa with a sizeable armed force. When Tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces, many of Menelik's appointees refused to abide by the new regulations. Balcha Safo, the governor (''Shum'') of coffee-rich [[Sidamo Province]], was particularly troublesome. The revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and Tafari recalled him to Addis Ababa. The old man came in high dudgeon and, insultingly, with a large army.{{refn |Balcha Safo brought an army of ten thousand with him from Sidamo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus, page 127&quot;/&gt; |group= nb}} The ''Dejazmatch'' paid homage to Empress Zewditu, but snubbed Tafari.&lt;ref name= cambridge&gt;{{Harvnb |Roberts | p = 723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Marcus | p = 129}} On 18 February, while Balcha Safo and his personal bodyguard{{refn |Balcha Safo's personal bodyguard numbered about five hundred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus, page 127&quot; /&gt;|group=nb}} were in Addis Ababa, Tafari had ''Ras'' [[Kassa Haile Darge]] buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the ''Shum'' of Sidamo Province{{Sfn |Mockler | p = 8}} by Birru Wolde Gabriel who himself was replaced by [[Desta Damtew]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus, page 127&quot; /&gt;

Even so, the gesture of Balcha Safo empowered Empress Zewditu politically and she attempted to have Tafari tried for [[treason]]. He was tried for his benevolent dealings with Italy including a [[Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928|20-year peace accord]] which was signed on 2 August.&lt;ref name= so193&gt;{{Harvnb |Shinn | pp = 193–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress, made a [[1928 Ethiopian coup d'état|final bid to get rid of Tafari]]. The attempted ''coup d'état'' was tragic in its origins and comic in its end. When confronted by Tafari and a company of his troops, the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in Menelik's mausoleum. Tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of Zewditu. More of Tafari's khaki clad soldiers arrived and decided the outcome in his favor with superiority of arms.{{Sfn |Marcus | pp = 127–28}} Popular support, as well as the support of the police,&lt;ref name= cambridge /&gt; remained with Tafari. Ultimately, the Empress relented and, on 7 October 1928, she crowned Tafari as ''[[Negus]]'' ([[Amharic]]: &quot;King&quot;).

The crowning of Tafari as King was controversial. He occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire. Two monarchs, even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor (in this case empress), had never occupied the same location as their seat in [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopian history]]. Conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the crown's dignity, leading to the [[Gugsa Wale's rebellion|rebellion of ''Ras'' Gugsa Welle]]. [[Gugsa Welle]] was the husband of the empress and the ''Shum'' of [[Begemder]] Province. In early 1930, he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at [[Gondar]] towards [[Addis Ababa]]. On 31 March 1930, Gugsa Welle was met by forces loyal to ''Negus'' Tafari and was defeated at the [[Battle of Anchem]]. Gugsa Welle was [[killed in action]].{{Sfn |Roberts | p = 724}} News of Gugsa Welle's defeat and death had hardly spread through Addis Ababa when the empress died suddenly on 2 April 1930.

With the passing of Zewditu, Tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed ''Neguse Negest ze-'Ityopp'ya'', &quot;King of Kings of Ethiopia&quot;. He was crowned on 2 November 1930, at [[St. George's Cathedral, Addis Ababa|Addis Ababa's Cathedral of St. George]]. The coronation was by all accounts &quot;a most splendid affair&quot;,&lt;ref name= m12&gt;{{Harvnb |Mockler | p = 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world. Among those in attendance were [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|The Duke of Gloucester]] (King [[George V]]'s son), [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]] of France, and the [[Prince Ferdinando, Duke of Genoa (1884–1963)|Prince of Udine]] representing King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].

In 1932, the [[Kingdom of Jimma|Sultanate of Jimma]] was formally absorbed into Ethiopia following the death of Sultan [[Abba Jifar II]] of [[Jimma]].

===Conflict with Italy===
{{See also|Abyssinia Crisis|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}
Ethiopia became the target of renewed Italian imperialist designs in the 1930s. [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist]] regime was keen to avenge the military defeats Italy had suffered to Ethiopia in the [[First Italo-Abyssinian War]], and to efface the failed attempt by &quot;liberal&quot; Italy to conquer the country, as epitomised by the defeat at [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]].{{Sfn |Mockler | p = 61}}&lt;ref name=carlton&gt;Carlton, Eric (1992), ''Occupation: The Policies and Practices of Military Conquerors''.

Ethiopia's position in the League of Nations did not dissuade the Italians from invading in 1935; the &quot;[[collective security]]&quot; envisaged by the League proved useless, and a scandal erupted when the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] revealed that Ethiopia's League allies were scheming to appease Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston (1986). ''The Second World War''. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mobilization====
Following 5 December 1934 Italian invasion of Ethiopia at Welwel, Ogaden Province, Haile Selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at [[Dessie|Desse]] in [[Wollo]] province. He issued his mobilization order on 3 October 1935:
{{Quote |If you withhold from your country Ethiopia the death from cough or head-cold of which you would otherwise die, refusing to resist (in your district, in your patrimony, and in your home) our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us, and if you persist in not shedding your blood, you will be rebuked for it by your Creator and will be cursed by your offspring. Hence, without cooling your heart of accustomed valour, there emerges your decision to fight fiercely, mindful of your history that will last far into the future…  If on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside, not even grass, straw, and dung excluded, it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… You, countryman, living at the various access routes, set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your district-governor will indicate to you, lest the soldiers campaigning for Ethiopia's liberty should experience difficulty. You will not be charged excise duty, until the end of the campaign, for anything you are marketing at the military camps: I have granted you remission… After you have been ordered to go to war, but are then idly missing from the campaign, and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser, you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land, your property, and your body; to the accuser I shall grant a third of your property…}}

On 19 October 1935, Haile Selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his Commander-in-Chief, Ras [[Kassa Haile Darge|Kassa]]:
{{Quote |
# When you set up tents, it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood, if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons. Tents are to be set up at a distance of 30 cubits from each other.
# When an aeroplane is sighted, one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes, along places which have trees and woods.
# When an aeroplane comes to drop bombs, it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about 100 metres; hence when it flies low for such action, one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse. When three or four bullets have hit it, the aeroplane is bound to fall down. But let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing, for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun, there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the men's whereabouts.
# Lest the aeroplane, when rising again, should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed, it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close. In time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields, ornaments, silver and gold cloaks, silk shirts, and similar things. Whether one possesses a jacket or not, it is best to wear a narrow-sleeved shirt with faded colours. When we return, with God's help, you can wear your gold and silver decorations then. Now it is time to go and fight. We offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution.  At the same time, We are glad to assure you that in time of war. We are ready to shed Our blood in your midst for the sake of Ethiopia's freedom…&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jah-rastafari.com/autobiography/show-jah-chapter.asp?word_chapter=35 |title=Chapter 35 – We proclaim mobilization |accessdate=2014-04-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611043703/http://www.jah-rastafari.com/autobiography/show-jah-chapter.asp?word_chapter=35 |archivedate=11 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }} in ''Words of RasTafarI, Haile Selassie I''.

Compared to the Ethiopians, the Italians had an advanced, modern military which included a large air force. The Italians would also come to employ [[chemical weapons]] extensively throughout the conflict, even targeting [[Red Cross]] field hospitals in violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudendistel, Rainer (2006), ''Between Bombs And Good Intentions: The Red Cross And the Italo-Ethiopian War''. Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|1-84545035-3}}, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progress of the war====
Starting in early October 1935, the [[De Bono's invasion of Abyssinia|Italians invaded Ethiopia]]. But, by November, the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and Haile Selassie's northern armies were able to launch what was known as the &quot;[[Ethiopian Christmas Offensive|Christmas Offensive]]&quot;. During this offensive, the Italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive.  In early 1936, the [[First Battle of Tembien]] stopped the progress of the Ethiopian offensive and the Italians were ready to continue their offensive. Following the defeat and destruction of the northern Ethiopian armies at the [[Battle of Amba Aradam]], the [[Second Battle of Tembien]], and the [[Battle of Shire]], Haile Selassie took the field with the last Ethiopian army on the northern front. On 31 March 1936, he launched a [[counterattack]] against the Italians himself at the [[Battle of Maychew]] in southern [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]. The emperor's army was defeated and retreated in disarray. As Haile Selassie's army withdrew, the Italians attacked from the air along with rebellious Raya and Azebo tribesmen on the ground, who were armed and paid by the Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John (1997), ''Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-52102606-7}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie made a solitary [[pilgrimage]] to the churches at [[Lalibela]], at considerable risk of capture, before returning to his capital.&lt;ref name= moc&gt;{{Harvnb |Mockler | p = 123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After a stormy session of the council of state, it was agreed that because [[Addis Ababa]] could not be defended, the government would relocate to the southern town of [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], and that in the interest of preserving the Imperial house, the emperor's wife [[Menen Asfaw]] and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for [[French Somaliland]], and from there continue on to [[Jerusalem]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

====Exile debate====
[[File:SelassieInJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor arrives in Jerusalem. May 1936]]
After further debate as to whether Haile Selassie should go to Gore or accompany his family into exile, it was agreed that he should leave Ethiopia with his family and present the case of Ethiopia to the [[League of Nations]] at [[Geneva]]. The decision was not unanimous and several participants, including the nobleman [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Blatta]] [[Tekle Wolde Hawariat]], strenuously objected to the idea of an Ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, John (2006). ''Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years''. Tsehai Publishers. {{ISBN|1-59907000-6}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Haile Selassie appointed his cousin Ras [[Imru Haile Selassie]] as Prince Regent in his absence, departing with his family for [[French Somaliland]] on 2 May 1936.

On 5 May, Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]] led Italian troops into Addis Ababa, and Mussolini declared Ethiopia an Italian province. [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel III]] was proclaimed as the new [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. On the previous day, the Ethiopian exiles had left French Somaliland aboard the British cruiser [[HMS Enterprise (D52)|HMS ''Enterprise'']]. They were bound for [[Jerusalem]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], where the Ethiopian royal family maintained a residence. The Imperial family disembarked at [[Haifa]] and then went on to Jerusalem. Once there, Haile Selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at Geneva. The choice of Jerusalem was highly symbolic, since the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] claimed descent from the [[Davidic line|House of David]]. Leaving the [[Holy Land]], Haile Selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the British cruiser [[HMS Capetown (D88)|HMS ''Capetown'']] for [[Gibraltar]], where he stayed at the [[Rock Hotel]]. From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the United Kingdom government was spared the expense of a state reception.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. J. (1936), ''The Rape of Ethiopia'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collective security and the League of Nations, 1936====
Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and promptly declared his own &quot;[[Italian Empire]]&quot;. After the League of Nations afforded Haile Selassie the opportunity to address the assembly, Italy withdrew its League delegation, on 12 May 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, John (2006). ''Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years''. Tsehai Publishers. {{ISBN|1-59907000-6}}. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this context that Haile Selassie walked into the hall of the League of Nations, introduced by the President of the Assembly as &quot;His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia&quot; (''Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie''). The introduction caused a great many Italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering, heckling, and whistling. As it turned out, they had earlier been issued whistles by Mussolini's son-in-law, Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]].&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Ray (1999), ''Mussolini's Shadow: The Double Life of Count Galeazzo Ciano''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-30007917-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian delegate, [[Nicolae Titulescu]], famously jumped to his feet in response and cried &quot;To the door with the savages!&quot;, and the offending journalists were removed from the hall. Haile Selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared, and responded &quot;majestically&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Jarrett-Macauley|Jarrett-Macauley, Delia]] (1998), ''The Life of Una Marson, 1905–65'', Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-71905284-X}}, pp. 102–3.&lt;/ref&gt; with a speech considered by some{{By whom |date=August 2016}} among the most stirring of the 20th century.{{Sfn | Safire | 1997 | pp = 297–8}}

Although fluent in French, the League's working language, Haile Selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native [[Amharic]]. He asserted that, because his &quot;confidence in the League was absolute&quot;, his people were now being slaughtered. He pointed out that the same European states that found in Ethiopia's favor at the League of Nations were refusing Ethiopia credit and [[matériel]] while aiding Italy, which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike.
{{Quote |It was at the time when the operations for the encircling of [[Mek'ele|Makale]] were taking place that the Italian command, fearing a rout, followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world. Special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize, over vast areas of territory, a fine, death-dealing rain. Groups of nine, fifteen, eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet. It was thus that, as from the end of January 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain.  In order to kill off systematically all living creatures, in order to more surely poison waters and pastures, the Italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again. That was its chief method of warfare.{{Sfn | Safire | 1997 | p = 318}}}}

Noting that his own &quot;small people of 12 million inhabitants, without arms, without resources&quot; could never withstand an attack by a large power such as Italy, with its 42&amp;nbsp;million people and &quot;unlimited quantities of the most death-dealing weapons&quot;, he contended that the aggression threatened all small states, and that all small states were in effect reduced to [[vassal state]]s in the absence of collective action. He admonished the League that &quot;God and history will remember your judgment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Ferraro | first = Vincent |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/selassie.htm |title=Haile Selassie, &quot;Appeal to the League of Nations&quot;, June 1936 |publisher=Mtholyoke |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote |It is collective security: it is the very existence of the League of Nations. It is the confidence that each State is to place in international treaties…  In a word, it is international morality that is at stake. Have the signatures appended to a Treaty value only in so far as the signatory Powers have a personal, direct and immediate interest involved?}}

The speech made the emperor an icon for anti-fascists around the world, and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19360106,00.html | newspaper = Time | type = magazine | title = Man of the Year | date = 6 January 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He failed, however, to get what he most needed: the League agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on Italy. Only six nations in 1937 did not recognize Italy's occupation: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name=carlton /&gt; It is often said the League of Nations effectively collapsed due to its failure to condemn Italy's invasion of Abyssinia.

Haile Selassie spent his exile years (1936–41) in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, in [[Fairfield House, Bath|Fairfield House]], which he bought. The emperor and [[Kassa Haile Darge]] took morning walks together behind the 14-room Victorian house's high walls. Haile Selassie's favorite reading was &quot;diplomatic history.&quot; But most of his serious hours were occupied with the 90,000-word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in Amharic.{{Sfn | ''Time'' | 1937}}

Haile Selassie's activity in this period was focused on countering Italian propaganda as to the state of Ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 11–2.}} He spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts (including the theft of a 1,600-year-old imperial obelisk), and condemned the atrocities suffered by the Ethiopian civilian population.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 26–27.}} He continued to plead for League intervention and to voice his certainty that &quot;God's judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike&quot;,&lt;ref name= progress25 /&gt; though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against Italy were largely unsuccessful until Italy entered World War II on the German side in June 1940.&lt;ref name= ofcan&gt;Ofcansky, Thomas P. and Berry, Laverle (2004), ''Ethiopia: A Country Study''. Kessinger Publishing.  {{ISBN|1-41911857-9}}, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor's pleas for international support did take root in the United States, particularly among African-American organizations sympathetic to the Ethiopian cause.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 27}} In 1937, Haile Selassie was to give a Christmas Day radio address to the American people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident, leaving him with a fractured knee.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}  Rather than canceling the radio broadcast, he delivered the address, in which he linked Christianity and goodwill with the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], and asserted that &quot;War is not the only means to stop war&quot;:{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}
{{Quote |
With the birth of the Son of God, an unprecedented, an unrepeatable, and a long-anticipated phenomenon occurred. He was born in a stable instead of a palace, in a manger instead of a crib. The hearts of the Wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to His Majestic Humbleness. The kings prostrated themselves before Him and worshipped Him. 'Peace be to those who have good will'. This became the first message.

...Although the toils of wise people may earn them respect, it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world. The arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction. The laws of the League of Nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place…  So that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom Christ redeemed with his blood, all peace-loving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, pp. 40–42}}}}

During this period, Haile Selassie suffered several personal tragedies. His two sons-in-law, Ras [[Desta Damtew]] and Dejazmach [[Beyene Merid]], were both executed by the Italians.&lt;ref name=progress25&gt;{{Harvnb | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor's daughter, Princess [[Romanework]], wife of Dejazmach Beyene Merid, was herself taken into captivity with her children, and she died in Italy in 1941.&lt;ref name=him170&gt;{{Harvnb | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in 1942.{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 3}}

British forces, which consisted primarily of Ethiopian-backed African and South African colonial troops under the &quot;[[Gideon Force]]&quot; of Colonel [[Orde Wingate]], coordinated the military effort to liberate Ethiopia. The emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period, demonstrating that, while authority was not divided up in any formal way, British military might and the emperor's populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate Ethiopia.&lt;ref name= ofcan /&gt;

On 18 January 1941, during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Haile Selassie crossed the border between [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] near the village of Um Iddla. The standard of the [[Lion of Judah]] was raised again. Two days later, he and a force of Ethiopian patriots joined [[Gideon Force]] which was already in Ethiopia and preparing the way.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. J. (1936), ''The Rape of Ethiopia'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was defeated by a force of the United Kingdom, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Free French Forces|Free France]], [[Free Belgian Forces|Free Belgium]], and Ethiopian patriots. On 5 May 1941, Haile Selassie entered [[Addis Ababa]] and personally addressed the Ethiopian people, five years to the day since his 1936 exile:
{{Quote |
Today is the day on which we defeated our enemy. Therefore, when we say let us rejoice with our hearts, let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of Christ. Do not return evil for evil. Do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way, even to the last.

Take care not to spoil the good name of Ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy. We shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came. As Saint George who killed the dragon is the Patron Saint of our army as well as of our allies, let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind.{{Sfn | Selassie | 1999 | loc = vol. 2, p. 165}}}}

On 27 August 1942, Haile Selassie confirmed the legal basis for the abolition of [[African slave trade|slavery]] that had been enacted by Italy throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties, including death, for slave trading.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter P.; McKivigan, John R. and Williams, R.

In 1948, the [[Ogaden]], a region disputed with both [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]], was granted to Ethiopia.{{Sfn |Shinn | p = 201}}  On 2 December 1950, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 390 (V), establishing the federation of [[Eritrea]] (the former Italian colony) into Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=shinn141&gt;[[#Shinn|Shinn]], pp. 140–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eritrea was to have its own constitution, which would provide for ethnic, linguistic, and cultural balance, while Ethiopia was to manage its finances, defense, and foreign policy.&lt;ref name=shinn141 /&gt;

Despite his centralization policies that had been made before World War II, Haile Selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programmes he wanted. In 1942, he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme, but this failed due to opposition from the nobility, and only a flat tax was passed; in 1951, he agreed to reduce this as well.&lt;ref name=eth&gt;Ofcansky, Thomas P. and Berry, Laverle (2004).

Africa World Press. {{ISBN|0865431515}}, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperor's attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy, which were eager to resume their privileges in the post-war era.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt; Where Haile Selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes, the burdens were often still passed by the landowners to the peasants.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt;

Between 1941 and 1959, Haile Selassie worked to establish the [[autocephaly]] of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].&lt;ref name=copts&gt;Watson, John H. (2000), ''Among the Copts''. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-902210-56-8}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been headed by the ''[[Abuna]]'', a bishop who answered to the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In 1942 and 1945, Haile Selassie applied to the [[Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]] to establish the independence of Ethiopian bishops, and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the Coptic Church of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=copts /&gt; Finally, in 1959, [[Pope Kyrillos VI]] elevated the ''Abuna'' to Patriarch-Catholicos.&lt;ref name=copts /&gt; The Ethiopian Church remained affiliated with the Alexandrian Church.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt; In addition to these efforts, Haile Selassie changed the Ethiopian church-state relationship by introducing taxation of church lands, and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy, who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses.&lt;ref name=eth /&gt;

In 1948, the [[Harari people|Harari]] Muslims of [[Harar]] peacefully protested against religious oppression; however, the state responded violently. Hundreds were arrested and the entire town of Harar was put under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shetler |first1=Jan |title=Building a &quot;City of Peace&quot; through Intercommunal Association Muslim-Christian Relations in Harar, Ethiopia, 1887-2009 |url=https://www.manchester.edu/docs/default-source/academics/by-major/philosophy-and-religious-studies/journal/volume-4-issue-1-fall-2010/building-a-city-of-peace-through-intercommunal-association.pdf?sfvrsn=62628962_2 |website=Manchester University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also took control of many assets and estates belonging to the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muehlenbeck |first1=Philip |title=Religion and the Cold War: A Global Perspective |publisher=Vanderbilt University Press |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytEC2bOstFUC&amp;q=kulub+harar&amp;pg=PA147|isbn=9780826518521 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ibrahim |first1=Abadir |title=The Role of Civil Society in Africa's Quest for Democratization |publisher=Springer |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GaCwDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=harar+under+house+arrest&amp;pg=PA134|isbn=9783319183831 |date=8 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a massive exodus of Hararis from the [[Harari Region]], which had not occurred in their history prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feener|first1=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsjuQaGLRUkC&amp;q=kulub+movement+harar&amp;pg=PA227|title=Islam in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576075166|page=227|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vaughan |first1=Sarah |title=Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia |publisher=The University of Edinburgh |page=235|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/id/1299/vaughanphd.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissatisfaction of the Harari stemmed from the fact that they had never received limited autonomy of Harar, which was promised by [[Menelik II]] after his conquest of the kingdom. The promise was eroded by successive [[Amhara people|Amhara]] governors. According to historian Tim Carmicheal, Haile Selassie was directly involved in the suppression of the Harari movement through his policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carmichael |first1=Tim |title=Political Culture in Ethiopia's Provincial Administration: Haile Sellassie, Blata Ayele Gebre and the (Hareri) Kulub Movement of 1948 |journal=Personality and Political Culture in Modern Africa: Studies Presented to Professor Harold G Marcus, ed.

In keeping with the principle of [[collective security]], for which he was an outspoken proponent, Haile Selassie sent a contingent, under General Mulugueta Bulli, known as the [[Kagnew Battalion]], to take part in the [[Korean War]] by supporting the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]]. It was attached to the American [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], and fought in a number of engagements including the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.geocities.com/lmak27455/Ethiopian_Korean_War_Veterans/help.html | title = Ethiopian Korean War Veterans | publisher = Yahoo! | work = Geo cities | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081225170405/http://www.geocities.com/lmak27455/Ethiopian_Korean_War_Veterans/help.html | archivedate = 25 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1954 speech, the Selassie spoke of Ethiopian participation in the [[Korean War]] as a redemption of the principles of collective security:
{{Quote |Nearly two decades ago, I personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security, for surely, at that time and for the first time in world history, that issue was posed in all its clarity. My searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if, after untold sufferings and, indeed, unaided resistance at the time of aggression, we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in Korea, I can only be thankful that God gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel, Ras (2004), ''50th Anniversary of His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I''.

During the celebrations of his Silver Jubilee in November 1955, Haile Selassie introduced a [[1955 Constitution of Ethiopia|revised constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.country-studies.com/ethiopia/administrative-change-and-the-1955-constitution.html |title=Ethiopia Administrative Change and the 1955 Constitution |publisher= Country studies |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby he retained effective power, while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body.  Party politics were not provided for. Modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the Empire. The country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization, tempered by Ethiopian traditions, and within the framework of the state's ancient monarchical structure.

Haile Selassie compromised, when practical, with the traditionalists in the nobility and church. He also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups, and granted autonomy to [[Afar people|Afar]] lands that were difficult to control. Still, his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy.  The Revised Constitution of 1955 has been criticized for reasserting &quot;the indisputable power of the monarch&quot; and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants.&lt;ref name=mammo /&gt;

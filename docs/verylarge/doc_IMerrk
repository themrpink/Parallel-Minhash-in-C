The depth and shape of Death Valley strongly influence its climate. The valley is a long, narrow basin that descends below sea level and is walled by high, steep mountain ranges. The clear, dry air and sparse plant cover allow sunlight to heat the desert surface. Summer nights provide little relief: overnight lows may dip just into the {{convert|82|to|98|F|C}} range. Moving masses of super-heated air blow through the valley, creating extremely high temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Park Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=National Park Service|work=Death Valley|title=Weather and Climate|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/upload/Weather%20and%20Climate.pdf|publisher=NPS.gov|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest surface temperature ever recorded in Death Valley was {{convert|201.0|°F|1}}, on July 15, 1972, at [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]], which is the highest ground surface temperature ever recorded on earth, as well as the only recorded surface temperature of above {{convert|200|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroundTemp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kubecka |first1=Paul |year=2001 |title=A possible world record maximum natural ground surface temperature |journal=Weather |volume=56 |issue=7|pages=218–221 |doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.2001.tb06577.x |bibcode=2001Wthr...56..218K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest number of consecutive days with a maximum temperature of at least {{convert|100|°F}} was 154, in the summer of 2001.

[[File:Lake Badwater, Death Valley, 2005.jpg|thumb|A [[Landsat 5]] satellite photo of Lake Badwater on February 9, 2005]]
[[File:Badwater tm5 2007046.jpg|thumb|A Landsat 5 satellite photo of [[Badwater Basin]] [[dry lake]] on February 15, 2007]]

In 2005, Death Valley received four times its average annual rainfall of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}. As it has done before for hundreds of years, the lowest spot in the valley filled with a wide, shallow lake, but the extreme heat and aridity immediately began evaporating the [[ephemeral lake]].

The pair of images (seen at right) from NASA's [[Landsat 5]] satellite documents the short history of Death Valley's [[Lake Badwater]]: formed in February 2005 (top) and evaporated by February 2007 (bottom). In 2005, a big pool of greenish water stretched most of the way across the valley floor. By May 2005 the valley floor had resumed its more familiar role as [[Badwater Basin]], a salt-coated [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]. In time, this freshly dissolved and recrystallized salt will darken.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Jason (2019). [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/flooding-creates-10-mile-long-lake-death-valley-180971699/ Flooding Creates a 10-Mile-Long Lake in Death Valley]. Smithsonian Magazine. Retrieved June 29, 2020. &lt;/ref&gt;

The western margin of Death Valley is traced by [[alluvial fan]]s. During [[flash flood]]s, rainfall from the steep mountains to the west pours through narrow canyons, picking up everything from fine clay to large rocks. When these torrents reach the mouths of the canyons, they widen and slow, branching out into distributary channels. The paler the fans, the younger they are.

==Ecology==
[[File:Death Valley Gerea canescens.jpg|thumb|Death Valley in 2005 springtime bloom]]
In spite of the overwhelming heat and sparse rainfall, Death Valley exhibits considerable biodiversity. Wildflowers, watered by snowmelt, carpet the desert floor each spring, continuing into June.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR.org&quot;/&gt; [[Bighorn sheep]], [[red-tailed hawks]], and [[wild burros]] may be seen. Death Valley has over 600 springs and ponds. Salt Creek, a mile-long shallow depression in the center of the valley, supports [[Death Valley Pupfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sean Lema 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-phenotypic-plasticity-of-death-valleys-pupfish/1|title=Phenotypic Plasticity of Death Valley's Pupfish|first=Sean|last=Lema|magazine=American Scientist|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These isolated pupfish populations are remnants of the wetter Pleistocene climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sean Lema 2008&quot;/&gt;

[[Darwin Falls]], on the western edge of Death Valley Monument, falls {{convert|100|ft|m}} into a large pond surrounded by willows and cottonwood trees. Over 80 species of birds have been spotted around the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Not So Dead|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|date=May 2008|page=30|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/points-of-interest-37244965/|first1=Matt|last1=Kettmann|first2=Paul|last2=Grondahl|first3=Monica|last3=Watrous|first4=Nan|last4=Chase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Death Valley is home to the [[Timbisha]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], formerly known as the Panamint Shoshone, who have inhabited the valley for at least the past millennium. The Timbisha name for the valley, ''tümpisa'', means &quot;rock paint&quot; and refers to the [[red ochre]] paint that can be made from a type of [[clay]] found in the valley. Some families still live in the valley at Furnace Creek. Another village was in Grapevine Canyon near the present site of [[Scotty's Castle]]. It was called in the [[Timbisha language]] ''maahunu'', whose meaning is uncertain, although it is known that ''hunu'' means &quot;canyon&quot;.

The valley received its English name in 1849 during the [[California Gold Rush]]. It was called Death Valley by prospectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lingenfelter|first=Richard E.|author2=Dwyer, Richard A.|title=Death Valley Lore, Classic Tales of Fantasy, Adventure and Mystery|location=Reno|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=1988|isbn=0-87417-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others who sought to cross the valley on their way to the gold fields, after 13 pioneers perished from one early expedition of wagon trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manly|first1=William Lewis|title=Death Valley in '49|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12236|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=The Pacific Tree and Vine Co.|date=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Jerry|title=Paradise Found|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/reynolds/part19.html|publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1850s, gold and silver were extracted in the valley. In the 1880s, [[borax]] was discovered and extracted by [[twenty mule team|mule-drawn wagons]].
{{wide image|Zbriskie Point South Panorama 2012.jpg|800px|[[Badlands]] at [[Zabriskie Point]] in Death Valley}}

Death Valley National Monument was proclaimed on February 11, 1933, by President [[Herbert Hoover]], placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the monument was redesignated as [[Death Valley National Park]], as well as being substantially expanded to include Saline and Eureka Valleys.

In [[mathematics]], a '''continued fraction''' is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] obtained through an [[iterative]] process of representing a number as the sum of its [[integer part]] and the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/135043/continued-fraction|title=Continued fraction – mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a '''finite continued fraction''' (or '''terminated continued fraction'''), the iteration/[[recursion]] is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an '''infinite continued fraction''' is an [[infinite expression (mathematics)|infinite expression]]. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be [[positive number|positive]]. The integers &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[coefficient]]s or [[term (mathematics)|terms]] of the continued fraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettofrezzo 1970 150&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued fractions have a number of remarkable properties related to the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for integers or [[real number]]s. Every [[rational number]] {{sfrac|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;}} has two closely related expressions as a finite continued fraction, whose coefficients {{mvar|a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be determined by applying the Euclidean algorithm to &lt;math&gt;(p,q)&lt;/math&gt;. The numerical value of an infinite continued fraction is [[irrational number|irrational]]; it is defined from its infinite sequence of integers as the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a sequence of values for finite continued fractions. Each finite continued fraction of the sequence is obtained by using a finite [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of the infinite continued fraction's defining sequence of integers. Moreover, every irrational number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the value of a ''unique'' infinite continued fraction, whose coefficients can be found using the non-terminating version of the Euclidean algorithm applied to the [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] values &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and 1. This way of expressing real numbers (rational and irrational) is called their ''continued fraction representation''.

It is generally assumed that the [[numerator]] of all of the fractions is 1. If arbitrary values and/or [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are used in place of one or more of the numerators or the integers in the denominators, the resulting expression is a '''[[generalized continued fraction]]'''. When it is necessary to distinguish the first form from generalized continued fractions, the former may be called a '''simple''' or '''regular continued fraction''', or said to be in '''canonical form'''.

The term ''continued fraction'' may also refer to representations of [[rational function]]s, arising in their [[analytic function|analytic theory]]. For this use of the term, see [[Padé approximation]] and [[Chebyshev rational functions]].

==Motivation and notation==
Consider, for example, the [[rational number]] {{sfrac|415|93}}, which is around 4.4624. As a first [[approximation]], start with 4, which is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integer part]]; {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|415|93}} = 4 + {{sfrac|43|93}}}}. The fractional part is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{sfrac|93|43}} which is about 2.1628. Use the integer part, 2, as an approximation for the reciprocal to obtain a second approximation of {{nowrap |1=4 + {{sfrac|1|2}} = 4.5; {{sfrac|93|43}} = 2 + {{sfrac|7|43}}}}.
The remaining fractional part, {{sfrac|7|43}}, is the reciprocal of {{sfrac|43|7}}, and {{sfrac|43|7}} is around 6.1429. Use 6 as an approximation for this to obtain {{nowrap|2 + {{sfrac|1|6}}}} as an approximation for {{sfrac|93|43}} and {{nowrap|4 + {{sfrac|1|2 + {{sfrac|1|6}}}}}}, about 4.4615, as the third approximation; {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|43|7}} = 6 + {{sfrac|1|7}}}}. Finally, the fractional part, {{sfrac|1|7}}, is the reciprocal of 7, so its approximation in this scheme, 7, is exact ({{nowrap|1={{sfrac|7|1}} = 7 + {{sfrac|0|1}}}}) and produces the exact expression {{nowrap|4 + {{sfrac|1|2 + {{sfrac|1|6 + {{sfrac|1|7}}}}}}}} for {{sfrac|415|93}}.

The expression {{nowrap|4 + {{sfrac|1|2 + {{sfrac|1|6 + {{sfrac|1|7}}}}}}}} is called the continued fraction representation of {{sfrac|415|93}}. This can be represented by the abbreviated notation {{sfrac|415|93}} = [4; 2, 6, 7]. (It is customary to replace only the ''first'' comma by a semicolon.) Some older textbooks use all commas in the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-tuple, for example, [4, 2, 6, 7].&lt;ref name=&quot;Long 1972 173&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettofrezzo 1970 152&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the starting number is rational, then this process exactly parallels the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. In particular, it must terminate and produce a finite continued fraction representation of the number. If the starting number is [[Irrational number|irrational]], then the process continues indefinitely. This produces a sequence of approximations, all of which are rational numbers, and these converge to the starting number as a limit. This is the (infinite) continued fraction representation of the number. Examples of continued fraction representations of irrational numbers are:
* {{math|1={{sqrt|19}} = [4;2,1,3,1,2,8,2,1,3,1,2,8,...]}} {{OEIS|A010124}}. The pattern repeats indefinitely with a period of 6.
* {{math|1=[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']] = [2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,...]}} {{OEIS|A003417}}. The pattern repeats indefinitely with a period of 3 except that 2 is added to one of the terms in each cycle.
* {{math|1=[[Pi|π]] = [3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,...]}} {{OEIS|A001203}}. No pattern has ever been found in this representation.
* {{math|1=[[golden ratio|ϕ]] = [1;1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...]}} {{OEIS|A000012}}. The [[golden ratio]], the irrational number that is the &quot;most difficult&quot; to approximate rationally. See: [[#A property of the golden ratio φ|A property of the golden ratio φ]].

Continued fractions are, in some ways, more &quot;mathematically natural&quot; representations of a [[real number]] than other representations such as [[decimal representation]]s, and they have several desirable properties:
* The continued fraction representation for a rational number is finite and only rational numbers have finite representations. In contrast, the decimal representation of a rational number may be finite, for example {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|137|1600}} = 0.085625}}, or infinite with a repeating cycle, for example {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|4|27}} = 0.148148148148...}}
* Every rational number has an essentially unique continued fraction representation. Each rational can be represented in exactly two ways, since {{math|1=[''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] = [''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;−1),1]}}. Usually the first, shorter one is chosen as the [[canonical form|canonical representation]].
* The continued fraction representation of an irrational number is unique.
* The real numbers whose continued fraction eventually repeats are precisely the [[quadratic irrational]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Periodic Continued Fraction|urlname=PeriodicContinuedFraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the repeating continued fraction {{nowrap|[1;1,1,1,...]}} is the [[golden ratio]], and the repeating continued fraction {{nowrap|[1;2,2,2,...]}} is the [[square root of 2]]. In contrast, the decimal representations of quadratic irrationals are apparently [[normal number|random]]. The square roots of all (positive) integers, that are not perfect squares, are quadratic irrationals, hence are unique periodic continued fractions.
* The successive approximations generated in finding the continued fraction representation of a number, that is, by truncating the continued fraction representation, are in a certain sense (described below) the &quot;best possible&quot;.

== Basic formula ==
A continued fraction is an expression of the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 + \cfrac{b_1}{a_1 + \cfrac{b_2}{a_2 + \cfrac{b_3}{a_3 + {_\ddots}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can be any complex numbers. Usually they are required to be integers.
If b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for all ''i'' the expression is called a ''simple'' continued fraction.
If the expression contains a finite number of terms, it is called a ''finite'' continued fraction.
If the expression contains an infinite number of terms, it is called an ''infinite'' continued fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Darren C. |last=Collins |title=Continued Fractions |journal=MIT Undergraduate Journal of Mathematics |url=http://www-math.mit.edu/phase2/UJM/vol1/COLLIN~1.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011120064343/http://www-math.mit.edu/phase2/UJM/vol1/COLLIN~1.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating continued fraction representations==
Consider a real number {{mvar|r}}.
Let &lt;math&gt;i=\lfloor r \rfloor &lt;/math&gt; be the [[integer part]] of {{mvar|r}} and let
&lt;math&gt;f = r - i&lt;/math&gt; be the [[fractional part]] of {{mvar|r}}.
Then the continued fraction representation of {{mvar|r}} is
&lt;math&gt;[i;a_1,a_2,\ldots]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;[a_1;a_2,\ldots]&lt;/math&gt; is the continued fraction representation of &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt;.

To calculate a continued fraction representation of a number {{mvar|r}}, write down the integer part (technically the [[Floor function|floor]]) of {{mvar|r}}. Subtract this integer part from {{mvar|r}}. If the difference is 0, stop; otherwise find the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the difference and repeat. The procedure will halt if and only if {{mvar|r}} is rational. This process can be efficiently implemented using the [[Euclidean algorithm]] when the number is rational.  The table below shows an implementation of this procedure for the number 3.245, resulting in the continued fraction expansion [3; 4,12,4].

==Notations==
The integers &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; etc., are called the ''coefficients'' or ''terms'' of the continued fraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettofrezzo 1970 150&quot;/&gt; One can abbreviate the continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

in the notation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]
:&lt;math&gt;x = a_0 + \underset{i=1}{\overset{3}{\mathrm K}} ~ \frac{1}{a_i} &lt;/math&gt;

or as

'''Plastic surgery''' is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: '''reconstructive surgery''' and '''cosmetic surgery'''. [[Reconstructive surgery]] includes [[craniofacial surgery]], [[hand surgery]], [[microsurgery]], and the treatment of [[burn]]s. While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery aims at improving the appearance of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/patient-care/cosmetic-surgery/what-is-cosmetic-surgery/|title=What is Cosmetic Surgery|website=Royal College of Surgeons|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Plastic Surgery Specialty Description | publisher = American Medical Association | url = https://www.ama-assn.org/specialty/plastic-surgery-specialty-description | accessdate = 13 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these techniques are used throughout the world.

==Etymology==
The word ''plastic'' in ''plastic surgery'' means 'reshaping' and comes from the Greek πλαστική (τέχνη), ''plastikē'' (''tekhnē''), &quot;the art of modelling&quot; of malleable [[Tissue (biology)|flesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.'' [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/145291 'plastic']&lt;/ref&gt;  This meaning in English is seen as early as 1598.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic-surgery|title=plastic surgery {{!}} Britannica.com|website=OED Online|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgical definition of &quot;plastic&quot; first appeared in 1839, preceding the modern &quot;engineering material made from petroleum&quot; sense by 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plastic|publisher=Etymonline|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aulus Cornelius Celsus.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The Roman scholar [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] recorded surgical techniques, including plastic surgery, in the first century AD.]]
The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] also performed plastic cosmetic surgery. The Romans were able to perform simple techniques, such as repairing damaged ears, from around the 1st century BC. For religious reasons, they did not dissect either human beings or animals, thus their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] predecessors. Notwithstanding, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] left some surprisingly accurate anatomical descriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang H. Vogel, Andreas Berke (2009). &quot;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5pzrF1QocC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Brief History of Vision and Ocular Medicine]''&quot;. Kugler Publications. p.97. {{ISBN|90-6299-220-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which — for instance, his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton — are of special interest to plastic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;P. Santoni-Rugiu, ''A History of Plastic Surgery'' (2007){{pn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1465, Sabuncu's book, description, and classification of [[hypospadias]] was more informative and up to date. Localization of [[urethral meatus]] was described in detail. Sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In mid-15th-century Europe, Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process &quot;to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely, and the dogs have devoured it&quot; by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place. However, because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form, especially that involving the head or face, it was not [[history of surgery|until the 19th and 20th centuries]] that such surgery became common.

Up until the use of [[anesthesia]] became established, surgeries involving healthy tissues involved great [[pain]]. Infection from surgery was reduced by the introduction of sterile techniques and disinfectants. The invention and use of antibiotics, beginning with [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and [[penicillin]], was another step in making [[elective surgery]] possible.

In 1793, [[François Chopart]] performed operative procedure on a lip using a flap from the neck. In 1814, Joseph Carpue successfully performed operative procedure on a British military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] treatments. In 1818, German surgeon [[Carl Ferdinand von Graefe]] published his major work entitled ''Rhinoplastik''. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap.

The first American plastic surgeon was [[John Peter Mettauer]], who, in 1827, performed the first [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] operation with instruments that he designed himself. In 1845, [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty, titled ''Operative Chirurgie'', and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose.

In 1891, American [[Otorhinolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologist]] John Roe presented an example of his work: a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications. In 1892, Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts (duck sternum) in the reconstruction of sunken noses. In 1896, [[James Israel]], a urological surgeon from Germany, and in 1889 George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free-bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects. In 1898, Jacques Joseph, the German orthopaedic-trained surgeon, published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty. In 1928, Jacques Joseph published ''Nasenplastik und Sonstige Gesichtsplastik''.

==Development of modern techniques==
[[File:Walter Yeo skin graft.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Yeo]], a sailor injured at the [[Battle of Jutland]], is assumed to have received plastic surgery in 1917. The photograph shows him before (left) and after (right) receiving a [[flap surgery]] by Sir Harold Gillies.]]

The father of modern plastic surgery is generally considered to have been Sir [[Harold Gillies]]. A New Zealand otolaryngologist working in London, he developed many of the techniques of modern facial surgery in caring for soldiers suffering from disfiguring facial injuries during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181bc327a |pmid=20431512 |title=Achieving Growth and Excellence in Medicine |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=473–478 |year=2009 |last1=Chambers |first1=James Alan |last2=Ray |first2=Peter Damian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] he worked as a medical minder with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. After working with the renowned French [[oral and maxillofacial surgeon]] [[Hippolyte Morestin]] on skin graft, he persuaded the army's chief surgeon, [[William Arbuthnot-Lane|Arbuthnot-Lane]], to establish a facial injury ward at the [[Cambridge Military Hospital]], [[Aldershot]], later upgraded to a new hospital for facial repairs at [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup|Sidcup]] in 1917. There Gillies and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery; more than 11,000 operations were performed on more than 5,000 men (mostly soldiers with facial injuries, usually from gunshot wounds).{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Content is found in multiple pages, no definite source.}} After the war, Gillies developed a private practice with Rainsford Mowlem, including many famous patients, and travelled extensively to promote his advanced techniques worldwide.

In 1930, Gillies' cousin, [[Archibald McIndoe]], joined the practice and became committed to plastic surgery. When [[World War II]] broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the [[British armed forces|armed forces]], and Gillies and his team were split up. Gillies himself was sent to [[Park Prewett|Rooksdown House]] near [[Basingstoke]], which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and who now has a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek retractor) went to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton; and Mowlem went to St Albans. McIndoe, consultant to the RAF, moved to the recently rebuilt [[Queen Victoria Hospital]] in [[East Grinstead]], [[Sussex]], and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burn, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Content is found in multiple pages, no definite source.}}

McIndoe is often recognized for not only developing new techniques for treating badly burned faces and hands but also for recognising the importance of the rehabilitation of the casualties and particularly of social reintegration back into normal life. He disposed of the &quot;convalescent uniforms&quot; and let the patients use their service uniforms instead. With the help of two friends, Neville and Elaine Blond, he also convinced the locals to support the patients and invite them to their homes. McIndoe kept referring to them as &quot;his boys&quot; and the staff called him &quot;The Boss&quot; or &quot;The Maestro.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=Content is found in multiple pages, no definite source.}}

His other important work included development of the [[walking-stalk skin graft]], and the discovery that immersion in [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] promoted healing as well as improving survival rates for victims with extensive burns — this was a serendipitous discovery drawn from observation of differential healing rates in pilots who had come down on land and in the sea. His radical, experimental treatments led to the formation of the [[Guinea Pig Club]] at [[Queen Victoria Hospital]], [[Sussex]]. Among the better-known members of his &quot;club&quot; were [[Richard Hillary]], [[Bill Foxley]] and [[Jimmy Edwards]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Content is found in multiple pages, no definite source.}}

==Sub-specialties==
{{Merge portions from|Cosmetic_surgery_in_Australia#Types of cosmetic surgery available|date=April 2020}}
Plastic surgery is a broad field, and may be subdivided further. In the United States, plastic surgeons are board certified by [[American Board of Plastic Surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutIntro |title=Introduction |date=2013 |publisher=American Board of Plastic Surgery |accessdate=4 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202180933/https://www.abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutIntro |archive-date=2 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subdisciplines of plastic surgery may include:

===Aesthetic surgery===
Aesthetic surgery is a central component of plastic surgery and includes facial and body aesthetic surgery. Plastic surgeons use cosmetic surgical principles in all reconstructive surgical procedures as well as isolated operations to improve overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Description of Plastic Surgery [https://www.abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutDPS American Board of Plastic Surgery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015000138/https://abplsurg.org/ModDefault.aspx?section=AboutDPS |date=15 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burn surgery===
Burn surgery generally takes place in two phases. Acute burn surgery is the treatment immediately after a burn. Reconstructive burn surgery takes place after the burn wounds have healed.

===Craniofacial surgery===
{{Main|Craniofacial surgery}}
[[Craniofacial surgery]] is divided into pediatric and adult craniofacial surgery. Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues, such as cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and pediatric fractures. Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with orthognathic surgery. Craniofacial surgery is an important part of all plastic surgery training programs. Further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a [[craniofacial fellowship]]. Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial surgeons]].

===Hand surgery===
{{Main|Hand surgery}}
[[Hand surgery]] is concerned with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). Hand surgery is an important part of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The hand surgery field is also practiced by [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeons]] and [[general surgery|general surgeons]]. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2014/08/hand-surgery-for-better-engagement-ring-selfies-before-and-after-shots/|title=Hand Rejuvenation for Better Engagement Ring Selfies|author=ABC News|website=ABC News|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsurgery===
{{Main|Microsurgery}}
[[Microsurgery]] is generally concerned with the reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels. Popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction, head and neck reconstruction, hand surgery/replantation, and brachial plexus surgery.

===Pediatric plastic surgery===
{{Main|Pediatric plastic surgery}}
Children often face medical issues very different from the experiences of an adult patient. Many [[birth defects]] or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and [[pediatric]] plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include [[craniofacial team|craniofacial anomalies]], Syndactyly&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1244420|Syndactyly}}&lt;/ref&gt; (webbing of the fingers and toes), Polydactyly (excess fingers and toes at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.

==Techniques and procedures==
In plastic surgery, the transfer of skin tissue ([[skin graft]]ing) is a very common procedure. Skin grafts can be derived from the recipient or donors:
* [[Autograft]]s are taken from the recipient. If absent or deficient of natural tissue, alternatives can be cultured sheets of [[epithelial cell]]s ''in vitro'' or synthetic compounds, such as integra, which consists of [[silicone]] and bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans.
* [[Allograft]]s are taken from a donor of the same species.
* [[Xenograft]]s are taken from a donor of a different species.

Usually, good results would be expected from plastic surgery that emphasize careful planning of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of [[wound closure]], use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.{{original research inline|date=July 2017}},&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thieme.com/media/samples/pubid1143527561.pdf Reconstructive Plastic Surgery of the Face&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstructive surgery==
[[File:US Navy 080811-N-9689V-004 Operation Smile volunteers Dr. Robert Russell, a plastic surgeon from Springfield, Ill., and his assistant Maria Velasquez, perform reconstructive surgery on 21-year-old Solomon Maitava.jpg|thumb|right|Navy doctors perform reconstructive surgery on a 21-year-old patient]]
Reconstructive plastic surgery is performed to correct functional impairments caused by burns; traumatic injuries, such as facial bone fractures and breaks; congenital abnormalities, such as cleft palates or cleft lips; developmental abnormalities; infection and disease; and [[cancer]] or [[tumor]]s. The goal of reconstructive plastic surgery is to restore both form and function.

The most common reconstructive procedures are tumor removal, laceration repair, maxillofacial surgery, scar revision, hand surgery and [[breast reduction plasty]]. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the number of reconstructive breast reductions for women decreased in 2018 by 4 percent from the year before. Breast reduction in men decreased in 2018 by 8 percent. In 2018, there were 57,535 performed.

Some other common reconstructive surgical procedures include [[breast reconstruction]] after a [[mastectomy]] for the treatment of cancer, cleft lip and palate surgery, [[Burn scar contracture|contracture]] surgery for [[Burn (injury)|burn]] survivors, and creating a new outer ear when one is congenitally absent.

Plastic surgeons use microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available. [[Free flap]]s of skin, muscle, bone, fat, or a combination may be removed from the body, moved to another site on the body, and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter.

Cosmetic surgery is a voluntary or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person's appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Documents/news-resources/statistics/2014-statistics/plastic-surgery-statsitics-full-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402095506/http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Documents/news-resources/statistics/2014-statistics/plastic-surgery-statsitics-full-report.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticplasticsurgerystatistics.com/statistics-2001.html|title=2001 Cosmetic Surgery Statistics|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery, and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include [[Botox]] and [[laser hair removal]]. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical (p.&amp;nbsp;5). They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people (p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery|title=Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics|journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal|date=2010|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) estimates that more than 333,000 cosmetic procedures were performed on patients 18 years of age or younger in the US in 2005 compared to approx. 14,000 in 1996. This is significant because it encourages younger people to continue these procedures later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2008.04.018 |pmid=18809128 |title=Teenagers and Cosmetic Surgery: Focus on Breast Augmentation and Liposuction |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=318–324 |year=2008 |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Diana |last2=Abraham |first2=Anisha }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses [[ethnic plastic surgery|racial and ethnic lines]] in the U.S., with increases seen among African-Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans. Of 1191 UK newspaper articles, 89% used the term ‘plastic surgery’ in the context of cosmetic surgery. This is significant as it shows the frequency in which the western world portrays cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2008.06.012 |pmid=18675242 |title=Plastic Surgery in the Press |journal=Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Aesthetic Surgery |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=866–869 |year=2008 |last1=Reid |first1=A.J |last2=Malone |first2=P.S.C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, cosmetic surgery has become more popular, and countries such as China and India have become Asia's biggest cosmetic surgery markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/news/20100809/india-china-among-plastic-surgery-capitals India, China Among Plastic Surgery Hot Spots] – WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea is also rising in popularity due to their expertise in facial bone surgeries. The first publication by a team of South Korean surgeons on facial bone contouring surgeries was published illustrating various surgery methods used for facial bone contouring surgeries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Facial bone contouring surgery: a practical guide|date=2017|publisher=Springer|last=Park |first=Sanghoon |isbn=9789811027260|location=Singapore|oclc=1004601615}}{{pn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic surgery is increasing slowly, rising 115% from 2000 to 2015. &quot;According to the annual plastic surgery procedural statistics, there were 15.9 million surgical and minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the United States in 2015, a 2 percent increase over 2014.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/new-statistics-reflect-the-changing-face-of-plastic-surgery|title=New Statistics Reflect the Changing Face of Plastic Surgery|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, 15,000 Americans underwent cosmetic surgery procedures. By 1969, this number rose to almost half a million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1971-09-27|title=Plastic Surgery|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/27/archives/its-no-longer-reserved-for-the-vain-and-rich.html|access-date=2020-08-25|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular aesthetic/cosmetic procedures include:
* [[Abdominoplasty]] (&quot;tummy tuck&quot;): reshaping and firming of the [[abdomen]]
* [[Blepharoplasty]] (&quot;eyelid surgery&quot;): reshaping of upper/lower eyelids including [[Asian blepharoplasty]]
* [[Phalloplasty]] (&quot;penile surgery&quot;): construction (or reconstruction) of a penis or, sometimes, artificial modification of the penis by surgery, often for cosmetic purposes

The most popular surgeries are Botox, liposuction, eyelid surgery, breast implants, nose jobs, and facelifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/beauty/treatments/most-popular-cosmetic-procedures|title=The Most Popular Cosmetic Procedures|website=WebMD|accessdate=12 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910172447/http://www.webmd.com/beauty/treatments/most-popular-cosmetic-procedures|archive-date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications, risks, and reversals==
All surgery has risks. Common complications of cosmetic surgery includes [[hematoma]], nerve damage, infection, scarring, implant failure and organ damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/most-common-plastic-surgery-complications|title=The 10 Most Common Plastic Surgery Complications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Plastic-surgery/Pages/Complications.aspx|title=Plastic surgery – Complications – NHS Choices|first=NHS|last=Choices|website=www.nhs.uk|date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cosmetic-surgery/basics/risks/prc-20022389|title=Cosmetic surgery Risks – Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Breast implants]] can have many [[Breast implant#Complications|complications]], including rupture. In 2011 FDA stated that one in five patients who received implants for breast augmentation will need them removed within 10 years of implantation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm260235.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological disorders==
Though media and advertising do play a large role in influencing many people's lives, such as by making people believe plastic surgery to be an acceptable course to change our identities to our liking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1749975510391583 |title='I Want to Look Like That!': Cosmetic Surgery and Celebrity Culture |journal=Cultural Sociology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=463–477 |year=2011 |last1=Elliott |first1=Anthony |citeseerx=10.1.1.1028.8768 |s2cid=145370171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers believe that plastic surgery obsession is linked to psychological disorders like [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Rafael Vilela Eiras|date=2017|title=Prevalence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder in Plastic Surgery and Dermatology Patients: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis|journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery|volume=41|issue=4|pages=964–970|doi=10.1007/s00266-017-0869-0|issn=1432-5241|pmid=28411353|s2cid=29619456}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists a correlation between sufferers of BDD and the predilection toward cosmetic plastic surgery in order to correct a perceived defect in their appearance.&lt;ref name=PMJBDD&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pmj.2003.015289 |pmid=14970291 |pmc=1742928 |title=Body dysmorphic disorder |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=80 |issue=940 |pages=67–71 |year=2004 |last1=Veale |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDD is a disorder resulting in the sufferer becoming &quot;preoccupied with what they regard as defects in their bodies or faces.&quot; Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive.&lt;ref name=PMJBDD /&gt; While 2% of people suffer from body dysmorphic disorder in the United States, 15% of patients seeing a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeons have the disorder. Half of the patients with the disorder who have cosmetic surgery performed are not pleased with the aesthetic outcome. BDD can lead to suicide in some of its sufferers. While many with BDD seek cosmetic surgery, the procedures do not treat BDD, and can ultimately worsen the problem. The psychological root of the problem is usually unidentified; therefore causing the treatment to be even more difficult. Some say that the fixation or obsession with correction of the area could be a sub-disorder such as anorexia or muscle dysmorphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16193565 |year=2005 |last1=Miller |first1=M. C |title=What is body dysmorphic disorder? |journal=The Harvard Mental Health Letter |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as [[Snapchat]] and [[Facetune]] have been identified as a potential triggers of BDD. Recently, a phenomenon referred to as 'Snapchat dysmorphia' has appeared to describe people who request surgery to resemble the edited version of themselves as they appear through Snapchat Filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=MEDICAL CENTER |first1=BOSTON |title=A new reality for beauty standards: How selfies and filters affect body image |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-08/bmc-anr080118.php |website=eurekalert |publisher=the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) |accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a protest to the detrimental trend, Instagram banned all augmented reality (AR) filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053|title=Instagram bans 'cosmetic surgery' filters|date=23 October 2019|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, people whose physicians refuse to perform any further surgeries, have turned to &quot;[[self-surgery|do it yourself]]&quot; plastic surgery, injecting themselves and running extreme safety risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Canning | first = Andrea | title = Woman's DIY Plastic Surgery 'Nightmare' | newspaper = ABC News | date = 20 July 2009 | url = https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8080723&amp;page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IpcressFile.JPG|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]])]]
'''''The IPCRESS File''''' is [[Len Deighton]]'s first [[spy novel]], published in 1962. The story involves [[Cold War]] [[brainwashing]], includes scenes in [[Lebanon]] and on an atoll for a United States [[Nuclear weapons testing|atomic weapon test]], as well as information about [[Joe One]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s first atomic bomb. The story was made into [[The Ipcress File (film)|a film]] in 1965 produced by [[Harry Saltzman]], directed by [[Sidney J. Furie]] and starring [[Michael Caine]].

==Plot==
The novel is framed as the unnamed protagonist delivering his personal report on &quot;the IPCRESS affair&quot; directly to the [[Minister of Defence (United Kingdom)|Minister of Defence]], thus making the novel itself the 'IPCRESS File' of the title. The events begin soon after his transfer from [[military intelligence]] to WOOC(P), a small civilian intelligence agency reporting directly to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], where he works under the command of a man named Dalby. An intelligence broker code-named &quot;Jay&quot; is suspected to be behind a series of kidnappings of highly placed and influential British VIPs with the intention of selling them to the Soviets, and the protagonist is assigned to meet with Jay to secure the release of &quot;Raven&quot;, a high-ranking scientist and his latest target. After meeting Jay at a sleazy [[Soho]] [[strip club]] to negotiate Raven's release, the protagonist is abandoned; investigating his surroundings, he discovers Raven's unconscious body in a back room and attempts to rescue him, but is unsuccessful.

WOOC(P) receives intelligence that Raven is to be transferred to the Soviets in [[Beirut]], and a rescue mission is organised with Dalby and the protagonist participating. The protagonist is assigned as a lookout while Dalby kills Raven's captors and rescues him. The protagonist is forced to kill the occupants of a car which suddenly arrives on the scene, to maintain the cover of the operation, believing them to be operatives working for Jay; they instead turn out to be members of the US [[Office of Naval Intelligence|ONI]]. The operation is otherwise a success and Raven is recovered, but the investigation into Jay continues. Dalby disappears, apparently going undercover, leaving the protagonist temporarily in charge of WOOC(P). At this point the protagonist's former superior from military intelligence, Colonel Ross, approaches the protagonist offering to sell him confidential information related to the affair. The protagonist rejects the offer in disgust, but begins to second-guess himself.

Carswell, a statistician from another department assigned to the matter, begins noting a range of bizarre and seemingly irrelevant links between many of the kidnap victims. A break suddenly appears when Housemartin, one of Jay's high-ranking operatives, is arrested in [[Shoreditch]] for impersonating a police officer, but the protagonist and Murray, another operative assigned to the case, arrive at the police station only to discover he has been murdered in his cell. Information from the arrest enables WOOC(P) and the police to storm one of Jay's safe-houses, but it has been abandoned. To help with the administration of the department, the protagonist is assigned an assistant, Jean, a beautiful young woman towards whom he begins to develop romantic feelings. Dalby re-emerges, and reveals intelligence suggesting that Jay's operations will interfere with an American [[neutron bomb]] test in the Pacific.

Dalby, Jean and the protagonist are sent to the test site as British observers, and while there the protagonist learns from an old friend, Barney, that the Americans suspect him of being a double-agent due to the deaths of the US operatives in Beirut. Jean reveals to the protagonist that Dalby has been visiting an abandoned Japanese bunker on the island. Soon after, Barney is killed in apparently suspicious circumstances, and while following Dalby to the scene the protagonist is present when the bomb test site is sabotaged, setting back the bomb test and killing a military police officer. The protagonist is arrested by the Americans and interrogated, before apparently being transferred to [[Hungary]] on suspicion of being a Soviet agent. There, he is drugged and subject to days of psychological and physical torture, and nearly cracks before eventually managing to escape—only to discover that he is in fact in London. The protagonist takes refuge with Charlie Cavendish, the father of a friend killed towards the end of the [[Second World War]], and attempts to reestablish contact with WOOC(P) without being arrested for treason. Charlie is killed by Jay's operatives, forcing the protagonist on the run; he approaches Dalby at his home, but discovers Dalby meeting with Murray, Jay and another of Jay's operatives—confirming the protagonist's suspicions that Dalby is in fact the traitor.

The protagonist is discovered by Murray, who reveals himself to be an undercover operative from military intelligence also investigating Dalby. The protagonist escapes, but is soon captured by Jay's operatives and taken to meet Jay—he has, however, allowed military intelligence to follow them, and Jay and Dalby are arrested by Colonel Ross. The protagonist reveals to Jean that Jay and Dalby were using a process called &quot;'''I'''nduction of '''P'''sycho-neuroses by '''C'''onditioned '''RE'''flex with '''S'''tres'''s'''&quot; (IPCRESS) to brainwash the VIPs into loyalty to the Soviet Union, which they had also unsuccessfully attempted to subject the protagonist to. The seemingly irrelevant links that Carswell had discovered were in fact indicators of the personality traits that Jay had used to determine which VIPs would easily succumb to the process. Dalby was the one who had spied on the American bomb test, as part of Jay and Dalby's efforts to frame the protagonist. Colonel Ross reveals that his attempt to sell information to the protagonist had been a test of his loyalty, which the protagonist had passed by rejecting it. The novel ends with the protagonist concluding his report to the Minister, revealing that Jay has turned and began working for the British, while Dalby has ostensibly died in a car accident.

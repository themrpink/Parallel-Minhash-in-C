He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. ...  He knew everyone worth knowing ... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding his opera company===
[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|right|thumb|Programme for ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', 1875]]
In 1874, Carte leased the [[Opera Comique]], a theatre off [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he presented [[Charles Lecocq]]'s new [[opéra bouffe]] ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Era'', 7 June 1874, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It did poor box-office business, and had to be closed after two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; He followed it with a modest success, ''The Broken Branch'', an English adaptation of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branche cassée''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: &quot;It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Our Representative Man&quot;, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' commented, &quot;Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opéra bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte later said it was &quot;the scheme of my life&quot; to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera,&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph, p. 11&quot;&gt;Joseph, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the crude [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–109; and Stedman, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in writing operettas had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], &quot;I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Carte became the business manager of the [[Royalty Theatre]], under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Selina Dolaro who was the licensee of the theatre and star of its production of Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act [[comic opera]] that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, ''Cox and Box'', had been revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref name=Ainger108&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. &quot;Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?&quot;, ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Trial by Jury'', a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning ''La Périchole'', and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 129–130; and Ainger, pp. 109 and 111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helen Carte Parasol.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Helen Carte]], formerly Helen Lenoir, Carte's assistant and second wife]]
In June 1875 the Royalty closed for the summer, and Dolaro took her company on tour. While ''Trial by Jury'' and ''La Périchole'' were playing at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in September,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Public Amusements&quot;, ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', 6 September 1875, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Carte met [[Michael Ralph Thomas Gunn|Michael Gunn]], a co-owner of the Gaiety. Gunn became a close friend of Carte's, later served as a manager in his theatrical company and was a shareholder and director in his hotel business.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 157, 169–171, 184, 193 and 283&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the initial production of ''Trial by Jury'' Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opéra bouffe (Offenbach's ''La Périchole'', and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'', Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' and [[Léon Vasseur]]'s ''La Timbale d'argent''), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury''). Carte was the musical director of this travelling company.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6; ''The Freeman's Journal'' (Dublin), 28 July 1876, p. 1; and ''The Era'', 23 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877 Carte, organising a company for a provincial tour of a successful London [[farce]], auditioned a novice actress called [[Helen Lenoir]]. He engaged her for a small role, but after a few weeks she left the tour and returned to London where she secured an office post in Carte's agency. She gradually assumed a key role in his business affairs and his personal life.&lt;ref name=s22&gt;Seeley, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Desprez]], the editor of ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', wrote: &quot;Her character exactly compensated for the deficiencies in his.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Desprez|Desprez, Frank]]. &quot;The Late Mrs. D'Oyly Carte&quot;, ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 10 May 1913, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte had been attempting since 1875 to raise money for either a revival of ''Thespis'' or a new piece.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 113 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 he finally found four backers and formed the &quot;Comedy Opera Company&quot; to produce new works by Gilbert and Sullivan, along with those of other British authors and composers.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars; Carte's agency provided many of them.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; and Ainger, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right that there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–148; and Jacobs, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorcerer'' was followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878. It opened to great enthusiasm but within days of the premiere London experienced an unusually strong and protracted heat wave,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;London&quot;, ''The Standard'', 28 June 1878, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and business in the ill-ventilated Opera Comique was badly affected.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, pp.  151–152&lt;/ref&gt; Takings dropped to £40 a night, and Carte's directors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, p. 152; Jacobs, p. 122; and Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who programmed some of the ''Pinafore'' music when he conducted a season of [[promenade concert]]s at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], the opera became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Carte convinced Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name &quot;[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–167&lt;/ref&gt; Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three partners was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the ''Pinafore'' set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–172&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723085638/http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html |date=23 July 2011 }}, ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

Sullivan commented that in the US there was a belief &quot;that a free and independent American citizen ought not to be robbed of his right of robbing someone else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to counter this [[copyright infringement|copyright piracy]] and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an &quot;authentic&quot; production of ''Pinafore'', beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt; Lenoir made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W.

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire [[front of house]] was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881.

===Peak years for the opera company===
During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Others were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which played the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the new works extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York records that, in addition to these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously managing many other projects. These included two companies touring with ''Patience'', two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]), one with ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by [[Archibald Forbes]] (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with J.

[[File:Iolanthe-programme-1882-Savoy.png|thumb|left|upright|''[[Iolanthe]]'', Carte's first new production at the Savoy, 1882]]
Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 81 and 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies &quot;support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to &quot;the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&quot;&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&quot;/&gt;

After ''Patience'', Carte produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, he signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his stockbroker went bankrupt in November 1882 and felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–219&lt;/ref&gt; The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, &quot;Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments.&quot;&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref name=Joseph27&gt;Joseph, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref name=jacobssullivan&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.

Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–233&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mikado-programme-1885-savoy.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Programme cover for original production of ''The Mikado'', 1885]]
Carte produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''The Mikado'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and &quot;picturesque&quot; Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. &quot;Japan in London 1885&quot;, ''W.

This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction.&lt;ref name=Wilson13/&gt; When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a &quot;dramatic work on a larger musical scale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a [[grand opera]] that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes, with an initial run of 554 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 13; and Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants);&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Lytton]], &quot;Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891.{{refn|Following the libretto closely, the queen noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done.

Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that &quot;I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt; Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte &quot;in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=Vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc. &quot;Introduction: Historical Context&quot;, ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.

Carte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera. When it finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' at first alternating in repertory with ''Ivanhoe'', and then ''La Basoche'' played alone, closing in January 1892.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. [[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], who as young man had been [[répétiteur]] for the production, recalled in his autobiography, &quot;If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time.

[[File:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
Because of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Vowed/&gt; When ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]] for his next piece, ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall]]'', which held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Savoyards on Tour&quot;, ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–374&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to their operas.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''. While that was being prepared, Carte staged ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]]. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn. &quot;Jane Annie&quot;, in the ''Sullivan Society Journal'', 1993 centenary issue on ''Utopia, Limited''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|upright|thumb|[[George Grossmith]] comforts Carte after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
''Utopia'' was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; Carte then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', by Messager, then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The company then toured the London suburbs, and the Savoy was leased to other managements until November, when Carte presented a revival of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1896 by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; At the Savoy, Carte produced ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as [[Henry Irving]], and for dramatists, including Gilbert.&lt;ref name=b128&gt;Baily, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Baily quotes Gilbert's description of mid-19th century productions as &quot;crude, unintelligent, and sometimes frankly improper&quot;&lt;ref name=b128/&gt;|group= n}} Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, &quot;Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The World'', 2 August 1893, ''quoted'' in Laurence, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In Carte's obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' noted, &quot;By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the ''mise en scène'' of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard&quot;.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan#Musical theatre|development of modern musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, pp. 120–133; and Jones, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'': &quot;Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the ''nouveaux riches'' of the British empire.... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ashburner, F.[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 &quot;Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846–1935)&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155827/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 |date=24 September 2015 }}, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006, accessed 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]], overseeing his management of a revival of ''Iolanthe'' and several new comic operas.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909 the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London.&lt;ref name=profit/&gt; The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bradley | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Bradley | title = Oh Joy!

The '''Napoleonic Wars''' (1803–1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]]. It produced a brief period of French domination over most of continental Europe. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]]. The wars are often categorised into five conflicts, each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] (1805), the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth]] (1806–07), the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth]] (1809), the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth]] (1813–14), and the [[Hundred Days|Seventh]] (1815).

Napoleon, upon [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|ascending to First Consul of France]] in 1799, had inherited [[French First Republic|a republic in chaos]]; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] formed the Third Coalition and waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October 1805. This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invasion of Britain itself]]. Concerned about increasing French power, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia, [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], and [[Sweden]], and the resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians at [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|Jena]] and the Russians at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]], bringing an [[Treaties of Tilsit|uneasy peace]] to the continent. The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, when the badly prepared Fifth Coalition, led by Austria, was quickly defeated at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]].

Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his [[Continental System]], Napoleon launched an [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal]], the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning [[Spanish royal family]] and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as [[Joseph Bonaparte|José I]]. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after [[Peninsular War|six years of fighting]].

Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a [[French invasion of Russia|massive invasion of Russia]] in 1812. The resulting campaign ended in disaster and the near destruction of Napoleon's ''[[Grande Armée]]''.

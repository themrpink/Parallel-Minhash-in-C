The choreographer [[Marius Petipa]], more famous for his collaborations with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] (on the ballets ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'') made another ballet adaptation for the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] with additional music and adaptations to Mendelssohn's score by [[Ludwig Minkus|Léon Minkus]]. The revival premiered 14 July 1876. English choreographer [[Frederick Ashton]] also created a 40-minute ballet version of the play, retitled to ''The Dream''. [[George Balanchine]] was another to create a ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet)|Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' ballet based on the play, using Mendelssohn's music.

Between 1917 and 1939 [[Carl Orff]] also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play, ''Ein Sommernachtstraum'' (performed in 1939). Since Mendelssohn's parents were Jews who converted to Lutheranism, his music had been banned by the Nazi regime, and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play: Orff was one of the musicians who responded. He later reworked the music for a final version, completed in 1964.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

&quot;Over Hill, Over Dale&quot;, from Act 2, is the third of the ''[[Three Shakespeare Songs]]'' set to music by the British composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. He wrote the pieces for a cappella SATB choir in 1951 for the British Federation of Music Festivals, and they remain a popular part of British choral repertoire today.

The [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|play was adapted into an opera]], with music by [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[libretto]] by Britten and [[Peter Pears]]. The opera was first performed on 11 June 1960 at [[Aldeburgh]].{{sfn|Whittall|1998}}

The theatre company, Moonwork put on a production of ''Midsummer'' in 1999. It was conceived by Mason Pettit, Gregory Sherman and Gregory Wolfe (who directed it). The show featured a rock-opera version of the play within a play, Pyramus &amp; Thisbe, with music written by [[Rusty Magee]]. The music for the rest of the show was written by Andrew Sherman.{{sfn|Marks|1999}}

''[[The Donkey Show (musical)|The Donkey Show]]'' is a disco-era experience based on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', that first appeared [[Off-Broadway|off Broadway]] in 1999.{{sfn|IOBDB|n.d.}}

In 1949 a three-act opera by [[Marcel Delannoy|Delannoy]] entitled ''[[Puck (opera)|Puck]]'' was premiered in Strasbourg. Progressive Rock guitarist [[Steve Hackett]], best known for his work with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], made a classical adaptation of the play in 1997. [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Henze)|Eighth Symphony]] is inspired by sequences from the play.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts Theatre Department presented the show as a musical adapted/directed by Beverly Blanchette (produced by Marcie Gorman) using the songs of [[The Moody Blues]]. The show was called ''Midsummer'' and was subsequently performed at Morsani Hall/Straz Performing Arts Center in Tampa, at the Florida State International Thespian Society Festival.

===Ballets===
* [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', his first original full-length ballet, was premiered by the [[New York City Ballet]] on 17 January 1962. It was chosen to open the NYCB's first season at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center in 1964. Balanchine interpolated further music by Mendelssohn into his ''Dream'', including the overture from ''[[Athalie]]''.{{sfn|Charles|2000}} A film version of the ballet was released in 1966.{{sfn|Barnes|1967}}
* [[Frederick Ashton]] created ''The Dream'', a short (not full-length) ballet set exclusively to the famous music by Félix Mendelssohn, arranged by [[John Lanchbery]], in 1964. It was created on England's Royal Ballet and has since entered the repertoire of other companies, notably The Joffrey Ballet and American Ballet Theatre.{{sfn|Charles|2000}}
* [[John Neumeier]] created his full-length ballet ''Ein Sommernachtstraum'' for his company at the Hamburg State Opera (Hamburgische Staatsoper) in 1977. Longer than Ashton's or Balanchine's earlier versions, Neumeier's version includes other music by Mendelssohn along with the ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' music, as well as music from the modern composer [[György Sándor Ligeti]], and jaunty barrel organ music. Neumeier devotes the three sharply differing musical styles to the three character groups, with the aristocrats and nobles dancing to Mendelssohn, the fairies to Ligeti, and the rustics or mechanicals to the barrel organ.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006}}
* [[Elvis Costello]] composed the music for a full-length ballet ''[[Il Sogno]]'', based on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. The music was subsequently released as a classical album by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 2004.

The '''Polychaeta''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ɪ|ˈ|k|iː|t|ə}}, also known as the '''bristle worms''' or '''polychaetes''', are a [[paraphyletic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Struck2011&quot; /&gt; class of [[annelid]] worms, generally marine.  Each body segment has a pair of fleshy protrusions called [[parapodia]] that bear many bristles, called [[chaeta]]e, which are made of [[chitin]]. More than 10,000 species are described in this class.  Common representatives include the [[lugworm]] (''Arenicola marina'') and the [[Alitta virens|sandworm]] or [[clam worm]] ''Alitta''.

Polychaetes as a class are robust and widespread, with species that live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the [[abyssal plain]], to forms which tolerate the extremely high temperatures near [[hydrothermal vent]]s. Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as [[plankton]] near the surface, to a 2- to 3-cm specimen (still unclassified) observed by the robot ocean probe [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''Nereus'']] at the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], the deepest known spot in the Earth's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Geography of Guam ] ns.gov.gu Accessed Oct. 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Only 168 species (less than 2% of all polychaetes) are known from fresh waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Cristopher |last1=Glasby |first2=Tarmo |last2=Timm |year=2008 |title=Global diversity of polychaetes (Polychaeta: Annelida) in freshwater |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |volume=595 |issue=1: Freshwater Animal Diversity Assessment |pages=107–115 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9008-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.655.4467 |s2cid=13143924 |editor1=E. V. Balian |editor2=C. Lévêque |editor3=H. Segers |editor4=K. Martens }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Polychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, although ranging at the extremes from {{convert|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, in ''[[Eunice aphroditois]]''. They can sometimes be brightly coloured, and may be [[iridescent]] or even [[luminescent]]. Each segment bears a pair of paddle-like and highly vascularized [[parapodia]], which are used for movement and, in many species, act as the worm's primary [[gas exchange|respiratory]] surfaces. Bundles of bristles, called [[chaeta]]e, project from the parapodia.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 469–525|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, polychaetes vary widely from this generalised pattern, and can display a range of different body forms. The most generalised polychaetes are those that crawl along the bottom, but others have adapted to many different [[ecological niche]]s, including burrowing, swimming, [[pelagic]] life, tube-dwelling or boring, [[commensal]]ism, and [[parasite|parasitism]], requiring various modifications to their body structures.

The head, or [[prostomium]], is relatively well developed, compared with other annelids. It projects forward over the mouth, which therefore lies on the animal's underside. The head normally includes two to four pair of eyes, although some species are blind. These are typically fairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing only light and dark, although some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of more sophisticated vision.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The head also includes a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], tentacle-like [[palp]]s, and a pair of pits lined with [[cilia]], known as &quot;nuchal organs&quot;. These latter appear to be [[chemoreceptor]]s, and help the worm to seek out food.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

===Internal anatomy and physiology===
[[File:Polychaeta anatomy en.svg|thumb|400px|right| {{center|General anatomy of a polychaete}}]]
[[File:Phyllodoce rosea.jpg|thumb| {{center|''Phyllodoce rosea''}}]]

The outer surface of the body wall consists of a simple [[columnar epithelium]] covered by a thin [[cuticle]]. Underneath this, in order, are a thin layer of connective tissue, a layer of circular muscle, a layer of longitudinal muscle, and a [[peritoneum]] surrounding the [[coelom|body cavity]]. Additional oblique muscles move the parapodia. In most species the body cavity is divided into separate compartments by sheets of peritoneum between each segment, but in some species it's more continuous.

The mouth of polychaetes is located on the [[peristomium]], the segment behind the [[prostomium]], and varies in form depending on their diets, since the group includes predators, herbivores, filter feeders, scavengers, and parasites. In general, however, they possess a pair of jaws and a [[pharynx]] that can be rapidly everted, allowing the worms to grab food and pull it into their mouths. In some species, the pharynx is modified into a lengthy [[proboscis]]. The digestive tract is a simple tube, usually with a stomach part way along.

The smallest species, and those adapted to burrowing, lack [[gill]]s, breathing only through their body surfaces. Most other species have external gills, often associated with the parapodia.

A simple but well-developed circulatory system is usually present. The two main blood vessels furnish smaller vessels to supply the parapodia and the gut. Blood flows forward in the dorsal vessel, above the gut, and returns down the body in the ventral vessel, beneath the gut. The blood vessels themselves are contractile, helping to push the blood along, so most species have no need of a heart. In a few cases, however, muscular pumps analogous to a heart are found in various parts of the system. Conversely, some species have little or no circulatory system at all, transporting oxygen in the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] that fills their body cavities.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The blood may be colourless, or have any of three different respiratory pigments. The most common of these is [[haemoglobin]], but some groups have [[haemerythrin]] or the green-coloured [[chlorocruorin]], instead.

The nervous system consists of a single or double ventral nerve cord running the length of the body, with [[ganglion|ganglia]] and a series of small nerves in each segment. The brain is relatively large, compared with that of other annelids, and lies in the upper part of the head. An [[endocrine gland]] is attached to the ventral posterior surface of the brain, and appears to be involved in reproductive activity. In addition to the sensory organs on the head, photosensitive eye spots, [[statocyst]]s, and numerous additional sensory nerve endings, most likely in involved with the sense of touch, also occur on the body.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

Polychaetes have a varying number of [[protonephridia]] or [[metanephridia]] for excreting waste, which in some cases can be relatively complex in structure. The body also contains greenish &quot;chloragogen&quot; tissue, similar to that found in [[oligochaete]]s, which appears to function in metabolism, in a similar fashion to that of the vertebrate [[liver]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

Polychaetes are extremely variable in both form and lifestyle, and include a few taxa that swim among the [[plankton]] or above the [[abyssal plain]]. Most burrow or build tubes in the sediment, and some live as [[commensal]]s.  A few are parasitic.  The mobile forms (Errantia) tend to have well-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms (Sedentaria) lack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding, e.g., [[fanworm]]s.
Underwater polychaetes have eversible mouthparts used to capture prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mesa.edu.au/friends/seashores/e_complanata.html |title=Bristleworm |work=MESA}}{{self-published source|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=July 2019}} A few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, like [[Namanereidinae]] with many terrestrial species, but are restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved cutaneous invaginations for aerial gas exchange.

;Notable polychaetes
* One notable polychaete, the [[Pompeii worm]] (''Alvinella pompejana'') is endemic to the [[hydrothermal vent]]s of the Pacific Ocean. Pompeii worms are among the most heat-tolerant complex animals known.
* A recently discovered genus, ''[[Osedax]]'', includes a species nicknamed the &quot;bone-eating snot flower&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCNews_Science&amp;Environment_18Oct2005_Osedaxspp&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4354286.stm|title='Zombie worms' found off Sweden |date=18 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another remarkable polychaete is ''[[Hesiocaeca methanicola]]'', which lives on [[methane clathrate]] deposits.
* ''[[Lamellibrachia]] luymesi'' is a [[cold seep]] [[tube worm (body plan)|tube worm]] that reaches lengths of over 3 m and may be the most long-lived animal, being over 250 years old.
* A still unclassified multilegged predatory polychaete worm was identified only by observation from the underwater vehicle [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''Nereus'']] at the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], the greatest depth in the oceans, near 10,902 m (35,768&amp;nbsp;ft) in depth. It was about an inch long visually, but the probe failed to capture it, so it could not be studied in detail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Accessed Oct. 8, 2009] Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Bobbit worm (''[[Eunice aphroditois]]'') is a predatory species that can achieve a length at {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}), with an average diameter of {{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.

==Reproduction==
Most polychaetes have separate sexes, rather than being hermaphroditic. The most primitive species have a pair of [[gonad]]s in every segment, but most species exhibit some degree of specialisation. The gonads shed immature [[gamete]]s directly into the body cavity, where they complete their development. Once mature, the gametes are shed into the surrounding water through ducts or openings that vary between species, or in some cases by the complete rupture of the body wall (and subsequent death of the adult). A few species [[animal sexual behavior|copulate]], but most fertilize their eggs externally.

The fertilized eggs typically hatch into [[trochophore]] larvae, which float among the [[plankton]], and eventually [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into the adult form by adding segments. A few species have no larval form, with the egg hatching into a form resembling the adult, and in many that do have larvae, the trochophore never feeds, surviving off the yolk that remains from the egg.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

However, some polychaetes exhibit remarkable reproductive strategies. Some species reproduce by [[epitoky]]. For much of the year, these worms look like any other burrow-dwelling polychaete, but as the breeding season approaches, the worm undergoes a remarkable transformation as new, specialized segments begin to grow from its rear end until the worm can be clearly divided into two halves. The front half, the atoke, is asexual. The new rear half, responsible for breeding, is known as the epitoke. Each of the epitoke segments is packed with eggs and sperm and features a single eyespot on its surface. The beginning of the last lunar quarter is the cue for these animals to breed, and the epitokes break free from the atokes and float to the surface. The eye spots sense when the epitoke reaches the surface and the segments from millions of worms burst, releasing their eggs and sperm into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Ross Piper |last=Piper |first=Ross |year=2007 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |url=https://archive.org/details/extraordinaryani0000pipe |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar strategy is employed by the deep sea worm ''[[Syllis ramosa]]'', which lives inside a [[sponge]]. The rear end of the worm develops into a &quot;stolon&quot; containing the eggs or sperm; this stolon then becomes detached from the parent worm and rises to the sea surface, where fertilisation takes place.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/14-fun-facts-about-marine-bristle-worms-180955773/ |title=Some polychaetes have sex lives out of a science fiction movie |last1=Frost |first1=Emily |last2=Waters |first2=Hannah |date=1 July 2015 |work=14 fun facts about marine bristle worms |publisher=Smithsonian.com |access-date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil record==
[[Crown group#Stem groups|Stem-group]] polychaete fossils are known from the [[Sirius Passet]] [[Lagerstätte]], a rich, sedimentary deposit in Greenland tentatively dated to the late [[Atdabanian]] (early [[Cambrian]]).

Being [[soft-bodied organisms]], the fossil record of polychaetes is dominated by their fossilized jaws, known as [[scolecodont]]s, and the [[mineral]]ized tubes that some of them secrete.&lt;ref name=&quot;VinnMutvei2009tubeworms&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vinn |first1=O |last2=Mutvei |first2=H |title=Calcareous tubeworms of the Phanerozoic |journal=Estonian Journal of Earth Sciences |date=2009 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=286 |doi=10.3176/earth.2009.4.07 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most important [[biomineralising polychaetes]] are [[Serpulidae|serpulids]], [[Sabellidae|sabellids]], and [[Cirratulidae|cirratulids]].

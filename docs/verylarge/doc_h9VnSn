==Linguistic development of the Ukrainian language==

===Theories concerning the development of the Ukrainian language===
The first theory of the origin of Ukrainian language was suggested in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the middle of the 18th century by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. This theory posits the existence of a common language spoken by all [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic people]] in the time of the Rus'. According to Lomonosov, the differences that subsequently developed between [[Great Russian language|Great Russian]] and Ukrainian (which he referred to as [[Little Russia]]n) could be explained by the influence of the Polish and Slovak languages on Ukrainian and the influence of [[Uralic languages]] on Russian from the 13th to the 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/lomonos/texts/lo0/lo7/lo7-0812.htm Ломоносов М. В. Полное собрание сочинений. — Т. VII. Труды по филологии 1739-1758 гг. - М.; Л., 1952. — С. 83.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another point of view developed during the 19th and 20th centuries by [[linguists]] of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Like Lomonosov, they assumed the existence of a common language spoken by East Slavs in the past. But unlike Lomonosov's hypothesis, this theory does not view &quot;[[Polonization]]&quot; or any other external influence as the main driving force that led to the formation of three different languages (Russian, Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) from the common [[Old East Slavic language]]. The supporters of this theory disagree, however, about the time when the different languages were formed.

Soviet scholars set the divergence between Ukrainian and Russian only at later time periods (14th through 16th centuries). According to this view, Old East Slavic diverged into Belarusian and Ukrainian to the west (collectively, the Ruthenian language of the 15th to 18th centuries), and [[Old Russian]] to the north-east, after the political boundaries of the [[Kyivan Rus']] were redrawn in the 14th century.

Some researchers, while admitting the differences between the dialects spoken by East Slavic tribes in the 10th and 11th centuries, still consider them as &quot;regional manifestations of a common language&quot; (see, for instance, the article by [[Vasyl Nimchuk]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nimchuk, Vasyl'. Періодизація як напрямок дослідження генези та історії української мови. Мовознавство. 1997.- Ч.6.-С.3–14; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Ahatanhel Krymsky]] and [[Alexei Shakhmatov]] assumed the existence of the common spoken language of Eastern Slavs only in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/pivtorak/pivt.htm |title=Григорій Півторак. Походження українців, росіян, білорусів та їхніх мов |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their point of view, the diversification of the Old East Slavic language took place in the 8th or early 9th century.

Latest research suggests that Russian diverged from Ukrainian and Belorusian in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kassian, Alexei, Anna Dybo, «Supplementary Information 2: Linguistics: Datasets; Methods; Results» in: {{cite journal|last1=Kushniarevich|first1=A|last2=Utevska|first2=O|last3=Chuhryaeva|first3=M|last4=Agdzhoyan|first4=A|last5=Dibirova|first5=K|last6=Uktveryte|first6=I|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal Data|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|year=2015|pages=e0135820|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135820|pmid=26332464|pmc=4558026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the above research did not take into account findings by Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak who stated that in the 11th century Novgorod language differed from Kyiv language (as well as other Slavic languages) much more than in later centuries, meaning that there was no common [[Old East Slavic]] language of Kyivan Rus' from which Ukrainian and Russian languages diverged, but that Russian language developed as convergence of Novgorod language and other Russian dialects, whereas Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belorusian]] were continuation of respective Kyiv and Polotsk dialects of Kyivan Rus'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Some Ukrainian features{{Which|date=September 2016}} were recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic as far back as the language can be documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shevelov, George Y.|date=1979|title=A historical phonology of the Ukrainian language|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/historical-phonology-of-the-ukrainian-language/oclc/5038718?page=citation|access-date=2020-08-02|website=www.worldcat.org|oclc=5038718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian linguist [[Stepan Smal-Stotsky]] denies the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/istkult/ikult01.htm |title=Мова (В.В.Німчук). 1. Історія української культури |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar points of view were shared by [[Yevhen Tymchenko]], [[Vsevolod Hantsov]], [[Olena Kurylo]], [[Ivan Ohienko]] and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today's Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by [[George Shevelov]]'s phonological studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=1979|title=Юрій Шевельов.

===Origins and developments during medieval times===
As a result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] population north of the [[Black Sea]], lasting into the early [[Middle Ages]], the appearance of the voiced fricative γ(h) in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in [[Scythian language|Scythian]] and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*g'' and ''*gʰ''.&lt;ref&gt;Абаев В. И. О происхождении фонемы ''g (h)'' в славянском языке // Проблемы индоевропейского языкознания. М., 1964. С. 115—121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Майоров А.В.

During the 13th century, when German settlers were invited to Ukraine by the princes of Galicia-Vollhynia, German words began to appear in the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under [[Poland]] not only through German colonists but also through the [[Yiddish|Yiddish-speaking]] Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include ''dakh'' (roof), ''rura'' (pipe), ''rynok'' (market), ''kushnir'' (furrier), and ''majster'' (master or craftsman).&lt;ref name = &quot;Concise Middle&quot;&gt;History of the Ukrainian Language. R. Smal-Stocky. In ''Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia.''(1963). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 490–500&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments under Poland and Lithuania===
In the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus' (including Moscow) came under [[Tatar yoke]] until their unification under the Tsardom of [[Muscovy]], whereas the south-western areas (including [[Kyiv]]) were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. For the following four centuries, the language of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/zyzlex/zyz.htm |title=Лаврентій Зизаній. &quot;Лексис&quot;. Синоніма славеноросская |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |access-date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, a peculiar official language was formed: a mixture of  the liturgical standardised language of [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], with the influence of the last of these three gradually increasing, considering that the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the [[Szlachta|szlachta]], was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.&lt;ref name=KostOstr&gt;{{in lang|ru}} [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''Russian History in Biographies of its main figures'', Chapter ''[http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky]'' ([[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish rule and education]] also involved significant exposure to the [[Latin]] language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include ''zavzhdy'' (always; taken from old Polish word ''zawżdy'') and ''obitsiaty'' (to promise; taken from Polish ''obiecać'') and from Latin (via Polish) ''raptom'' (suddenly) and ''meta'' (aim or goal).&lt;ref name=&quot;Concise Middle&quot; /&gt;

Significant contact with [[Tatars]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] resulted in many [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language.  Examples include ''torba'' (bag) and ''tyutyun'' (tobacco).&lt;ref name=&quot;Concise Middle&quot; /&gt;

Due to heavy borrowings from Polish, German, Czech and Latin, early modern vernacular Ukrainian (''prosta mova'', &quot;[[simple speech]]&quot;) had more lexical similarity with [[West Slavic languages]] than with Russian or Church Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Hrytsak. &quot;On Sails and Gales, and Ships Driving in Various Directions: Post-Soviet Ukraine as a Test Case for the Meso-Area Concept&quot;.  In: Kimitaka Matsuzato ed. ''Emerging meso-areas in the former socialist countries: histories revived or improvised?''. Slavic Research Center, [[Hokkaido University]]. 2005. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-17th century, the linguistic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages was so acute that there was a need for translators during negotiations for the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], between [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], head of the [[Zaporozhian Host]], and the Russian state.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Chirovsky.

===Rus' and Kingdom of Russia===
During the [[Khazar]] period, the territory of Ukraine was settled by Iranian (post-[[Scythian]]), Turkic (post-Hunnic, proto-Bulgarian), and Uralic (proto-Hungarian) tribes and Slavic tribes. Finally, the [[Varangian]] ruler of [[Novgorod]], called [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], seized Kyiv and established the political entity of [[Kyivan Rus']]. 

The era of Kyivan Rus' is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily [[Old Slavonic language|Old Slavonic]]. Literary records from Kyivan Rus' testify to substantial difference between [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (Rusyn) form of the Ukrainian language as early as Kyivan Rus' time.

Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (Rusyn); others term this era [[Old East Slavic]]. Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian. However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak, Novgorod people did not call themselves Rus' until the 14th century, calling Rus' only [[Principality of Kiev|Kyiv]], [[Principality of Pereyaslavl|Pereiaslav]] and [[Principality of Chernigov|Chernihiv]] principalities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kyivan Rus' state existed till 1240). At the same time as evidenced by the contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes of [[Kingdom of Russia]] and Kyiv called themselves &quot;People of Rus'&quot; - [[Ruthenians]] (Rusyny), and [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Galicia–Volhynia]] was called Kingdom of Rus.

Also according to Andrey Zaliznyak, in the 11th century Novgorod language differed from Kyivan language (as well as other Slavic languages) much more that later, meaning that there was no common [[Old East Slavic]] language of Kyivan Rus' from which Ukrainian and Russian languages diverged (as Soviet linguistics stated), but that Russian language developed as convergence of Novgorod language and South Russian dialects, whereas Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belorusian]] were continuation of respective Kyiv and Polotsk dialects of Kyivan Rus'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

(Another reason for difference in Russian and Ukrainian languages is that after Kyivan Rus' period Russian language appropriated the Old Slavonic lexic on much larger scale while Ukrainian (and Belorusian) had more Polish and other Western languages influence)

After the fall of [[Galicia–Volhynia]], Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Poland]]. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language. Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy. By the 1569 [[Union of Lublin]] that formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural [[Polonization]] and visible attempts to [[colonization|colonize]] Ukraine by the Polish nobility. Many Ukrainian nobles learned the Polish language and adopted Catholicism during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |title=The Polonization of the Ukrainian Nobility |publisher=Mywebpages.comcast.net |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602145938/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |archive-date=2002-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower classes were less affected because literacy was common only in the upper class and clergy. The latter were also under significant Polish pressure after the [[Union of Brest|Union with the Catholic Church]]. Most of the educational system was gradually Polonized. In Ruthenia, the language of administrative documents gradually shifted towards Polish.

The [[Polish language]] has had heavy influences on Ukrainian (particularly in [[Western Ukraine]]). The southwestern Ukrainian dialects are [[Dialect continuum|transitional]] to Polish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Hull, Halyna Koscharsky. &quot;[http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/20:1-2/lexical-divide-ukrainian.pdf  Contours and Consequences of the Lexical Divide in Ukrainian]&quot;. ''Australian Slavonic and East European Studies''. Vol. 20, no. 1-2. 2006.  pp. 140–147.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ukrainian language developed further, some borrowings from [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] occurred. Ukrainian culture and language flourished in the sixteenth and first half of the 17th century, when Ukraine was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among many schools established in that time, the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium (the predecessor of the modern [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]), founded by the Ruthenian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Peter Mohyla]], was the most important. At that time languages were associated more with religions: Catholics spoke [[Polish language|Polish]], and members of the Orthodox church spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].

After the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], Ukrainian high culture went into a long period of steady decline. In the aftermath, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] and closed down later in the 19th century. Most of the remaining Ukrainian schools also switched to Polish or Russian in the territories controlled by these respective countries, which was followed by a new wave of [[Polonization]] and [[Russification]] of the native nobility. Gradually the official language of Ukrainian provinces under Poland was changed to Polish, while the upper classes in the Russian part of Ukraine used Russian.

During the 19th century, a revival of Ukrainian self-identification manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire [[Dnieper Ukraine]] and Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in Kiyv applied an old word for the Cossack motherland, ''Ukrajina'', as a self-appellation for the nation of Ukrainians, and ''Ukrajins'ka mova'' for the language. Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian was not merely a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.

However, in the Russian Empire expressions of Ukrainian culture and especially language were repeatedly persecuted for fear that a self-aware Ukrainian nation would threaten the unity of the empire. In 1804 Ukrainian as a subject and language of instruction was banned from schools.&lt;ref name=schools/&gt; In 1811 by the Order of the Russian government, the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] was closed. The Academy had been open since 1632 and was the first university in Eastern Europe. In 1847 the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] was terminated. The same year [[Taras Shevchenko]] was arrested, exiled for ten years, and banned for political reasons from writing and painting. In 1862 [[Pavlo Chubynsky]] was exiled for seven years to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The Ukrainian magazine ''[[Osnova]]'' was discontinued. In 1863, the tsarist interior minister [[Pyotr Valuyev]] proclaimed in [[Valuyevsky Ukaz|his decree]] that &quot;there never has been, is not, and never can be a separate Little Russian language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:ru:Валуевский циркуляр|Валуевский циркуляр]], full text of the Valuyev circular on [[Wikisource]] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; A following ban on Ukrainian books led to [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s secret [[Ems Ukaz]], which prohibited publication and importation of most Ukrainian-language books, public performances and lectures, and even banned the printing of Ukrainian texts accompanying musical scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/ohukr/ohu14.htm |title=XII.

For much of the 19th century the Austrian authorities demonstrated some preference for Polish culture, but the Ukrainians were relatively free to partake in their own cultural pursuits in [[Halychyna]] and [[Bukovyna]], where Ukrainian was widely used in education and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/subtelny/istukr/17.htm#6 Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression by Russia retarded the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, but there was a constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.

By the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Austro-Hungary#Dissolution of the Empire|collapse of Austro-Hungary]] in 1918, the former 'Ruthenians' or 'Little Russians' were ready to openly develop a body of national literature, institute a Ukrainian-language educational system, and form an independent state named Ukraine (the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], shortly joined by the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]). During this brief independent statehood the stature and use of Ukrainian greatly improved.&lt;ref name=UkrGrammar30/&gt;

====Speakers in the Russian Empire====
[[File:Ukrainian in Russian Empire 1897.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Ukrainian speakers in the Russian Empire (1897)]]
In the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language (''Русскій'') was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, '[[Little Russian]]'), what we known as Russian today (Великорусскій, '[[Great Russian]]'), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, 'White Russian').

The following table shows the distribution of settlement by native language (''&quot;по родному языку&quot;'') in 1897 in [[Russian Empire]] governorates (''[[guberniya]]s'') that had more than 100,000 Ukrainian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php |title=Демоскоп Weekly – Приложение.

Although in the rural regions of the Ukrainian provinces, 80% of the inhabitants said that Ukrainian was their native language in the Census of 1897 (for which the results are given above), in the urban regions only 32.5% of the population claimed Ukrainian as their native language. For example, in [[Odessa]] (then part of the Russian Empire), at the time the largest city in the territory of current Ukraine, only 5.6% of the population said Ukrainian was their native language.&lt;ref name=George&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2oqThmrFCfwC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Nikolayev+Ukrainian+language&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Soviet Nationality Policy, Urban Growth, and Identity Change in the Ukrainian SSR 1923–1934] by George O. Liber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-521-41391-6}} (page 12/13)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1920s the urban population in Ukraine grew faster than the number of Ukrainian speakers. This implies that there was a (relative) decline in the use of Ukrainian language. For example, in [[Kyiv]], the number of people stating that Ukrainian was their native language declined from 30.3% in 1874 to 16.6% in 1917.&lt;ref name=George/&gt;

===Soviet era===
[[File:Soviet UA class union.gif|upright=1.15|thumb|The Ukrainian text in this Soviet poster reads: &quot;The Social base of the [[USSR]] is an unbreakable union of the workers, peasants and [[intelligentsia]]&quot;.]]

During the seven-decade-long [[Soviet era]], the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Ukraine], [[Life (magazine)|Life]], 26 October 1946&lt;/ref&gt; However, practice was often a different story:&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to discouragement.

Officially, there was no [[state language]] in the Soviet Union until the very end when it was proclaimed in 1990 that Russian language was the all-Union state language and that the constituent [[Soviet republics|republics]] had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |title=Law on Languages of Nations of USSR |publisher=Legal-ussr.narod.ru |date=1990-04-24 |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |archive-date=2016-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still it was implicitly understood in the hopes of minority nations that Ukrainian would be used in the Ukrainian SSR, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] would be used in the [[Uzbek SSR]], and so on. However, Russian was used in all parts of the Soviet Union and a special term, &quot;a language of inter-ethnic communication&quot;, was coined to denote its status.

Soviet language policy in Ukraine may be divided into the following policy periods:

* [[Ukrainianization]] and tolerance (1921–1932)
* Persecution and Russification (1933–1957)
* [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] thaw (1958–1962)
* The [[Shelest]] period: limited progress (1963–1972)
* The [[Shcherbytsky]] period: gradual suppression (1973–1989)
* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[perestroika]] (1990–1991)

====Ukrainianization====
Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Russian Empire was broken up. In different parts of the former empire, several nations, including Ukrainians, developed a renewed sense of [[national identity]]. In the chaotic post-revolutionary years the Ukrainian language gained some usage in government affairs. Initially, this trend continued under the [[Bolshevik]] government of the Soviet Union, which in a political struggle to retain its grip over the territory had to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about many political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire, where it could always find allies.

[[File:Ukposter.jpg|left|thumb|The 1921 Soviet recruitment poster. It uses traditional Ukrainian imagery with Ukrainian-language text: &quot;Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defense of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured.&quot;]]

The widening use of Ukrainian further developed in the first years of Bolshevik rule into a policy called [[korenizatsiya]]. The government pursued a policy of [[Ukrainianization]] by lifting a ban on the Ukrainian language{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}. That led to the introduction of an impressive education program which allowed Ukrainian-taught classes and raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone population. This policy was led by Education Commissar [[Mykola Skrypnyk]] and was directed to approximate the language to [[Russian language|Russian]]{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}. Newly generated academic efforts from the period of independence were co-opted by the Bolshevik government. The party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking but were encouraged to learn the Ukrainian language. Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized&amp;nbsp;– in both population and in education.

The policy even reached those regions of southern [[Russian SFSR]] where the ethnic Ukrainian population was significant, particularly the areas by the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] and especially [[Kuban]] in the [[North Caucasus]]. Ukrainian language teachers, just graduated from expanded institutions of higher education in Soviet Ukraine, were dispatched to these regions to staff newly opened Ukrainian schools or to teach Ukrainian as a second language in Russian schools. A string of local Ukrainian-language publications were started and departments of Ukrainian studies were opened in colleges. Overall, these policies were implemented in thirty-five [[raions]] (administrative districts) in southern [[Russian SFSR|Russia]].

====Persecution and russification====
[[File:UkrSchool.jpeg|right|thumb|Anti-russification protest. The banner reads ''&quot;Ukrainian School for Ukrainian kids!&quot;''.]]

Soviet policy towards the Ukrainian language changed abruptly in late 1932 and early 1933, with the termination of the policy of Ukrainianization.  In December 1932, the regional party cells received a telegram signed by [[V. Molotov]] and Stalin with an order to immediately reverse the Ukrainianization policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The telegram condemned Ukrainianization as ill-considered and harmful and demanded to &quot;immediately halt Ukrainianization in [[raion]]s (districts), switch all Ukrainianized newspapers, books and publications into Russian and prepare by autumn of 1933 for the switching of schools and instruction into Russian&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The following years were characterized by massive repression and discrimination for the Ukrainophones.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Western and most contemporary Ukrainian historians emphasize that the cultural repression was applied earlier and more fiercely in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} and were therefore anti-Ukrainian; others assert that Stalin's goal was the generic crushing of any dissent, rather than targeting the Ukrainians in particular.

Stalinist policies shifted to define Russian as the language of (inter-ethnic) communication. Although Ukrainian continued to be used (in print, education, radio and later television programs), it lost its primary place in advanced learning and republic-wide media. Ukrainian was demoted to a language of secondary importance, often associated with the rise in Ukrainian self-awareness and nationalism and often branded &quot;politically incorrect&quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The new Soviet Constitution adopted in 1936, however, stipulated that teaching in schools should be conducted in native languages.

Major repression started in 1929–30, when a large group of Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] was arrested and most were executed. In Ukrainian history, this group is often referred to as &quot;[[Executed Renaissance]]&quot; (Ukrainian: розстріляне відродження). &quot;Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]&quot; was declared  to be the primary problem in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ukrainian Nationalism in the Post-Stalin Era: Myth, Symbols and Ideology in Soviet Nationalities Policy |last=Farmer |first=K.C. |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terror peaked in 1933, four to five years before the Soviet-wide &quot;[[Great Purge]]&quot;, which, for Ukraine, was a second blow. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were liquidated, as were the &quot;Ukrainianized&quot; and &quot;Ukrainianizing&quot; portions of the Communist party. Soviet Ukraine's autonomy was completely destroyed by the late 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In its place, the glorification of Russia as the first nation to throw off the capitalist yoke had begun,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} accompanied by the migration of Russian workers into parts of Ukraine which were undergoing [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|industrialization]] and mandatory instruction of classic Russian language and literature. Ideologists warned of over-glorifying Ukraine's [[Cossack]] past,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} and supported the closing of Ukrainian cultural institutions and literary publications.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The systematic assault upon Ukrainian identity in culture and education, combined with effects of an artificial famine (''[[Holodomor]]'') upon the peasantry—the backbone of the nation—dealt Ukrainian language and identity a crippling blow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

This sequence of policy change was repeated in [[Western Ukraine]] when it was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In 1939, and again in the late 1940s, a policy of Ukrainianization was implemented. By the early 1950s, Ukrainian was persecuted and a campaign of Russification began.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

====Khrushchev thaw====
[[File:Rouble-1961-Paper-1-Reverse.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|While Russian was a de facto official language of the Soviet Union in all but formal name, all national languages were proclaimed equal. The name and denomination of [[Soviet ruble|Soviet banknotes]] were listed in the languages of all fifteen [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. On this 1961 one-ruble note, the Ukrainian for &quot;one ruble&quot;, один карбованець (''odyn karbovanets`''), directly follows the Russian один рубль (''odin rubl`'').]]

After the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963). The [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s. Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as [[transfer of Crimea]] under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction.

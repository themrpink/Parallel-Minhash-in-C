Many of the characteristic African species—large mammals such as the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, zebra, and antelope and predators such as lions and leopards—do not exist in Madagascar. In addition, the island has been spared the great variety of venomous snakes indigenous to the African continent. Although it is assumed that most life forms on the island had an African (or South American) origin, isolation has allowed old species&amp;mdash;elsewhere extinct&amp;mdash;to survive and new species unique to the island to evolve. Thus, a great number of plant, insect, reptile, and fish species are [[endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar, and all indigenous land mammal species&amp;mdash;66 in all&amp;mdash;are unique to the island.

Madagascar was once covered almost completely by forests, but [[slash and burn]] practices for dry rice cultivation has denuded most of the landscape, especially in the Central Highlands. [[Rain forest]]s are concentrated on the steep hillsides along a slender north-south axis bordering the east coast, from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to Tolagnaro in the south. Secondary growth, which has replaced the original forest and consists to a large extent of [[Ravenala madagascariensis|traveller's trees]], [[raffia palm]], and [[Adansonia|baobab]]s, is found in many places along the east coast and in the north. The vegetation of the Central Highlands and the west coast is for the most part [[savanna]] or [[steppe]], and coarse prairie grass predominates where erosion has not exposed the orange-red lateritic soil. In the southwest, the vegetation is adapted to desert conditions.

The remaining rain forest contains a great number of unique plant species. The country has some 900 species of [[orchid]]. [[Banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[coconut]], [[vanilla]], and other tropical plants grow on the coasts, and the [[eucalyptus]] tree, brought from [[Australia]], is widespread today.

Wood and charcoal from the forests are used to meet 80% of domestic fuel needs. As a result, wood has become scarce. In 1990, the [[World Bank]] launched an environmental program that has increased the planting of pine and eucalyptus to satisfy fuel needs.

==Natural resources==

Madagascar has a number of natural resources, including [[graphite]], [[chromite]], [[coal]], [[bauxite]], rare Earth elements, [[salt]], [[quartz]], [[tar sands]], [[semi-precious]] stones and [[mica]]. There are also fishing areas offshore and potential for [[hydropower]]. 
In 2011, it was estimated that 5.96% of the land area was used for [[arable land]] and 1.02% had permanent crops. Twenty-six percent of the land is forested. 
The majority of the population depends on [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]], largely [[rice]] and [[cattle]]. The manufacturing sector is small but growing.

==Environmental issues==

Madagascar is currently suffering in some areas from soil erosion as a result of [[deforestation]] and overgrazing, [[desertification]], and contamination of surface water with raw sewage and organic waste. Several species of flora and fauna that are unique to the islands are endangered. Regular cyclones cause flooding in low-lying coastal regions.

{{History of Madagascar}}
The '''history of Madagascar''' is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient [[supercontinent]] containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers arriving in [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Sunda Islands|the Sunda islands]] ([[Malay Archipelago]]) between 200 BC and 500 AD. These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of [[Fauna of Madagascar|endemic plant and animal species]], some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the pressures of a growing human population. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Arabs|Arab]], [[South Asia]]n, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[European peoples|European]]. The majority of the [[Demographics of Madagascar|population of Madagascar]] today is a mixture of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[North India]]n, [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Somalis|Somali]] settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ames&quot;&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Ames|first1=Glenn Joseph|last2=Love|first2=Ronald S.|title=Distant Lands and Diverse Cultures: The French Experience in Asia, 1600–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phdWSnCIMwwC|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30864-2}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries of intermarriages created the [[Malagasy people]], who primarily speak [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] with [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Arabic]], French and English influences. Most of the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy, however, reflects an almost equal blend of Austronesian and Bantu, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanger Institute |date=May 4, 2005 |accessdate=April 30, 2006 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |title=The cryptic past of Madagascar: Human inhabitants of Madagascar are genetically unique |url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2005/050504.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303210750/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2005/050504.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other populations often intermixed with the existent population to a more limited degree or have sought to preserve a separate community from the majority Malagasy.

[[File:Urville-Viti-ship.jpg|thumb|An Austronesian [[outrigger canoe]]; Malagasy ''vahoaka'' &quot;people&quot; is from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]] ''*va-waka'' &quot;people of the canoe&quot;. The ''Vahoaka Ntaolo'', the first Austronesian ancestors of the Malagasy, probably used similar canoes to reach the great island from the [[Sunda Islands]]]]
By the [[Middle Ages]], over a dozen predominant ethnic identities had emerged on the island, typified by rule under a local chieftain. Among some communities, such as the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava]], [[Merina people|Merina]] and [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]], leaders seized the opportunity to unite these disparate communities and establish true kingdoms under their rule. These kingdoms increased their wealth and power through exchanges with European, Arab and other seafaring traders, whether they were legitimate vessels or pirates.

Between the 16th and 18th centuries, pirate activity in the coastal areas of [[Madagascar]] was common. The purported free pirate colony of [[Libertatia]] was established on [[Île Sainte-Marie]], originally populated by local Malagasy. The Sakalava and Merina kingdoms in particular exploited European trade to strengthen the power of their kingdoms, trading Malagasy slaves in exchange for European firearms and other goods. Throughout this time, European and Arab seafarers operating in the Indian Ocean traded with coastal communities, and Europeans made several unsuccessful attempts to claim and colonize the island. Beginning in the early 19th century, the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] competed for influence in Madagascar.

By the turn of the 19th century, King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] had reunited the highly populous [[Kingdom of Imerina]], located in the central highlands with its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. His son, [[Radama I]], began to exert its authority over the island's other polities and was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized by a foreign power as the ruler of the greater [[Merina Kingdom]]. Over the 19th century, a series of Merina monarchs engaged in the process of modernization through close diplomatic ties to Britain that led to the establishment of European-style schools, government institutions and infrastructure. [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], introduced by members of the [[London Missionary Society]], was made the state religion under Queen [[Ranavalona II]] and her prime minister, highly influential statesman [[Rainilaiarivony]]. Political wrangling between Britain and France in the 1880s saw Britain recognize France's claim to authority on the island, leading in 1890 to the [[Malagasy Protectorate]], which was unrecognized by the government of Madagascar. The French launched two military campaigns known as the [[Franco-Hova Wars]] to force submission, finally capturing the capital in September 1895. This sparked the widespread [[Menalamba rebellion]] against French rule that was crushed in 1897; the monarchy was held responsible and dissolved, and the queen and her entourage exiled to Reunion and later Algeria, where she died in 1917. Following conquest, the French abolished [[Slavery]] in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 878&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[French Madagascar]], Malagasy were required to fulfill [[corvée]] labor on French-run plantations, which generated high revenues for the colonial administration. Opportunities for Malagasy to access education or skilled positions within the colonial structure were limited, although some basic services like schools and clinics were extended to coastal areas for the first time. The capital city was largely transformed and modernized, and the [[Rova of Antananarivo|royal palaces]] were transformed into a school and later a museum. Although Malagasy were initially prevented from forming political parties, several militant nationalist secret societies emerged, of which the most prominent was [[Vy Vato Sakelika]], founded by [[Ny Avana Ramanantoanina]].

Many Malagasy were conscripted to fight for France in [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], and during the latter Madagascar came under Vichy control before being captured and occupied by the British in the [[Battle of Madagascar]]. At the [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] gave colonies the status of overseas territory and the right to representatives in the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]; when a bill proposed by Malagasy delegates of the [[Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache]] for Madagascar's independence was not passed, militant nationalists led an unsuccessful [[Malagasy uprising]] (1947–1948), during which the French military committed atrocities that deeply scarred the population. The country gained full independence from France in 1960 in the wake of [[decolonization]].

Under the leadership of President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], Madagascar's [[Madagascar#Independent state|First Republic]] (1960–1972) was established as a democratic system modeled on that of France. This period was characterized by continued economic and cultural dependence upon France, provoking resentment and sparking the ''[[rotaka]]'', popular movements among farmers and students that ultimately ushered in the socialist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar]] under Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]] (1975–1992) distinguished by economic isolationism and political alliances with pro-Soviet states. As Madagascar's economy quickly unraveled, standards of living declined dramatically and growing social unrest was increasingly met with violent repression on the part of the Ratsiraka government. By 1992, free and fair multiparty elections were held, ushering in the democratic [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992–2009). Under the new constitution, the Malagasy public elected successive presidents [[Albert Zafy]], Didier Ratsiraka, and [[Marc Ravalomanana]]. This latter was ousted in the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis]] by a popular movement under the leadership of [[Andry Rajoelina]], then-mayor of Antananarivo, in what was widely characterized as a coup d'état. Rajoelina ushered in the Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010 and ruled Madagascar as president of the [[High Transitional Authority]] without recognition from the international community. [[Malagasy general election, 2013|Elections were held]] on December 20, 2013 to elect a new president and return the country to constitutional governance.

=== Archaeological evidence for date of first settlement ===

The earliest unambiguous evidence of human presence in Madagascar was found at Andavakoera and dates to 490 CE.&lt;ref&gt;'The archaeological evidence for the earliest human presence in Madagascar comes from Andavakoera near Diego Suarez and is dated to AD420 (AD250-590, 2SDs) (Dewar &amp; Wright 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for earlier human presence, but it is ambiguous or not widely studied yet. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gommery | first1 = D. | last2 = Ramanivosoa | first2 = B. | last3 = Faure | first3 = M. | last4 = Guérin | first4 = C. | last5 = Kerloc'h | first5 = P. | last6 = Sénégas | first6 = F. | last7 = Randrianantenaina | first7 = H. | title = Oldest evidence of human activities in Madagascar on subfossil hippopotamus bones from Anjohibe (Mahajanga Province) | journal = Comptes Rendus Palevol | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | year = 2011 | pages = 271–278 | doi = 10.1016/j.crpv.2011.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R.

There is potential evidence in the form of a cutmarked subfossil [[lemur]] bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated 530 to 300 BCE (Godfrey &amp; Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artifacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from [[cannabis]] or [[humulus]] pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200 [[Before Present]] (BP).&lt;ref&gt;Burney 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hypothesis that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago.

In 2009, archaeological excavations at Christmas River (south-central Madagascar) by Pat Wright and James Hansford located a purported elephant bird kill site, with bones showing human cut marks. These were dated to 8,500 BCE, but as yet there is no indication as to the identity of the hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zsl.org/science/news/ancient-bird-bones-redate-human-activity-in-madagascar-by-6000-years |title=Ancient bird bones redate human activity in Madagascar by 6,000 years |date=September 10, 2018 |website=Zoological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-09-ancient-bird-bones-redate-human.html |title=Ancient bird bones redate human activity in Madagascar by 6,000 years |date=September 12, 2018 |website=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Necho II]]'s Phoenician expedition c. 595 BCE circumnavigated Africa but did not see Madagascar when passing through the [[Mozambique Channel]], as it stayed within sight of land. The island was likely uninhabited.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley196608&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Ley|first=Willy|date=August 1966|title=Scherazade's Island|url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n06_1966-08#page/n45/mode/2up|department=For Your Information|magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until around 1200.

Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60 BCE and 130 CE (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020 and 3495 BP (MacPhee &amp; Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Forster, Shuichi Matsumutra, Matthieu Vizuete-Forster, Petya Belinda Blumbach &amp; Robert Dewar (2008) &quot;The Genetic Prehistory of Madagascar's Female Asian Lineages&quot;, In: {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Matsumura|first1=Shūichi|last2=Forster|first2=Peter|last3=Renfrew|first3=Colin|authorlink3=Colin Renfrew|title=Simulations, Genetics and Human Prehistory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IR3bAAAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research|isbn=978-1-902937-45-8}}, pp71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Borobudur Ship Expedition in 2003–2004 affirmed scholars' ideas that ships from ancient Indonesia could have reached Madagascar and the west African coast for trade from the 8th century and after. A traditional [[Borobudur ship]] with outriggers was reconstructed and sailed in this expedition from [[Jakarta]] to Madagascar and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pareanom|first=Yusi Avianto|title=Cinnamon Route: The Samudraraksa Borobudur Expedition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=queuAAAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur, Prambanan &amp; Ratu Boko|isbn=978-979-8083-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the ancient route, one possibility is that Indonesian Austronesians came directly across the Indian Ocean from [[Java]] to Madagascar.

The Southeast Asian origin of the first Malagasy people explains certain features common among the Malagasy, for instance, the [[epicanthic fold]] common among all Malagasy whether coastal or highlands, whether pale, dark or copper skinned. This original population (''vahoaka ntaolo'') can be called the &quot;Proto-Malagasy&quot;. They are the source of:
* the Malagasy language, common to the whole island, which shares many common [[root (linguistics)|roots]] with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages of [[Barito languages|Barito]] subgroup, which originated in [[South Kalimantan]], such as [[Ma'anyan language|Ma'anyan]].&lt;ref&gt;O.

* Malagasy cultural traditions shared with Austronesians of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwan]], the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, New Zealand, and the Philippines including ancient customs, such as burying the dead within a canoe in the sea or in a lake, the cultivation of traditional Austronesian crops such as taro or {{lang|mg|saonjo}}, banana, coconut, and sugar cane, traditional architecture with a square house plan, music and musical instruments such as the {{lang|mg|antsiva}} conch, the {{lang|mg|hazolahy}} drum, the {{lang|mg|atranatrana}} xylophone, {{lang|mg|[[sodina]]}} flute, or the {{lang|mg|[[valiha]]}} [[tube zither]],&lt;ref&gt;schmidhoffer, A. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and dance, including the &quot;bird dance&quot; found both in central and southern regions.&lt;ref&gt;This is according to historian Edward Ralaimihoatra, who calls these Austronesians globally the ''Vazimba'', without distinguishing between the coastal Vezo, and the Vazimba of the forest. &quot;[T]he main basis of the Malagasy language and techniques of Austronesian origins such as outrigger canoes, flooded rice fields, squared timber boxes or branches built on stilts, villages in the hills surrounded by ditches, etc. This fund has received contributions resulting from human exchanges between Africa and Madagascar, with navigation between the Arab coast of [[Arabian Peninsula|Saudi]], East Africa, and the Big Island.&quot; Ralaimihoatra E., &quot;The Primitives or Vazimba Malagasy&quot;, in ''History of Madagascar'')&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the cause of the coming of these Austronesians, the history of the Indian Ocean from the early first millennium CE is still poorly understood. One can only assume{{weasel inline|date=October 2020}} that the island of Madagascar played an important role in trade, particularly that of spice trade (especially [[cinnamon]]) and timber between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, directly or through the African coast and Madagascar.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===''Vazimba'' and ''Vezo''===
The first known concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Gwyn |title=The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750–1810 |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=111–148 |year=1993 |doi=10.2307/219188|jstor=219188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, early settlers practiced ''tavy'' ([[slash-and-burn]] agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal [[rainforest]]s for the cultivation of their crops.&lt;ref name = Kent&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Raymond |title=Early Kingdoms in Madagascar: 1500–1700 |publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location = New York |year=1970 |isbn = 9780030841712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including [[Subfossil lemur|giant lemurs]], [[elephant bird]]s, [[Cryptoprocta spelea|giant fossa]] and the [[Malagasy hippopotamus]], which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Virah-Sawmy | first = M. |author2=Willis, K.J. |author3=Gillson, L. | title = Evidence for drought and forest declines during the recent megafaunal extinctions in Madagascar | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 37 | pages = 506–519 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02203.x | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 600, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and began clearing the forests of the central highlands (''Imerina''), where they particularly planted [[taro]] (''saonjo'') and probably rice (''vary''). These ''Vahoaka Ntaolo'', hunters-gatherers and farmers, who decided to settle &quot;in the forest&quot;, especially in the forests of the central highlands are known by the tradition&lt;ref name=&quot;Callet&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Callet |first=François |year=1972 |origyear=1908 |title=Tantara ny andriana eto Madagasikara (histoire des rois) |publisher=Imprimerie catholique |location=Antananarivo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Vazimba]] (from ''*ba/va-yimba-'' 'those of the forest', from ''*yimba-'' 'forest' in Proto–Southeast Barito, today ''barimba'' or ''orang rimba'' in Malay&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Pierre (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFsBYffWD48C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Simon+Pierre+Fitenin-drazana&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P1dvTpXpBc_P4QSR5tCXCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vazimba&amp;f=false ''La langue des ancêtres.

Rafandrana, an ancestor of the [[Merina people|Merina]] royal dynasty, for example, is known to have been a Vazimba. [[Rafohy]] and [[Rangita]], the two founding queens of the Merina royalty, were also called Vazimbas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callet&quot; /&gt;

[[File:TaroAKL.jpg|thumb|The [[taro]] (''saonjo'' in Malagasy) is, according to an old Malagasy proverb, &quot;the elder of the rice&quot; (''Ny saonjo no zokin'ny vary''), and was also a staple diet for the proto-Austronesians]]

On the other side, the fishermen who, from the beginning, remained on the southwestern coast (probably the coasts of the first landing) were, according to the linguists, probably originally called the ''[[Vezo]]'' (from ''*ba/va/be/ve-jau'' – &quot;those of the coast&quot;, borrowed from Proto-Malayo-Javanese, today ''veju'' in Bugis, ''bejau'' in Malay, and ''bajo'' in Javanese&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot; /&gt;), which today is still the name of a Southwestern tribe.

After the arrival of the newcomers (see below), as growing population density necessitated higher crop yields, irrigated rice paddies emerged in [[Betsileo people|Betsileo]] country by 1600 and were complemented with terraced paddies throughout the central highlands a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1993), p.116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zebu]] were introduced around 1000 by [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] migrants from the [[African Great Lakes]] region (see below), who maintained large herds. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the region from a forest ecosystem to barren grassland by the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gade 1996&quot; /&gt;

==Traders, explorers, and immigration (700–1500)==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Template:History of Madagascar]]--&gt;

By the mid-first millennium (ca 700) until about 1500, the inner Vazimbas as much as the coastal Vezos clans welcome new visitors or immigrants. These goods and/or slave traders from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arabized Jews, accompanied by Bantus from southeast Africa), and from Asia (Gujarat Indians, Malays, Javanese, Bugis) were sometimes integrated within the coastal Vezos and the inner Vazimbas clans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Pier M. | year = 2000 | title = History and Memory in the Age of Enslavement.

===Omani Arabs (from the 7th century)===
The written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century when [[Omanis]] established trading posts along the northwest coast and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as the [[sorabe alphabet]]), Arab astrology and other cultural elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Metz |first=Helen Chapin |year=1994 |title=Library of Congress Country Studies: Madagascar (Education) |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+mg0030%29 |accessdate=February 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327073937/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+mg0030%29 |archivedate=March 27, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this early period, Madagascar served as an important transoceanic trading port for the East African coast that gave Africa a trade route to the [[Silk Road]] and served simultaneously as a port for incoming ships. There is evidence that [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] or [[Swahili people|Swahili]] sailors or traders may have begun sailing to the western shores of Madagascar as early as around the 6th and 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Archaeology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Majewski|first1=Teresita|last2=Gaimster|first2=David|title=International Handbook of Historical Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRcFQ_gBNI8C&amp;pg=PA571|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-72071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the traditions of some Malagasy peoples, the first Bantus and Arabs to settle in Madagascar came as [[refugee]]s from the [[Succession to Muhammad|civil wars]] that followed the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sigmund Edland, Tantaran’ny Fiangonana Loterana Malagasy&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the 10th or 11th century, [[Arabic]] and [[Zanzibar]]i [[History of slavery|slavers]] worked their way down the [[Swahili coast]] in their [[dhow]]s and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. Notably they included the Zafiraminia, traditional ancestors of the [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]], [[Antanosy people|Antanosy]] and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants, the Antalaotra, immigrated from Swahili colonies. They settled the northwest of the island (the [[Mahajanga]] area) and introduced, for the first time, [[Islam in Madagascar|Islam to Madagascar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Arab immigrants, though few in number compared to the native Austronesians and Bantus, nevertheless left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins in certain regions come from Arabic origins,&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY OF MADAGASCAR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=HISTORY OF MADAGASCAR|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=ad26|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahle|first=L.|date=1876|title=THE INFLUENCE OF THE ARABS ON THE MALAGASY LANGUAGE|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wFgcAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-wFgcAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|journal=The Antananarvio Annual and Madagascar Magazine|volume=1|pages=75–91|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do cultural features such as the practice of [[circumcision]], the communal grain-pool, and different forms of salutation (such as ''[[As-salamu alaykum|salama]]'').

===Neo-Austronesians: Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut (from the 8th century)===

According to oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Ramilison E.,''Andriantomara-Andriamamilazabe: loharanon'ny andriana nanjaka teto Imerina'', Antananarivo, Lutheran Printing&lt;/ref&gt; new Austronesian clans ([[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis]], and [[orang laut|orang-orang laut]]),&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, KA (2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828022131/http://www.santafe.edu/events/workshops/images/6/6d/IndonesianMigrations.pdf &quot;The Indonesian migrations to Madagascar: Making sense of the multidisciplinary evidence&quot;])&lt;/ref&gt; historically referred to in general, regardless of their native island, as the &quot;[[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Callet&quot; /&gt; (from Old Bugis ''uwa'', &quot;commoner&quot;) landed in the north-west and east coast of the island. Adelaar's observations of Old Malay (Sanskritised), Old Javanese (Sanskritised) and Old Bugis borrowings in the initial Proto-Southeast-Barito language indicate that the first Hova waves came probably in the 7th century at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, “The Indonesian Migrations to Madagascar”, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Marre and Dahl pointed out that the number of Sanskrit words in Malagasy is very limited compared with the large number now found in Indonesian languages, which means that the Indonesian settlers must have come at an early stage of Hindu influence, that is ca. 400 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Otto Chr. ''Malgache et Maanjan: une Comparaison Linguistique'', Egede-Instituttet Avhandlinger, no. 3. Oslo: Egede-Instituttet, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hova were probably derived from Indonesian [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]]. Their leaders were known as the ''diana'' in the Southeast and ''[[andriana]]'' or ''raondriana'' in the Center and the West&lt;ref name=&quot;Callet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramilison, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramilison&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramilison |first=Emmanuel |year=1951 |title=Ny loharanon'ny andriana nanjaka teto Imerina : Andriantomara-Andriamamilazabe |publisher=Imprimerie Ankehitriny}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from ''(ra)-hadi-an'', &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot; in Old Javanese,&lt;ref name=&quot;Adelaar&quot; /&gt; modern Javanese [[Priyayi#Titles|''raden'']], also found in the Bugis noble title [[:fr:Titres de noblesse indonésiens#Bugis|''andi'']] and the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for &quot;king&quot; ''hari'').

* In the Northwest area of the current Ankoala (from ''kuala'', &quot;estuary&quot; in Malay and Indonesian) where the Hova ''Orang Laut'' (''Antalaotra'' in Malagasy) had probably established their base for their Indian Ocean operations.
* On the east coast (Betsimisaraka) where the Hova leaders were also called ''Filo (ha) be'' by the &quot;neo-Vezo&quot; clans.
* In the southeast where the leaders (&quot;Diana&quot;) of the Zafiraminia and Zafikazimambo clans allied with the &quot;neo-Vezo&quot; and founded the later Antaisaka, Antaimoro and Antambahoaka kingdoms.
* In the west: the Maroserana dynasty which founded the Sakalava Kingdom is itself a result of Zafiraminia on the east coast.
* In the Center where repeated alliances among the Hova leaders (the ''andriana'') (such as Andrianerinerina, Andriantomara and their descendants&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramilison&quot; /&gt;) with the chiefs of Vazimba clans (such as Rafandrana and his descendants&lt;ref&gt;Callet, F., op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;) led to the Merina and Betsileo Kingdoms.

With the arrival of Islam, Persian and Arab traders soon supplanted the Indonesians on the coast of Africa and eventually extended their control over the [[Comoro Islands]] and parts of the coast of Madagascar. Meanwhile, with competition in the new joint naval powers of [[Song dynasty|Song China]] and [[Chola dynasty|Chola South India]], the thalassocracies of Indonesia were in rapid decline, though the Portuguese still encountered Javanese sailors in Madagascar in the {{formatnum: sixteenth century}}.

{{Campaignbox Fredericksburg Campaign}}

The '''Battle of Fredericksburg''' was fought December 11–15, 1862, in and around [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]]. The combat, between the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]] commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ambrose E. Burnside]] and the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#General|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]], included futile frontal attacks by the Union Army on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city. It is remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war, with Union casualties more than twice as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates. A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] as a &quot;butchery&quot;.

Burnside's plan was to cross the [[Rappahannock River]] at Fredericksburg in mid-November and race to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] before Lee's army could stop him. Bureaucratic delays prevented Burnside from receiving the necessary [[pontoon bridge]]s in time and Lee moved his army to block the crossings. When the Union army was finally able to build its bridges and cross under fire, [[urban warfare|direct combat]] within the city resulted on December 11–12. Union troops prepared to assault Confederate defensive positions south of the city and on a strongly fortified ridge just west of the city known as Marye's Heights.

On December 13, the Left Grand Division of Maj. Gen. [[William B. Franklin]] was able to pierce the first defensive line of Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Stonewall Jackson]] to the south, but was finally repulsed. Burnside ordered the Right and Center Grand Divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Edwin Vose Sumner|Edwin V. Sumner]] and [[Joseph Hooker]] to launch multiple frontal assaults against Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s position on Marye's Heights – all were repulsed with heavy losses. On December 15, Burnside withdrew his army, ending another failed Union campaign in the Eastern Theater.

==Background==
===Military situation===
[[File:ATLAS OR VIRGINIA MAP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Virginia, 1862]]
{{further|Peninsula Campaign|Seven Days Battles|Northern Virginia campaign|Maryland campaign|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}

In November 1862, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] needed to demonstrate the success of the [[Union Army|Union war effort]] before the Northern public lost confidence in his administration. [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]] had been on the move earlier in the fall, invading [[Battle of Perryville#Kentucky campaign of 1862|Kentucky]] and [[Maryland campaign|Maryland]]. Although each had been turned back, those armies remained intact and capable of further action. Lincoln urged [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to advance against the Confederate stronghold of [[Vicksburg campaign|Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. He replaced Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] with Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]], hoping for a more aggressive posture against the Confederates in Tennessee, and on November 5, seeing that his replacement of Buell had not stimulated Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] into action, he issued orders to replace McClellan in command of the [[Army of the Potomac]] in Virginia. McClellan had stopped [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#General|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in Maryland, but had not been able to destroy Lee's army, nor did he pursue Lee back into Virginia aggressively enough for Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

McClellan's replacement was Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose E. Burnside]], the commander of the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]]. Burnside had established a reputation as an independent commander, with successful operations earlier that year in [[Burnside's North Carolina Expedition|coastal North Carolina]] and, unlike McClellan, had no apparent political ambitions. However, he felt himself unqualified for army-level command and objected when offered the position. He accepted only when it was made clear to him that McClellan would be replaced in any event and that an alternative choice for command was Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], whom Burnside disliked and distrusted. Burnside assumed command on November 7.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, text to map 71; Marvel, pp. 159–61; O'Reilly, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burnside's plan===
[[File:WPMA00 FREDERICKSBURG.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Fredericksburg campaign, situation November 19, 1862 and movements since October 10]]

In response to prodding from Lincoln and general-in-chief Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], Burnside planned a late fall offensive; he communicated his plan to Halleck on November 9. The plan relied on quick movement and deception. He would concentrate his army in a visible fashion near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]], feigning a movement on [[Culpeper Court House, Virginia|Culpeper Court House]], [[Orange, Virginia|Orange Court House]] or [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]]. He would then rapidly shift his army southeast and cross the [[Rappahannock River]] to Fredericksburg, hoping that Lee would not move, unclear as to Burnside's intentions, while the Union Army made a rapid movement against Richmond, south along the [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]] (RF&amp;P) from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. Burnside selected this plan because he was concerned that if he were to move directly south from Warrenton, he would be exposed to a [[flanking maneuver|flanking attack]] from [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]], whose corps was at that time in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] south of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]. He also believed that the [[Orange and Alexandria Railroad]] (O&amp;A) would be an inadequate supply line. (Burnside was also influenced by plans McClellan began developing just prior to being relieved. Aware that Lee had blocked the O&amp;A, McClellan considered a route through Fredericksburg and ordered a small group of cavalrymen commanded by [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Ulric Dahlgren]] to investigate the condition of the RF&amp;P.) While Burnside began assembling a supply base at [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]], near Fredericksburg, the Lincoln administration undertook a lengthy debate about the wisdom of his plan, which differed from the president's preference of a movement south on the O&amp;A and a direct confrontation with Lee's army instead of the movement focused on the city of Richmond. Lincoln reluctantly approved the plan on November 14 but cautioned his general to move with great speed, certainly doubting that Lee would react as Burnside anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 396; O'Reilly,– pp. 14–23; Welcher, p. 700; Marvel, pp. 164–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to battle===
[[File:Fredericksburg Campaign initial movements.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Initial movements in the Fredericksburg campaign
{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}
{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}]]

The Union Army began marching on November 15, and the first elements arrived in Falmouth on November 17. Burnside's plan quickly went awry—he had ordered [[pontoon bridges]] to be sent to the front and assembled for his quick crossing of the Rappahannock, but because of administrative bungling, the bridges did not arrive on time. Burnside first requisitioned the pontoon bridging (along with many other provisions) on November 7 when he detailed his plan to Halleck. The plan was sent to the attention of Brig. Gen. [[George Washington Cullum]], the chief of staff in Washington (received on November 9). Plans called for both riverine and overland movement of the pontoon trains to Falmouth. On November 14, the 50th New York Engineers reported the pontoons were ready to move, except for a lack of the 270 horses needed to move them. Unknown to Burnside, most of the bridging was still on the upper Potomac. Communications between Burnside's staff engineer [[Cyrus B. Comstock]] and the Engineer Brigade commander [[Daniel P. Woodbury]] indicate that Burnside had assumed the bridging was en route to Washington based on orders given on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Records of the American Civil War|''Official Records'']], Series I, Vol. XIX, Part II, p. 552–81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skinker's Neck Alfred Waud.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Skinkers Neck on the Rappanhannock below Fredericksburg, VA'', 1862 sketch by [[Alfred Waud]]]]
As Maj. Gen. [[Edwin Vose Sumner|Edwin V. Sumner]] arrived, he strongly urged an immediate crossing of the river to scatter the token Confederate force of 500 men in the town and occupying the commanding heights to the west. Burnside became anxious, concerned that the increasing autumn rains would make the fording points unusable and that Sumner might be cut off and destroyed, ordering Sumner to wait in Falmouth.&lt;ref&gt;Rable, pp. 81–82; O'Reilly, pp. 25–32; Eicher, p. 397; Welcher, p. 700; Kennedy, p. 145; Salmon, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee at first anticipated that Burnside would beat him across the Rappahannock and that to protect Richmond, he would assume the next defensible position to the south, the [[North Anna River]]. But when he saw how slowly Burnside was moving (and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] expressed reservations about planning for a battle so close to Richmond), he directed all of his army toward Fredericksburg. By November 23, the corps commanded by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] had arrived and Lee placed them on the ridge known as Marye's Heights to the west of town, with Anderson's division on the far left, McLaws's directly behind the town, and Pickett's and Hood's to the right. He sent for Jackson on November 26, but his Second Corps commander had anticipated the need and began forced-marching his troops from Winchester on November 22, covering as many as 20 miles a day. Jackson arrived at Lee's headquarters on November 29 and his divisions were deployed to prevent Burnside crossing downstream from Fredericksburg: D.H. Hill's division moved to Port Royal, 18 miles down river; Early's 12 miles down river at Skinker's Neck; A.P. Hill's at Thomas Yerby's house, &quot;Belvoir&quot;, about 6 miles southeast of town; and Taliaferro's along the RF&amp;P Railroad, 4 miles south at Guinea Station.&lt;ref&gt;Goolrick, p. 39; O'Reilly, pp. 33–43; Eicher, p. 397; Welcher, pp. 701–702.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats and equipment for a single pontoon bridge arrived at Falmouth on November 25, much too late to enable the Army of the Potomac to cross the river without opposition. Burnside still had an opportunity, however, because by then he was facing only half of Lee's army, not yet dug in, and if he acted quickly, he might have been able to attack Longstreet and defeat him before Jackson arrived. Once again he squandered his opportunity. The full complement of bridges arrived at the end of the month, but by this time Jackson was present and Longstreet was preparing strong defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 398; Center for Military History, p. 1; Marvel. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside originally planned to cross his army east of Fredericksburg at Skinker's Neck, but an advance movement by Federal gunboats to there was fired upon and drew Early's and D.H. Hill's divisions into that area, a movement spotted by Union [[Union Army Balloon Corps|balloon observers]]. Now assuming that Lee had anticipated his plan, Burnside guessed that the Confederates had weakened their left and center to concentrate against him on their right. So he decided to cross directly at Fredericksburg. On December 9, he wrote to Halleck, &quot;I think now the enemy will be more surprised by a crossing immediately in our front than any other part of the river. ... I'm convinced that a large force of the enemy is now concentrated at Port Royal, its left resting on Fredericksburg, which we hope to turn.&quot; In addition to his numerical advantage in troop strength, Burnside also had the advantage of knowing his army could not be attacked effectively. On the other side of the Rappahannock, 220 artillery pieces had been located on the ridge known as Stafford Heights to prevent Lee's army from mounting any major counterattacks.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 51–52; Eicher, p. 398; Goolrick, pp. 39–40; Esposito, map 72; Marvel, pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside organized his '''[[Army of the Potomac]]''' into three so-called ''Grand Divisions'', organizations that included infantry corps, cavalry, and artillery, comprising 120,000 men, of whom 114,000 would be engaged in the coming battle:&lt;ref name=UFS/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USF&quot;/&gt;
* The '''''Right Grand Division''''', commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Edwin Vose Sumner|Edwin V. &quot;Bull&quot; Sumner]], consisted of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] of Maj. Gen. [[Darius N.

Robert E. Lee's '''[[Army of Northern Virginia]]''' had nearly 79,000 men,&lt;ref name=CFS/&gt; with 72,500&lt;ref name=&quot;CSF&quot;/&gt; engaged. His organization of the army in corps was approved by an act of the Confederate Congress on November 6, 1862 and consisted of:
* The [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]] of Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]] included the divisions of Maj. Gens. [[Lafayette McLaws]], [[Richard H. Anderson]], [[George E. Pickett]], and [[John Bell Hood]], and Brig. Gen. [[Robert Ransom, Jr.]]
* The [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]] of Lt. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] included the divisions of Maj. Gens. [[D.H. Hill]] and [[A.P. Hill]], and Brig. Gens. [[Jubal A. Early]] and [[William B. Taliaferro]].
* Reserve Artillery under Brig. Gen. [[William N. Pendleton]].
* The Cavalry Division under Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]].

The two armies at Fredericksburg represented the largest number of armed men that ever confronted each other for combat during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Goolrick, p. 39; O'Reilly, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Union [[combat engineer|engineers]] began to assemble six [[pontoon bridge]]s before dawn on December 11, two just north of the town center, a third on the southern end of town, and three farther south, near the confluence of the Rappahannock and Deep Run. The engineers constructing the bridge directly across from the city came under punishing fire from Confederate [[marksman|sharpshooters]], primarily from the Mississippi brigade of Brig. Gen. [[William Barksdale]], in command of the town defenses. Union artillery attempted to dislodge the sharpshooters, but their positions in the cellars of houses rendered the fire from 150 guns mostly ineffective. Eventually Burnside's artillery commander, Brig. Gen. [[Henry J. Hunt]], convinced him to send infantry landing parties over in the pontoon boats to secure a small [[bridgehead]] and rout the sharpshooters. Col. [[Norman J. Hall]] volunteered his brigade for this assignment. Burnside suddenly turned reluctant, lamenting to Hall in front of his men that &quot;the effort meant death to most of those who should undertake the voyage.&quot; When his men responded to Hall's request with three cheers, Burnside relented. At 3 p.m., the Union artillery began a preparatory bombardment and 135 infantrymen from the 7th Michigan and the 19th Massachusetts crowded into the small boats, and the [[20th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|20th Massachusetts]] followed soon after. They crossed successfully and spread out in a skirmish line to clear the sharpshooters. Although some of the Confederates surrendered, fighting proceeded street by street through the town as the engineers completed the bridges. Sumner's Right Grand Division began crossing at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., but the bulk of his men did not cross until December 12. Hooker's Center Grand Division crossed on December 13, using both the northern and southern bridges.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 67–85; Goolrick, pp. 50–52; Esposito, map 72; Welcher, pp. 703–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clearing of the city buildings by Sumner's infantry and by artillery fire from across the river began the first major [[Urban warfare|urban combat]] of both the war and American history. Union gunners sent more than 5,000 shells against the town and the ridges to the west. By nightfall, four brigades of Union troops occupied the town, which they looted with a fury that had not been seen in the war up to that point. This behavior enraged Lee, who compared their depredations with those of the ancient [[Vandals]]. The destruction also angered the Confederate troops, many of whom were native Virginians. Many on the Union side were also shocked by the destruction inflicted on Fredericksburg. Civilian casualties were unusually low given the widespread violence; George Rable estimates no more than four civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Rable, pp. 166–67, 177–89; O'Reilly, pp. 57–126; Eicher, pp. 398–99; Goolrick, pp. 53–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

River crossings south of the city by Franklin's Left Grand Division were much less eventful. Both bridges were completed by 11 a.m. on December 11 while five batteries of Union artillery suppressed most sniper fire against the engineers. Franklin was ordered at 4 p.m. to cross his entire command, but only a single brigade was sent out before dark. Crossings resumed at dawn and were completed by 1 p.m. on December 12. Early on December 13, Jackson recalled his divisions under Jubal Early and D.H. Hill from down river positions to join his main defensive lines south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 703–704; Center for Military History, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside's verbal instructions on December 12 outlined a main attack by Franklin, supported by Hooker, on the southern flank, while Sumner made a secondary attack on the northern flank. His actual orders on December 13 were vague and confusing to his subordinates. At 5 p.m. on December 12, he made a cursory inspection of the southern flank, where Franklin and his subordinates pressed him to give definite orders for a morning attack by the grand division, so they would have adequate time to position their forces overnight. However, Burnside demurred and the order did not reach Franklin until 7:15 or 7:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. When it arrived, it was not as Franklin expected. Rather than ordering an attack by the entire grand division of almost 60,000 men, Franklin was to keep his men in position, but was to send &quot;a division at least&quot; to seize the high ground (Prospect Hill) around Hamilton's Crossing, Sumner was to send one division through the city and up Telegraph Road, and both flanks were to be prepared to commit their entire commands. Burnside was apparently expecting these weak attacks to intimidate Lee, causing him to withdraw. Franklin, who had originally advocated a vigorous assault, chose to interpret Burnside's order very conservatively. Brig. Gen. [[James Allen Hardie|James A. Hardie]], who delivered the order, did not ensure that Burnside's intentions were understood by Franklin, and map inaccuracies about the road network made those intentions unclear. Furthermore, Burnside's choice of the verb &quot;to seize&quot; was less forceful in 19th century military terminology than an order &quot;to carry&quot; the heights.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, pp. 399–400; Goolrick, pp. 60–61; Marvel, pp. 180–87; Center for Military History, pp. 2–3; Kennedy, p. 145; O'Reilly, p. 137. To &quot;seize&quot; was typically ordered for positions not occupied by a significant enemy force.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South of the city, December 13===
[[File:Fredericksburg-Overview.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Overview of the battle, December 13, 1862]]

December 13 began cold and overcast. A dense fog blanketed the ground and made it impossible for the armies to see each other. Franklin ordered his I Corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]], to select a division for the attack. Reynolds chose his smallest division, about 4,500 men commanded by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], and assigned Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]]'s division to support Meade's attack. His reserve division, under Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]], was to face south and protect the left flank between the Richmond Road and the river. Meade's division began moving out at 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., with Gibbon following behind. At around 10:30, the fog started lifting. They moved parallel to the river initially, turning right to face the Richmond Road, where they began to be struck by enfilading fire from the Virginia Horse Artillery under Major [[John Pelham (officer)|John Pelham]]. Pelham started with two cannons—a [[Field Artillery in the American Civil War#12-pounder Napoleon|12-pounder Napoleon]] smoothbore and a rifled [[Blakely rifle|Blakely]]—but continued with only one after the latter was disabled by counter-battery fire. &quot;Jeb&quot; Stuart sent word to Pelham that he should feel free to withdraw from his dangerous position at any time, to which Pelham responded, &quot;Tell the General I can hold my ground.&quot; The [[Iron Brigade]] (formerly Gibbon's command, but now led by Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]]) was sent out to deal with the Confederate horse artillery. This action was mainly conducted by the [[24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry|24th Michigan Infantry]], a newly enlisted regiment that had joined the brigade in October. After about an hour, Pelham's ammunition began to run low and he withdrew. General Lee observed the action and commented about Pelham, age 24, &quot;It is glorious to see such courage in one so young.&quot; The most prominent victim of Pelham's fire was Brig. Gen. [[George Dashiell Bayard|George D. Bayard]], a cavalry general mortally wounded by a shell while standing in reserve near Franklin's headquarters. Jackson's main artillery batteries had remained silent in the fog during this exchange, but the Union troops soon began to receive direct fire from Prospect Hill, principally five batteries directed by Lt. Col. [[Reuben Lindsay Walker]], and Meade's attack was stalled about 600 yards from his initial objective for almost two hours by these combined artillery attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Rable, pp. 191–203; O'Reilly, pp. 135–65; Goolrick, pp. 63–65; Eicher, p. 400; Salmon, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

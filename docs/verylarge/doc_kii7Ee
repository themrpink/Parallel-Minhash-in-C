The decision to originally select Rickover as head of development of the nation's nuclear submarine program ultimately rested with Admiral Mills. According to Lieutenant General [[Leslie Groves]], director of the Manhattan Project, Mills was anxious to have a very determined man involved. He knew that Rickover was &quot;not too easy to get along with&quot; and &quot;not too popular,&quot; but in his judgement Rickover was the man on whom the Navy could depend &quot;no matter what opposition he might encounter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-306-80189-1 | page = 388 | last = Groves | first = Leslie R. |author2=Edward Teller | title = Now it can be told | year = 1983 | publisher = Da Capo Press | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his team and industry were completing construction of the world's first nuclear submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'' (SSN 571)]], Rickover was promoted to the rank of [[Rear Admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1953, however this was anything but routine, and occurred only after an extraordinary chain of events:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hyman G. Rickover|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/hyman-g-rickover|access-date=2020-06-27|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hyman-G-Rickover|title=Hyman G. Rickover &amp;#124; United States admiral|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Rickover's] peers in the Navy’s engineer branch thought to get rid of him through failure of promotion above captain. This would entail automatic retirement at the thirty-year mark. But someone made the case to the U.S. Senate, charged by the Constitution with formal confirmation of military promotions. In that year, 1953, two years before ''Nautilus'' first went to sea, the Senate failed to give its usual perfunctory approval of the Navy admiral promotion list, and the press was outraged because Rickover’s name was not on it. ... Ultimately an enlightened Secretary of the Navy, [[Robert B. Anderson]], ordered a special selection board to sit. With some shuffling of feet it did what it had been ordered to do.... Ninety-five percent of Navy captains must retire regardless of how highly qualified because there are only vacancies for 5 percent of them to become admirals, and although vindictiveness has sometimes played a part in determining who shall fail of selection for promotion (thus also violating the system), never before or since have pressures from outside the Navy overturned this form of career-termination.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless of the challenges faced in developing and operating brand-new technology, Rickover and the team did not disappoint: the result was a highly reliable nuclear reactor in a form-factor that would fit into a submarine hull with no more than a 28-foot [[Beam (nautical)|beam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | page = 134 | last = Blair | first = Clay | title = The Atomic Submarine and Admiral Rickover | year = 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the [[S1W reactor]]. ''Nautilus'' was launched and commissioned with this reactor in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/lwr3.shtml|title=Light Water Reactors Technology Development|website=www.ne.anl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Rickover oversaw the development of the [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]], the first commercial pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant. [[Kenneth Nichols]] of the AEC decided that the Rickover-Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor was ''&quot;the best choice for a reactor to demonstrate the production of electricity&quot;'' with Rickover ''&quot;having a going organization and a reactor project under way that now had no specific use to justify it.&quot;'' This was a reference to the first core used at Shippingport originating from a cancelled [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[aircraft carrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayton&quot;&gt;J.

Rickover was promoted to [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in 1958, the same year that he was awarded the first of two [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00001534&amp;mediaType=application/pdf |date=1959 |location=Washington, DC |title=Review of Naval Reactor Program and Admiral Rickover Award |publisher=United States Government Priniting Office |author=Joint Committee on Atomic Energy |via=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exercised tight control for the next three decades over the ships, technology, and personnel of the nuclear Navy, interviewing and approving or denying every prospective officer being considered for a nuclear ship. Over the course of Rickover's career, these personal interviews numbered in the tens of thousands; over 14,000 interviews were with recent college-graduates alone. The interviewees ranged from midshipmen and newly commissioned [[Ensign (rank)|ensigns]] destined for nuclear-powered submarines and surface combatants, to very senior combat-experienced [[Naval Aviator]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|captains]] who sought command of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The content of most of these interviews has been lost to history, though some were later chronicled in several books on Rickover's career, as well as in a [http://vimeo.com/56270169 rare personal interview] with [[Diane Sawyer]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1973, though his role and responsibilities remained unchanged, Rickover was promoted to the rank of four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-07-09-mn-14301-story.html|title=Rickover, Creator of U.S. Nuclear Navy, Dies at 86|date=July 9, 1986|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time in the history of the U.S. Navy that an officer with a career path other than an operational line officer achieved that rank.  Also fairly uniquely&amp;mdash;and because his responsibilities did not include direct command and control of combatant naval units&amp;mdash;technically he was appointed to the grade of admiral on the retired list so as to provide some clarity on this issue.  This was also done to avoid affecting the maximum-authorized number of admirals (O-10) on the &quot;active list.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public2.nhhcaws.local/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/rickover-promotion.html|title=Hyman G.

As head of Naval Reactors, Rickover's focus and responsibilities were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus was well known during Rickover's era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way that this was addressed after Rickover retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine commanders have held Rickover's now unique eight-year position as [[Naval Reactors|NAVSEA-08]], the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/45608main_NNBE_Progress_Report2_7-15-03.pdf|title=NASA/Navy Benchmarking Exchange (NNBE) Volume II|publisher=Nasa.gov|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12344.html|title=Executive Orders|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Archives.gov|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Rickover's first replacement, [[Kinnaird R.

Historian Francis Duncan, who for over eight years was granted generous access to diverse numbers and levels of witnesses&amp;mdash;including U.S. presidents&amp;mdash;as well as Rickover himself,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rickover-and-the-nuclear-navy-francis-duncan/1121795147 Francis Duncan – author information]&lt;/ref&gt; came to the conclusion that the man was best understood with respect to a guiding principle that Rickover invoked foremost for both himself and those who served in the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program: &quot;exercise of the concept of responsibility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/04/f50/DuncanRickoverandtheNuclearNavyComplete_1.pdf |title=Rickover and the Nuclear Navy |via=Department of Energy |date=1990 |first=Francis |last=Duncan |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=0-87021-236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is further evidenced by Rickover listing ''responsibility'' as his first [[principle]] in his final-years paper and speech, ''Thoughts on Man's Purpose in Life.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/archive/morgenthau/763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto5&quot;&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/archive/morgenthau/763/_res/id=Attachments/index=0/763_2ndMML-H.G.Rickover.pdf|publisher=Council on Religion and International Affairs|location=New York|title=Thoughts on Man's Purpose in Life|first=Rickover|last=Hyman|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nielsolson.us/Writing/RickoverRotaryAddress10FEB77.html|title=Rickover Rotary Address|website=nielsolson.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety record ===
Rickover's stringent standards are largely credited with being responsible for the U.S. Navy's continuing record of zero reactor accidents (defined as the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core).&lt;ref name=bowman&gt;{{cite web | title = Statement of Admiral F. L. &quot;Skip&quot; Bowman | date = 2003-10-29 | access-date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/bowman031029.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it a point to be aboard during the initial sea trial of almost every nuclear submarine completing its new-construction period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power at Sea, Vol 3: A Violent Peace, 1946–2006|url=https://archive.org/details/poweratseabreaki02libg|url-access=limited|last=Rose|first=Lisle A.|publisher=University of Missouri|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/poweratseabreaki02libg/page/n73 55]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Three Mile Island accident]] on March 28, 1979, Admiral Rickover was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents, as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place.&lt;ref name=&quot;bowman&quot; /&gt;

The accident-free record of United States Navy reactor operations stands in some very stark contrast to those of the Soviet Union, which had [[Nuclear submarine#Accidents|fourteen known reactor accidents]].  As stated in a retrospective analysis in October 2007:

&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. submarines far outperformed the Soviet ones in the crucial area of stealth, and Rickover's obsessive fixation on safety and quality control gave the U.S. nuclear Navy a vastly superior safety record to the Soviet one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sieff | first = Martin | title = BMD Focus: O'Reilly moves up&amp;nbsp;– Part 1 | work = UPI Energy| date = 2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Views on nuclear power ===
Given Rickover's single-minded focus on naval nuclear propulsion, design, and operations, it came as a surprise to many&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atomicinsights.com/2010/11/admiral-rickovers-final-testimony-to-congress.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628112919/http://atomicinsights.com/2010/11/admiral-rickovers-final-testimony-to-congress.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-06-28|title=Admiral Rickover's Final Testimony to Congress |work=Atomic Insights|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982, near the end of his career, when he testified before the U.S. Congress that, were it up to him what to do with nuclear powered ships, he &quot;would sink them all.&quot; At a congressional hearing Rickover testified that:

{{quote|I do not believe that nuclear power is worth it if it creates radiation. Then you might ask me why do I have nuclear powered ships. That is a necessary evil. I would sink them all. I am not proud of the part I played in it. I did it because it was necessary for the safety of this country. That's why I am such a great exponent of stopping this whole nonsense of war. Unfortunately limits—attempts to limit war have always failed. The lesson of history is when a war starts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon it has available. ... Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. ... It is important that we control these forces and try to eliminate them.|Economics of Defense Policy: Hearing before the Joint Economic Committee, Congress of the United States, 97th Cong., 2nd sess., Pt. 1 (1982)}}

A few months later, following his retirement, Rickover spoke more specifically regarding the questions &quot;Could you comment on your own responsibility in helping to create a nuclear navy? Do you have any regrets?&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not have regrets. I believe I helped preserve the peace for this country. Why should I regret that? What I accomplished was approved by Congress—which represents our people. All of you live in safety from domestic enemies because of security from the police. Likewise, you live in safety from foreign enemies because our military keeps them from attacking us. Nuclear technology was already under development in other countries. My assigned responsibility was to develop our nuclear navy. I managed to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rickover |first= Hyman George |title= Thoughts on Man's Purpose in Life |url= https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/archive/morgenthau/763/_res/id=Attachments/index=0/763_2ndMML-H.G.Rickover.pdf |access-date= 2009-03-17 |series= Second Annual Morgenthau Memorial Lecture |date= 1982-05-12 |publisher= Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==
Rickover has been called &quot;the most famous and controversial admiral of his era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1612517971 | page = 1 | last = Oliver | first = Dave | title = Against the Tide | year = 2014 | publisher = Naval Institute Press | location = Annapolis, MD }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hyperactive, blunt, confrontational, insulting, and a workaholic, always demanding of others without regard for rank or position. Moreover, he had &quot;little tolerance for mediocrity, none for stupidity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9sLAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Rickover+%22he+ought+to+be+dead%22|title=Time|access-date=2014-12-12|last1=Hadden|first1=Briton|last2=Luce|first2=Henry Robinson|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even while a captain, Rickover did not conceal his opinions, and many of the officers whom he regarded as unintelligent eventually rose to be admirals and were assigned to the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819338-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: The Man in Tempo 3 | date=1954-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickover frequently found himself in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, to the point that he almost missed becoming an admiral; two selection boards passed him over for promotion, and it took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy before he was promoted.&lt;ref name=&quot;time1954&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-595-25270-2 | page = 155 | last = Rockwell | first = Theodore | title = The Rickover Effect | year = 2002 | publisher = IUniverse | location = Lincoln, NE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickover's military authority and congressional mandate were absolute with regard to the U.S. fleet's reactor operations, but his controlling personality was frequently a subject of internal Navy controversy. He was head of the Naval Reactors branch, and thus responsible for signing off on a crew's competence to operate the reactor safely, giving him the power to effectively remove a warship from active service, which he did on several occasions. The view became established that he sometimes exercised power to settle scores.&lt;ref&gt;''Rickover and the Nuclear Navy: The Discipline of Technology'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]] referred to him as a &quot;tyrant&quot; with &quot;no account of his gradually failing powers&quot; in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;''United States Submarines'', 2002, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus on education==

When he was a child still living in Russian-occupied Poland, Rickover was not allowed to attend public schools because of his Jewish faith. Starting at the age of four, he attended a religious school where the teaching was solely from the ''[[Tanakh]]'', i.e., ''[[Old Testament]]'', in [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-595-25270-2 | page = 20 | last = Rockwell | first = Theodore | title = The Rickover Effect | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U4kjnYL7-igC&amp;q=Rickover,+Sabath&amp;pg=PA21 | year = 2002 | publisher = IUniverse | location = Lincoln, NE }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his formal education in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prairiefirenewspaper.com/2008/12/my-father-remembered|title=My father remembered|publisher=Prairiefirenewspaper.com|access-date=2014-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218065332/http://prairiefirenewspaper.com/2008/12/my-father-remembered|archive-date=2015-02-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickover developed a decades-long and outspoken interest in the educational standards of the US as being a national security issue, particularly as compared during the [[Cold War]] era to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Rickover |first=Hyman George |title=Energy resources and our future |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/23151 |event=Annual Scientific Assembly of the Minnesota State Medical Association |location=St. Paul, MN |date=14 May 1957 |access-date=21 March 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66O1h26f0?url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/23151 |archive-date=23 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of his passion for education from his 1959 ''Report on Russia''&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Rickover, &quot;Report on Russia&quot;, US GPO 1959 https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uE0vAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-uE0vAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of comparative educational systems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is no room here (in nuclear powerplant development) for lofty theories which do not work out in practice. We would not get anywhere if we had the loose, hazy thinking you encounter when you bring out the obvious failures of the American educational system. ... there are times when it is irresponsible to avoid criticizing something which one knows to be wrong and dangerous for the Nation as a whole. I feel that every one who has a position of responsibility in this country and who can see and understand what is happening not only has the right, he has the obligation and the duty to speak. ... This is why I feel so strongly about education—about our failure to give our children as good an education as they deserve and need. ... It is my considered opinion that there is no problem that faces the Congress or the country that is as important.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rickover believed that US standards of education were unacceptably low. His first book centered on education was a collection of essays calling for improved standards of education, particularly in math and science, entitled ''Education and Freedom'' (1959). In it, he stated that &quot;education is the most important problem facing the United States today&quot; and &quot;only the massive upgrading of the scholastic standards of our schools will guarantee the future prosperity and freedom of the Republic.&quot; A second book, ''Swiss Schools and Ours'' (1962) was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of Switzerland and America. He argued that the higher standards of Swiss schools, including a longer school day and year, combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3077&amp;context=luc_diss |title=Admiral Hyman G.

Recognizing that &quot;nurturing careers of excellence and leadership in science and technology in young scholars is an essential investment in the United States national and global future,&quot; following his retirement Rickover founded the [[Center for Excellence in Education]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History of CEE: Center for Excellence in Education | access-date = 2009-03-21 | url = http://www.cee.org/about/history | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318222622/http://www.cee.org/about/history | archive-date = 2009-03-18 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Research Science Institute]] (formerly the Rickover Science Institute), founded by Rickover in 1984, is a summer science program hosted by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for high school seniors from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cee.org/events/rsi-2017-rickover-award|title=RSI 2017 Rickover Award &amp;#124; Center for Excellence in Education|website=www.cee.org|access-date=2019-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207195729/https://www.cee.org/events/rsi-2017-rickover-award|archive-date=2019-12-07|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The General Dynamics scandal ==
In the early 1980s, structural welding flaws in submarines under construction were covered up by falsified inspection records, and the resulting scandal led to significant delays and expenses in the delivery of several submarines being built at the [[General Dynamics]] [[Electric Boat]] Division shipyard in [[Groton, Connecticut]]. The yard tried to pass on the vast cost overruns to the Navy, while Rickover demanded that the yard make good on its &quot;shoddy&quot; workmanship. The Navy settled with General Dynamics in 1981, paying out $634 million of $843 million in {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|1}} cost overrun and reconstruction claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeDec84&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0040-781X | last = Van Voorst | first = Bruce |author2=Thomas Evans | title = Overrun Silent, Overrun Deep | work = Time | access-date = 2009-03-19 | date = 1984-12-24 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951382,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0040-781X | last = Alexander | first = Charles P. |author2=Christopher Redman |author3=John E.

A Navy Ad Hoc Gratuities Board determined that Rickover had received gifts from General Dynamics over a 16-year period valued at $67,628, including jewelry, furniture, exotic knives, and gifts that Rickover had in turn presented to politicians. Charges were investigated that gifts were provided by [[General Electric]] and the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock]], both major nuclear ship contractors for the Navy. Secretary Lehman admonished him in a non-punitive letter and stated that Rickover's &quot;fall from grace with these little trinkets should be viewed in the context of his enormous contributions to the Navy.&quot; Rickover released a statement through his lawyer saying his &quot;conscience is clear&quot; with respect to the gifts. &quot;No gratuity or favor ever affected any decision I made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-9051:1|title=Congressional research service}} {{small|(1.65 MB CRS-13)}} Alleged fraud, waste, and abuse, 07/12/85.

==Forced retirement==
By the late 1970s, Rickover's position seemed stronger than it had ever been. Over many years, powerful friends on both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees ensured that he remained on active duty long after most other admirals had retired from their second careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Unsinkable Hyman Rickover |journal=Time | access-date = 2009-03-20 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911955,00.html?iid=chix-sphere | date=1977-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Carter]]'s admiration for Rickover was shown by the fact that the title of Carter's autobiography was based on a question that Rickover had asked Carter when the latter was in the Navy (&quot;Why Not The Best?&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8QrkpOEJlQC|title = Why Not the Best?: The First Fifty Years|isbn = 9781610754606|last1 = Carter|first1 = Jimmy|date = August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Why Not The Best? (introductory material)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Secretary of the Navy [[John Lehman]] felt that Rickover was hindering the well-being of the navy. As Lehman stated in his book, ''Command of the Seas'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of my first orders of business as Secretary of the Navy would be to solve ... the Rickover problem. Rickover's legendary achievements were in the past. His present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm. I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy's grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnflehman.com/books/books_commandseas.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715043807/http://www.johnflehman.com/books/books_commandseas.html|url-status=dead|title=johnflehman.com|archive-date=July 15, 2012|website=www.johnflehman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secretary Lehman eventually attained enough political clout to enforce his decision to retire Rickover. This was in part assisted by the admiral's nearly insubordinate stance against paying the General Dynamics submarine construction claims, as well as his advanced age and waning political leverage. On July 27, 1981, Lehman was handed the final impetus for ending Rickover's career by way of an operational error on the admiral's part: a &quot;moderate&quot; loss of ship control and depth excursion while performing a submerged &quot;crash back&quot; maneuver during the sea trials of the newly constructed {{USS|La Jolla}}. Rickover was the actual man-in-charge during this specific performance test, and his actions and inactions were judged to have been the causal factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19810822&amp;id=pnIQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3287,1471323|title=The Free Lance-Star |via=Google News Archive Search|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/09/23/running-critical/8d9de415-33c3-465b-8ba3-0ad4637c6bbb/|title=Running Critical |date=23 September 1986|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sdut-navy-submarine-lajollasandiego-2014oct21-story.html|title=San Diego says goodbye to La Jolla|first=Gary|last=Robbins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ky-3B5ARy2sC&amp;q=%22la+jolla%22+rickover&amp;pg=PA143|title=Fall From Glory: The Men Who Sank the U.S. Navy|first=Gregory|last=Vistica|year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0684832265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6NnRc1lBdIC&amp;q=%22la+jolla%22+rickover&amp;pg=PA84|title=Rickover: Father of the Nuclear Navy|first1=Thomas B.|last1=Allen|first2=Norman|last2=Polmar|date=2017|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1574884456}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31, 1982, four days after his 82nd birthday, Rickover was forced to retire from the Navy after 63 years of service under 13 [[presidents of the United States|presidents]] ([[Woodrow Wilson]] through [[Ronald Reagan]]). According to Rickover, he first learned of his firing when his wife told him what she heard on the radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acm.com/team/adams_story.html|title=Joel's Story: Near the Ocean Floor|website=www.acm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former President [[Jimmy Carter]], several weeks following his retirement, Rickover &quot;was invited to the Oval Office and decided to don his full dress uniform. He told me that he refused to take a seat, listened to the president [Reagan] ask him to be his special nuclear advisor, replied 'Mr. President, that is bullshit,' and then walked out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | pages = 492, 493 | last = Carter | first = Jimmy | title = White House Diary | year = 2010 | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy's official investigation of General Dynamics' Electric Boat division was ended shortly afterward. According to Theodore Rockwell, Rickover's Technical Director for more than 15 years, more than one source at that time stated that General Dynamics officials were bragging around Washington that they had &quot;gotten Rickover.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made a Difference|author=Rockwell, T.|date=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0595252701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4kjnYL7-igC&amp;pg=RA1-PA363|pages=1–363|access-date=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 1983, a post-retirement party honoring Admiral Rickover was attended by all three living former U.S. Presidents at the time: [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], and Carter, all formerly officers in the U.S. Navy. President Reagan was not in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Feinman | first = By Elisabeth Bumiller and Barbara | title = Rickover at 83: Three-Gun Salute; Ex-Presidents Hail the Father of the Nuclear Navy | work = The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 96B05426.lowres.jpeg | access-date = 2009-03-06 | url = http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/BERKELEY-LAB/images/96B05426.lowres.jpeg | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325162838/http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/BERKELEY-LAB/images/96B05426.lowres.jpeg | archive-date = 2009-03-25 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But He Is Embedded In My Mind And My Heart | agency = Associated Press | date = 1986-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the request of the admiral's widow, President Carter read [[John Milton|Milton's]] sonnet ''[[When I Consider How My Light is Spent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halloran |first1=Richard |title=A 'Teacher' Recalled at Rickover Rite |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/15/us/a-teacher-recalled-at-rickover-rite.html |access-date=3 March 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=15 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of the Navy Lehman said in a statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;With the death of Adm. Rickover, the Navy and this nation have lost a dedicated officer of historic accomplishment. In his 63 years of service, Adm. Rickover took the concept of nuclear power from an idea to the present reality of more than 150 U.S. naval ships under nuclear power, with a record of 3,000 ship-years of accident-free operations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And the then-Chief of Naval Operations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Most important,&quot; Admiral Watkins said, &quot;he was a teacher. He set the standards. They were tough. That is the legacy and the challenge he left to all who study his contributions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/15/us/a-teacher-recalled-at-rickover-rite.html &quot;A 'Teacher' Recalled at Rickover Rite&quot;] Richard Halloran, The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Honors==
[[File:USS Rickover.jpg|thumb|USS ''Hyman G. Rickover'' (SSN-709)]]
The ''Los Angeles''-class submarine {{USS|Hyman G. Rickover|SSN-709}} was named for him. It was commissioned two years before his death, and was, at that time, one of only two Navy ships to be [[List of U.S. military vessels named after living Americans|named after a living person]] since 1900 (there have been 16 more since). The submarine was launched on August 27, 1983, sponsored by his second wife Eleonore, commissioned on July 21, 1984, and deactivated on December 14, 2006. In 2015, the Navy announced a {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|1}} named {{USS|Hyman G.

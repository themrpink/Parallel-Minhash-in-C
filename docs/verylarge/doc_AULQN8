On April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general classroom boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}

On April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson by rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505–21}}

Zhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed to take firm action against the protesters.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505–21}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate warning must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603–06}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests, and highlighted Deng's having &quot;final say&quot; on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.

On April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled &quot;[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]]&quot;. The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The editorial invoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric that had been used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]—an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as &quot;patriotic&quot; under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment of the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired: instead of scaring students into submission, it antagonized the students and put them squarely against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603–06}}

===April 27 demonstrations===
{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}
[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] ]]

Organized by the Union, on April 27 some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of &quot;anti-corruption&quot; and &quot;anti-cronyism&quot;, but &quot;pro-party&quot;.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of the April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}

The stunning success of the march forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wu'erkaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}

The government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory when Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and reasserted his authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be allowed to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3–4. In the speeches, Zhao said that the students' concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by the April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeated demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the classroom boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}

==Escalation of the Protests==

===Preparing for dialogue===
{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}

The government was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, tensions between the progressive camp and the conservative camp intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrode all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}

In preparation for dialogue, the Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of dialogue, dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational tactics. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike that would begin on May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161–62}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=163}}

===Hunger strikes begin===
{{main|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|upright|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on May 10, 1989. The Chinese words written on the paper say, &quot;We want freedom of newspapers, freedom of associations, also to support the '[[World Economic Herald]]', and support those just journalists.&quot;]]

Students began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612–14}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}

Inspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their support of the classroom boycott and the demands of the protesters. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and while at, the square.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

Afraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612–14}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood that signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation and not just the government. On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]], and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said that the government was prepared to hold an immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether or not the students withdrew—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}

===Mikhail Gorbachev's visit===
{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}

Press restrictions were loosened significantly from early to mid May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On May 14, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals in the ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally, as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as &quot;patriotic and democratic&quot;; Li refused.{{sfn|Li|2010|loc=May 15 entry}}

The students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings were derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (&quot;loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]&quot;){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more hardline path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612–14}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on May 16, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the &quot;paramount authority&quot; in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612–14}}

===Gathering momentum===
The hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from May 17 to 18. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of the students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, shining an international spotlight on the movement. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.

The movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By May 17, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of various sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each having its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as an appropriate response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}

The situation seemed intractable and the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17 during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010|loc=May 17 entry}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2–48}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]], and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]], on May 4, Zhao had exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2–48}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25–34}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that &quot;there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control&quot;, and so &quot;the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]&quot;{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2–48}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of &quot;[[bourgeois liberalism]]&quot; advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28–30}}

On the evening of May 17, the PSC met at Zhongnanhai to finalize plans for martial law. At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to &quot;take leave&quot;, citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2–48}} The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2–48}} Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications for martial law;{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=x}} Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], mobilized the military to move into the capital.

Li Peng [[Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement#May 18: meeting with Li Peng|met with students]] for the first time on May 18 in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}} During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 Editorial and affirm the student movement as &quot;patriotic&quot;. Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending the hunger strikers to hospitals. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=41}} but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=343}} By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and of Li Peng and Deng became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=42-43}} Slogans targeted Deng personally, for instance calling him the &quot;power behind the throne&quot;.{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=May 19}}

[[File:Wen Jiabao (Cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wen Jiabao]], then chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], accompanied Zhao Ziyang to meet with students in the Square, surviving the political purge of the party's liberals and later serving as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] from 2003 to 2013.]]

In the early morning of May 19, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]]. He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}} He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}}

{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry. You talk about us, criticize us, it is all necessary. The reason that I came here is not to ask you to forgive us.

[...] You are still young, there are still many days yet to come, you must live healthy, and see the day when China accomplishes the [[Four Modernizations]]. You are not like us, we are already old, it doesn't matter to us any more.|quoted=1|source=—[[Zhao Ziyang]] at Tiananmen Square, 19 May 1989}}

On 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was &quot;mistaken&quot; in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.

===Surveillance of protesters===
Student leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities; traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square; and nearby restaurants, and wherever students gathered, were wiretapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;4-corners-tremble-and-obey&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|url=https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758|series=Four Coners|title=Tremble &amp; Obey|time=00:24:50|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-date=October 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008024233/https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surveillance led to the identification, capture, and punishment of protest participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;surveillance-politics&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Richard Victor Ericson|last1=Kevin D.

===Outside Beijing===
{{main|Gifts and donations from outside Mainland China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}

University students in Shanghai also took to the streets to commemorate the death of Hu Yaobang and protest against certain policies of the government. In many cases, these were supported by the universities' own party cells. [[Jiang Zemin]], then–Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and &quot;expressed his understanding&quot;, as he was a student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored; and many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121–32}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]], his decisive action earning the trust of conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.

In Hong Kong on May 27, over 300,000 people gathered at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] for a gathering called the [[Concert for Democracy in China]] ({{zh|t=民主歌聲獻中華}}). Many Hong Kong celebrities sang songs and expressed their support for the students in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=dragonmui |title=Playlist of 'Democratic Songs for China' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVjUGz_bHnU&amp;list=PLF7C9846E075808EB |accessdate=October 22, 2018 |via=YouTube |archive-date=February 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227230209/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVjUGz_bHnU&amp;list=PLF7C9846E075808EB |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;concert&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Macklin |first1=Simon |last2=Tang |first2=John |title=Organisers ready for mass concert |work=South China Morning Post |date=May 27, 1989 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a procession of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people, one fourth of Hong Kong's population, led by [[Martin Lee]], [[Szeto Wah]], and other organization leaders, paraded through [[Hong Kong Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aothervastcrowd&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yeung |first1=Chris |title=Another vast crowd joins world-wide show of solidarity |work=South China Morning Post |date=May 29, 1989 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, especially where ethnic Chinese lived, people gathered and protested.

The Chinese government declared [[martial law]] on May 20 and [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Mobilization|mobilized at least 30 divisions]] from five of the country's [[PLA Military Region|seven military regions]].{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} At least 14 of the PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops.{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} As many as 250,000 troops were eventually sent to the capital, some arriving by air and others by rail.{{sfn|Wu: Troop Estimate}} Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities suspended civil airline travel to prepare for transporting military units.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80–82}}

The army's entry into the capital was blocked in the suburbs by throngs of protesters. Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces then retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Richelson | Evans | 1999}}{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} While the army's withdrawal was initially seen as &quot;turning the tide&quot; in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization was taking place across the country for a final assault.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80–82}}

At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and its consequences. He advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by hardline student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of &quot;mini-coups&quot;: whoever controlled the loudspeakers was &quot;in charge&quot; of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives, such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a &quot;well-organized and premeditated plot&quot;.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}}

===June 1–3===
On June 1, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled &quot;On the True Nature of the Turmoil&quot;, which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report aimed to persuade the Politburo of the necessity and legality of clearing Tiananmen Square by referring to the protestors as terrorists and counterrevolutionaries.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report stated that turmoil was continuing to grow, the students had no plans to leave, and they were gaining popular support.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=335}} Further justification for martial law came in the form of a report submitted by the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS) to the party leadership. The report emphasized the danger of infiltration of [[bourgeois liberalism]] into China and the negative effect that the West, particularly the United States, had on the students.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001 |p=338}} The MSS expressed its belief that American forces had intervened in the student movement in hopes of overthrowing the Communist Party.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=343}} The report created a sense of urgency within the party, and provided justification for military action.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=338}} In conjunction with the plan to clear the Square by force, the Politburo received word from army headquarters stating that troops were ready to help stabilize the capital, and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=349}}

On June 2, with increasing action on the part of protesters, the CPC saw that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=353}} They were also outraged by the ''Beijing Daily''{{'}}s June 1 article &quot;Tiananmen, I Cry for You&quot;, which was written by a fellow student who had become disillusioned with the movement, as he thought it was chaotic and disorganized.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=353}} In response to the articles, thousands of students lined the streets of Beijing to protest against leaving the Square.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=362}}

Three intellectuals—[[Liu Xiaobo]], Zhou Duo, and Gao Xin—and Taiwanese singer [[Hou Dejian]] declared a second hunger strike to revive the movement.{{sfn|Brook| 1998|p=94}} After weeks of occupying the Square, the students were tired; and internal rifts opened between moderate and hardline student groups.{{sfn|Mathews | 1989}} In their declaration speech, the hunger strikers openly criticized the government's suppression of the movement, to remind the students that their cause was worth fighting for, and pushing them to continue their occupation of the Square.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=363}}

On June 2, Deng Xiaoping and several [[Eight Elders|party elders]] met with the three PSC members—[[Li Peng]], [[Qiao Shi]], and [[Yao Yilin]]—who remained after Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili had been ousted. The committee members agreed to clear the Square so &quot;the riot can be halted and order be restored to the Capital&quot;.{{sfn|Wu: Clear the Square}}{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|pp=355–62}} They also agreed that the Square needed to be cleared as peacefully as possible; but if protesters did not cooperate, the troops would be authorized to use force to complete the job.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=362}} That day, state-run newspapers reported that troops were positioned in ten key areas in the city.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=362}}{{sfn|Mathews | 1989}} Units of the [[27th Army (People's Republic of China)|27th]], [[65th Army (People's Republic of China)|65th]], and 24th armies were [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Enforcement of martial law|secretly moved]] into the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the Square and the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] compound east of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Troop Movements}}

On the evening of June 2, reports that an army [[Trencher (machine)|trencher]] ran over four civilians, killing three, sparked fear that the army and the police were trying to advance into Tiananmen Square.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=366}} Student leaders issued emergency orders to set up roadblocks at major intersections to prevent the entry of troops into the center of the city.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=366}}

On the morning of June 3, students and residents discovered troops dressed in plainclothes trying to smuggle weapons into the city.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The students seized and handed the weapons to Beijing police.{{sfn|Wu: June 3}} The students protested outside the Xinhua Gate of the Zhongnanhai leadership compound and the police fired tear gas.{{sfn|Kristof: Residents Block Army}} Unarmed troops emerged from the Great Hall of the People and were quickly met with crowds of protesters.{{sfn|The Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Several protesters tried to injure the troops as they collided outside the Great Hall of the People, forcing soldiers to temporarily retreat.{{sfn|Richelson | Evans | 1999}}

At 4:30{{nbsp}}pm on June 3, the three PSC members met with military leaders, Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]], mayor [[Chen Xitong]], and member of the State Council secretariat [[Luo Gan]], and finalized the order for the enforcement of martial law:{{sfn|Wu: Clear the Square}}
# The operation to quell the counterrevolutionary riot was to begin at 9{{nbsp}}pm.
# Military units should converge on the Square by 1{{nbsp}}am on June 4 and the Square must be cleared by 6{{nbsp}}am.
# No delays would be tolerated.
# No person may impede the advance of the troops enforcing martial law. The troops may act in self-defense and use any means to clear impediments.
# State media will broadcast warnings to citizens.{{sfn|Wu: Clear the Square}}

The order did not explicitly contain a shoot-to-kill directive but permission to &quot;use any means&quot; was understood by some units as authorization to use lethal force. That evening, the government leaders monitored the operation from the [[Great Hall of the People]] and [[Zhongnanhai]].{{sfn|Wu: Clear the Square}}{{sfn|Timothy Brook interview|2006}}

On the evening of June 3, state-run television warned residents to stay indoors; but crowds of people took to the streets, as they had two weeks before, to block the incoming army. [[People's Liberation Army|PLA units]] advanced on Beijing from every direction—the [[38th Army (People's Republic of China)|38th]], 63rd, and 28th armies from the west; the [[15th Airborne Corps]], [[20th Army (People's Republic of China)|20th]], [[26th Army (People's Republic of China)|26th]], and [[54th Army (People's Republic of China)|54th]] armies from the south; the [[39th Army (People's Republic of China)|39th Army]] and the [[1st Armored Division (People's Republic of China)|1st Armored Division]] from the east; and the [[40th Army (People's Republic of China)|40th]] and 64th armies from the north.{{sfn|Wu: June 3}}

In search of a replacement vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer [[Terry Reid]]. Though he found the offer &quot;flattering&quot;, Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer [[Mickie Most]] and more interested in his solo career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |work=The Independent |title=Interview: Singer and guitarist Terry Reid |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502125422/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |archive-date=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer Ian Gillan from [[Episode Six]], a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Gillan had at one time been approached by Nick Simper when Deep Purple was first forming, but had reportedly told Simper that the Roundabout project would not go anywhere, whereas he felt Episode Six was poised to make it big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&amp;type=1&amp;lang=EN |title=Rockpages.gr interview with Nick Simper |last=Anasontzis |first=George |publisher=Rockpages |accessdate=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901130712/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&amp;type=1&amp;lang=EN |archive-date=1 September 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six's drummer [[Mick Underwood]] – an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]] – introduced the band to Gillan and bassist [[Roger Glover]]. This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for [[Gillan (band)|his new post-Purple band]] in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Roger was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen Interview 1&quot;/&gt;

So I said okay.&quot;|source =— Ritchie Blackmore on the hiring of [[Roger Glover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen Interview 1&quot;/&gt;}}

This created the Deep Purple Mark II line-up, whose first release was a [[Roger Greenaway]]-[[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] tune titled &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallelujah&quot;/&gt; At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band, and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Simper recalls pain of Purple sacking |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/deep-purple-nick-simper-pain-of-sacking |accessdate=21 March 2020 |agency=Louder Sound.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite television appearances to promote the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; single in the UK, the song flopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallelujah&quot;/&gt; Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper ''[[Record Mirror]]'' that the band &quot;need to have a commercial record in Britain&quot;, and described the song as &quot;an in-between sort of thing&quot;—a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallelujah&quot;&gt;Bloom, Jerry (2008). &quot;Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore&quot; p.128. Omnibus Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The band gained some much-needed publicity in September 1969 with the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt; Alongside ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]] and ''[[Five Bridges]]'' by [[the Nice]], it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra.

Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance &quot;you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the Thames.&quot; Lord would also write the ''[[Gemini Suite Live|Gemini Suite]]'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra'' wasn't bad but the ''Gemini Suite'' was horrible and very disjointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steven Rosen |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |work=Guitar International |year=1975 |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview: Deep Purple, Rainbow and Dio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222064521/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |archive-date=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Highway Star: Deep Purple's Roger Glover Interviewed |work=The Quietus |date=20 January 2011 |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05569-deep-purple-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough success (1970–1973)===
[[File:Deep Purple (1971).JPG|thumb|right|240px|The classic Deep Purple line-up, 1971. Left to right: Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice]]
Shortly after the orchestral release, Deep Purple began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next three years. Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was ''[[Deep Purple in Rock|In Rock]]'' (a name supported by the album's [[Mount Rushmore]]-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples &quot;[[Speed King]]&quot;, &quot;Into The Fire&quot; and &quot;[[Child in Time]]&quot;. The non-album single &quot;[[Black Night]]&quot;, released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top Ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;&gt;Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Gillan's powerful, wide-ranging vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton&quot;&gt;Charlton, Katherine (2003). ''Rock Music Styles: A History''. p. 241. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Zeppelin's ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' and Sabbath's ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'', ''In Rock'' codified the budding [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wasler&quot;/&gt;

On the album's development, Blackmore stated: &quot;I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, 'well, this is my turn.' Jon was into more classical. I said, 'well you've done that, I'll do rock, and whatever turns out best we'll carry on with.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KS3P8AjJCc Steve Rosen Interview with Ritchie Blackmore, 1974] Retrieved from YouTube &quot;Ritchie Blackmore, Guitar God|Part 2/5&quot; on 14 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''In Rock'' performed well, especially in the UK where it reached No. 4, while the &quot;Black Night&quot; single reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and the band performed the song live on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bloom (2007). &quot;Black Knight&quot;. p. 139. Music Sales Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; In addition to increasing sales in the UK, the band were making a name for themselves as a live act, particularly with regard to the sheer volume of their shows and the improvisational skills of Blackmore and Lord. Said Lord, &quot;We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?' The audience didn't know, and nine times out of ten, neither did we!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;

A second album, the creatively progressive ''[[Fireball (album)|Fireball]]'', was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching number 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27669/DEEP-PURPLE &quot;Deep Purple: UK Charts&quot;].

Within weeks of ''Fireball''{{'}}s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became &quot;[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]&quot;) was performed at the first show of the ''Fireball'' tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: &quot;How do you go about writing songs?&quot; On 24 October 1971 during the US leg of the Fireball tour, the band was set to play the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago when Ian Gillan contracted [[hepatitis]], forcing the band to play without him, with bassist Glover singing the set. After this, the rest of the US dates were canceled and the band flew home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehighwaystar.com/FAQ/history.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=Thehighwaystar.com|accessdate=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. The album was due to be recorded at the [[Montreux Casino]] using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], but a fire during a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[the Mothers of Invention]] concert, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song &quot;[[Smoke on the Water]]&quot;. The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty [[Hôtel des Alpes-Grand Hôtel|Grand Hôtel de Territet]], with the exception of the music track to &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. That was recorded at a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, before the band was asked to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu où est né &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC.

Continuing from where both previous albums left off, ''Machine Head'' was released in late March 1972 and became one of the band's most famous releases. It was the band's second No. 1 album in the UK while re-establishing them in North America, hitting No. 7 in the US and No. 1 in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; It included tracks that became live classics, such as &quot;Highway Star&quot;, &quot;[[Space Truckin']]&quot;, &quot;[[Lazy (Deep Purple song)|Lazy]]&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, for which Deep Purple are most famous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/machine-head-r5332/charts-awards Billboard – Machine Head] Allmusic.

[[File:Ian Gillan (1972).jpg|thumb|upright|Gillan on stage in [[Clemson, South Carolina]], 1972]]

In January 1972 the band returned to tour the US once again, then headed over to play Europe before resuming US dates in March. While in America Blackmore contracted hepatitis, and the band attempted one show in [[Flint, Michigan]], without a guitarist before attempting to acquire the services of [[Al Kooper]], who rehearsed with the band before bowing out, suggesting [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] guitarist [[Randy California]] instead. California played one show with the group, in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]] on 6 April, but the rest of this tour was cancelled as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehighwaystar.comFAQhistory.html] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band returned to the US in late May 1972 to undertake their third North America tour (of four total that year). A Japan tour in August of that year led to a double-vinyl live release, ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]''. Originally intended as a Japan-only record, its worldwide release saw the double LP become an instant hit. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live-concert recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Made in Japan&quot;/&gt;

The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up continued to work, and released the album ''[[Who Do We Think We Are]]'' in 1973. Spawning the hit single &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot;, the album hit No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 15 in the US chart, while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/deep%20purple |title=The Official Charts Company – Who Do We Think We Are |date=5 May 2013 |publisher=The Official Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/who-do-we-think-we-are-mw0000196958/awards |title=Who Do We Think We Are on ''Billboard'' |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever.

Gillan admitted in a 1984 interview that the band was pushed by management to complete the ''Who Do We Think We Are'' album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break.&lt;ref&gt;''Deep Purple: The Interview''. Interview picture disc, 1984, Mercury Records.&lt;/ref&gt; The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan quitting the band after their second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973, followed by the dismissal of Glover, at Blackmore's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Buckley (2003).

The band hired Midlands bassist/vocalist [[Glenn Hughes (English singer)|Glenn Hughes]], formerly of [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]]. According to Paice, Glover told him and Lord a few months before his official termination that he wanted to leave the band, so they had started to drop in on Trapeze shows.

A month later, the band's 22 May performance at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], London, was recorded for the live album ''[[Live in London (Deep Purple album)|Live in London]]''.

This lineup's first studio album, titled ''[[Burn (Deep Purple album)|Burn]]'', was highly successful, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; The [[Burn (Deep Purple song)|title track]], which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III era, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement, which was popularised at the time by bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Gentle Giant]]. &quot;Burn&quot; was a complex arrangement that showcased all the members' virtuosity and particularly Blackmore's classically influenced guitar prowess, while Hughes and Coverdale provided vocal harmonies and elements of funk and blues, respectively, to the music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release ''[[Stormbringer (album)|Stormbringer]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderlee&quot; /&gt; Besides the title track, the ''Stormbringer'' album had a number of songs that received much radio play, such as &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot;, &quot;The Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, and the album reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 20 on the US ''Billboard'' chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; However, Blackmore publicly disliked the album and the funky soul elements, even calling it &quot;shoeshine music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History&quot; track on the &quot;Deep Purple: History and Hits&quot; DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Purple – Stormbringer |work=Coffeerooms on Music |url=http://www.coffeerooms.com/onmusic/2009/04/deep-purple-stormbringer.html |date=1 April 2009 |author=Mike Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview |work=Guitar International |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |author=Steven Rosen |year=1975 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222064521/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |archive-date=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he left the band on 21 June 1975 to form his own band with [[Ronnie James Dio]] of [[Elf (band)|Elf]], called Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, shortened to [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] after the first album.&lt;ref&gt;Dafydd Rees, Luke Crampton (1991).

With Blackmore's departure, Purple had to fill one of the biggest vacancies in rock music. In spite of this, the band refused to stop, and announced a replacement: American [[Tommy Bolin]].

Before he joined Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings had been made as a session musician on [[Billy Cobham]]'s 1973 [[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Spectrum (Billy Cobham album)|Spectrum]]'', and as lead guitarist on two post-[[Joe Walsh]] [[James Gang]] albums: ''[[Bang (James Gang album)|Bang]]'' (1973) and ''[[Miami (James Gang album)|Miami]]'' (1974). He had also jammed with such luminaries as [[Dr. John]], [[Albert King]], [[the Good Rats]], [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] and [[Alphonse Mouzon]], and was busy working on his first solo album, ''[[Teaser (Tommy Bolin album)|Teaser]]'', when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talevski&quot;/&gt;

The resulting album, ''[[Come Taste the Band]]'', was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's ''Teaser'' album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (#19 in the UK and #43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their [[hard rock]] sound.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/g8fd|title=BBC - Music - Review of Deep Purple - Come Taste the Band: 35th Anniversary Edition |first=Greg |last=Moffitt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to manifest themselves. During the ''Come Taste the Band'' tour many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from a cocaine addiction.&lt;ref name=MkIV-story&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc |title=Gettin' Tighter: The Story Of Deep Purple Mk.

After the break-up, most of the past and present members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]], [[Whitesnake]] and [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]. The now-defunct Deep Purple began to gain a type of mystical status, with fan-driven compilations, reissues and live records being released through the remainder of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Purple #4 June 1975-March 1976 |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk4.htm |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fueled a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a [[Bogus Deep Purple|touring version of the band]] surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |year=1998 |work=Captain Beyond website |title=Rod Evans: The Dark Side of the Music Industry |author=Hartmut Kreckel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313204251/http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |archive-date=13 March 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mark II line-up continued, releasing ''[[The House of Blue Light]]'' in 1987, which was followed by a world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air) and another live album ''[[Nobody's Perfect (Deep Purple album)|Nobody's Perfect]]'' (1988) which was culled from several shows on this tour, but still largely based on the by-now familiar ''Made in Japan'' set-list. In the UK a new version of &quot;Hush&quot; (with Gillan on lead vocals) was released to mark 20 years of the band.

Gillan was fired in 1989; his relations with Blackmore had again soured, and their musical differences had diverged too far. Originally, the band intended to recruit [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] frontman [[Jimi Jamison]] as Gillan's replacement, but this fell through owing to complications with [[Scotti Brothers Records]], Jamison's record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;aor.nu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aor.nu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=108 |title=Interview: Jimi Jamison |publisher=aor.nu |accessdate=15 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190412/http://www.aor.nu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=108 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;picturedwithtin.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.picturedwithin.com/interviews/tbro_int.html |title=25 Years of Deep Purple The Battle Rages On...:Interview with Jon Lord |publisher=pictured within.com |accessdate=15 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517061304/http://www.picturedwithin.com/interviews/tbro_int.html |archive-date=17 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, after auditioning several high-profile candidates, including [[Brian Howe (singer)|Brian Howe]] ([[White Spirit (band)|White Spirit]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Bad Company]]), [[Doug Pinnick]] ([[King's X]]), Australians [[Jimmy Barnes]] ([[Cold Chisel]]) and [[John Farnham]] ([[Little River Band]]), Terry Brock (Strangeways, [[Giant (band)|Giant]]) and Norman &quot;Kal&quot; Swan ([[Tytan (band)|Tytan]], [[Lion (band)|Lion]], [[Bad Moon Rising (band)|Bad Moon Rising]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson2004pp259&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story |year=2004 |author=Dave Thompson |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Rainbow vocalist [[Joe Lynn Turner]] was recruited into the band.

With the tour complete, Turner was forced out, as Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanted Gillan back in the fold for the 25th anniversary.

Morse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled ''[[Purpendicular]]'' was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles, though it never made chart success on the Billboard 200 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic.com&quot;/&gt; The Mark VII line-up then released a new live album ''[[Live at The Olympia '96]]'' in 1997.

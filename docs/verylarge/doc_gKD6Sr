The High Sheriff is an ancient county officer, but is now a largely ceremonial post. High Shrievalties are the oldest secular titles under the Crown, in England and Wales. The High Sheriff is the representative of the monarch and is the &quot;Keeper of The Queen's Peace&quot; in the county, executing judgements of the High Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;highsheriffs.com&quot;/&gt;

The Duchy administers ''[[bona vacantia]]'' within the County Palatine, receiving the property of persons who die intestate and where the legal ownership cannot be ascertained. There is no separate [[Duke of Lancaster]]; the title merged into the Crown with the ascension of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Rather, the Duchy is administered by the Queen in Right of the Duchy of Lancaster.  A separate court system for the county palatine was abolished by [[Courts Act 1971]].  A particular form of [[The Loyal Toast]], 'The Queen, Duke of Lancaster' is in regular use in the county palatine. Lancaster serves as the [[county town]] of the county palatine.

It is traditional that when giving the dinner toast to the Queen, in Lancashire only, that the form of words is to 'The Queen, the Duke of Lancaster'. This practice is still upheld within the county where after dinner toasts are made.

==Economy==
[[File:Lancashire County Hall, Preston.jpg|thumb|[[County Hall, Preston]]]]
Lancashire in the 19th century was a major centre of economic activity, and hence one of wealth. Activities included coal mining, textile production, particularly [[cotton]], and fishing. Preston Docks, an industrial port are now disused for commercial purposes. Lancashire was historically the location of the port of [[Liverpool]] while [[Barrow-in-Furness]] is famous for [[shipbuilding]].

As of 2013, the largest private sector industry is the defence industry with [[BAE Systems Military Air Solutions]] division based in [[Warton, Fylde|Warton]] on [[the Fylde]] coast. The division operates a manufacturing site in [[Samlesbury]].

==Education==
{{Main|List of schools in Lancashire}}
Lancashire has a mostly comprehensive system with four state grammar schools. Not including [[sixth form college]]s, there are 77 state schools (not including Burnley's new schools) and 24 independent schools. The Clitheroe area has secondary modern schools. Sixth form provision is limited at most schools in most districts, with only Fylde and Lancaster districts having mostly sixth forms at schools. The rest depend on FE colleges and sixth form colleges, where they exist. South Ribble has the largest school population and Fylde the smallest (only three schools). Burnley's schools have had a new broom and have essentially been knocked down and started again in 2006. There are many Church of England and Catholic faith schools in Lancashire.

Lancashire is home to four universities: [[Lancaster University]], the [[University of Central Lancashire]], [[Edge Hill University]] and the Lancaster campus of the [[University of Cumbria]]. Seven colleges offer higher education courses.

==Transport==

===Road===
[[File:M6 motorway near Carnforth.jpg|thumb|right|The M6 near [[Carnforth]]]]
The Lancashire economy relies strongly on the [[M6 motorway]] which runs from north to south, past Lancaster and Preston. The [[M55 motorway|M55]] connects Preston to Blackpool and is 11.5 miles (18.3&amp;nbsp;km) long. The [[M65 motorway]] from [[Colne]], connects Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn to Preston. The [[M61 motorway|M61]] from Preston via [[Chorley]] and the [[M66 motorway|M66]] starting  {{convert|500|m|mi|1}} inside the county boundary near [[Edenfield]], provide links between Lancashire and Manchester] and the trans-Pennine [[M62 motorway|M62]]. The [[M58 motorway|M58]] crosses the southernmost part of the county from the M6 near Wigan to Liverpool via [[Skelmersdale]].

Other major roads include the eastâ€“west [[A59 road|A59]] between Liverpool in Merseyside and [[Skipton]] in North Yorkshire via Ormskirk, Preston and Clitheroe, and the connecting [[A565 road|A565]] to [[Southport]]; the [[A56 road|A56]] from [[Ramsbottom]] to [[Padiham]] via [[Haslingden]] and from Colne to Skipton; the [[A585 road|A585]] from [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] to [[Fleetwood]]; the [[A666 road|A666]] from the A59 north of Blackburn to Bolton via [[Darwen]]; and the A683 from [[Heysham]] to [[Kirkby Lonsdale]] via Lancaster.

==Demography==
{{see also|List of settlements in Lancashire by population}}
The major settlements in the ceremonial county are concentrated on [[the Fylde]] coast (the [[Blackpool Urban Area]]), and a belt of towns running westâ€“east along the [[M65 motorway|M65]]: [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Blackburn]], [[Accrington]], [[Burnley]], [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]] and [[Colne]]. South of Preston are the towns of [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] and [[Chorley]]; the three formed part of the [[Central Lancashire]] New Town designated in 1970. The north of the county is predominantly rural and sparsely populated, except for the towns of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Morecambe]] which form a large conurbation of almost 100,000 people. Lancashire is home to a significant [[British Asian|Asian]] population, numbering over 70,000 and 6% of the county's population, and concentrated largely in the former cotton mill towns in the south east.

Boundary changes to occur before 1974 include:&lt;ref name=Youngs /&gt;

*[[Todmorden]] (split between Lancashire and Yorkshire) entirely to West Riding of Yorkshire in 1889
*[[Mossley]] (split between Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire) entirely to Lancashire in 1889
*[[Stalybridge]], entirely to Cheshire in 1889
*the former county boroughs of Manchester and Warrington both extended south of the Mersey into historic Cheshire (areas such as [[Wythenshawe]] and [[Latchford]])
*correspondingly, the former county borough of Stockport extended north into [[Lancashire County Palatine|historic Lancashire]], including areas such as [[Reddish]] and the [[Four Heatons|Heatons]] ([[Heaton Chapel]], [[Heaton Mersey]], [[Heaton Moor]] and [[Heaton Norris]]).

==Symbols==
[[File:Red Rose Badge of Lancaster.svg|thumb|upright|right|The Red Rose of Lancaster]]
The [[Red Rose of Lancaster]] is the [[county flower]] found on the county's heraldic badge and flag. The rose was a symbol of the [[House of Lancaster]], immortalised in the verse &quot;In the battle for England's head/[[House of York|York]] was white, Lancaster red&quot; (referring to the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]). The traditional Lancashire flag, a red rose on a white field, was not officially registered. When an attempt was made to register it with the [[Flag Institute]] it was found that it was officially registered by [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] in Scotland, several hundred years earlier with the [[Lyon Office]]. [[Flag of Lancashire|Lancashire's official flag]] is registered as a red rose on a gold field.

==Sport==

===Cricket===
[[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] has been one of the most successful [[county cricket]] teams, particularly in the [[one-day cricket|one-day]] game. It is home to [[England cricket team]] members [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Jos Buttler]]. The [[County Ground, Old Trafford]], [[Trafford]] has been the home cricket ground of LCCC since 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=contact |title=LCCC contact details |publisher=Lccc.co.uk |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924003212/http://lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=contact |archive-date=24 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically important local cricket leagues include the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]], the [[Central Lancashire League]] and the [[North Lancashire and Cumbria League]], all of which were formed in 1892. These league clubs hire international professional players to play alongside their amateur players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

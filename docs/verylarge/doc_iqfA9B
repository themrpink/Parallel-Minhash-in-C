===Sources===
Lapis lazuli is found in limestone in the [[Kokcha River]] valley of [[Badakhshan]] province in northeastern Afghanistan, where the [[Sar-e-Sang]] mine deposits have been worked for more than 6,000 years.&lt;ref name=co2003&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Oldershaw|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Mesopotamians, as part of [[Egypt–Mesopotamia relations]]. During the height of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], approximately 2000 BCE, the Harappan colony, now known as [[Shortugai]], was established near the lapis mines.&lt;ref name=bc1995/&gt;

According to the [[Sorbonne]]'s mineralogist Pierre Bariand's leading work on the sources of lapis lazuli in modern times, and to references in ''Afghanistan's Blue Treasure: Lapis Lazuli'' (2011) by Lailee McNair Bakhtiar, the lapis lazuli is found in &quot;caves&quot; not traditionally considered &quot;mines&quot; and the stone lapis lazuli is from the primary source of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan's Kochka River Valley and not in Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the [[Andes]] (near [[Ovalle, Chile|Ovalle]], [[Chile]]); and to the west of [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui Lazurite deposit.  It is mined in smaller amounts in [[Angola]], Argentina, [[Burma]], Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in [[California]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=CGA/&gt;

===Uses and substitutes===
Lapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewelry, carvings, boxes, [[mosaic]]s, ornaments, small statues, and vases. During the [[Renaissance]], lapis was ground and processed to make the [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]] for use in [[fresco]]es and [[oil painting]]. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available.

Lapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gilson process, which is used to make artificial [[ultramarine]] and hydrous zinc phosphates.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Peter (2005).

Quantities of these beads have also been found at 4th millennium BCE settlements in Northern [[Mesopotamia]], and at the [[Bronze Age]] site of [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]] in southeast Iran (3rd millennium BCE). A dagger with a lapis handle, a bowl inlaid with lapis, amulets, beads, and inlays representing eyebrows and beards, were found in the Royal Tombs of the Sumerian city-state of [[Ur]] from the 3rd Millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moorey 1999 86–87&quot;/&gt;

Lapis was also used in ancient Mesopotamia by the [[Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonians]] for [[Cylinder seal|seals]] and jewelry. It is mentioned several times in the Mesopotamian poem, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (17th–18th Century BCE), one of the oldest known works of literature. The [[Statue of Ebih-Il]], a 3rd millennium BCE statue found in the ancient city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in modern-day [[Syria]], now in the [[Louvre]], uses lapis lazuli inlays for the irises of the eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;louvre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ebih-il-superintendent-mari|title=Ebih-Il, the Superintendent of Mari|last=Claire|first=Iselin|publisher=[[Musée du Louvre]]|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]]. Lapis jewelry has been found at excavations of the [[Predynastic Egypt]]ian site [[Naqada]] (3300–3100 BCE). At [[Karnak]], the relief carvings of [[Thutmose III]] (1479-1429 BCE) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute. Powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by [[Cleopatra]].&lt;ref name=bc1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/cleopatra-wear-makeup/] Moment of Science site, Indiana Public Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewelry made of lapis lazuli has also been found at [[Mycenae]] attesting to relations between the Myceneans and the developed civilizations of Egypt and the East.&lt;ref&gt;Alcestis Papademetriou, ''Mycenae'', John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation, 2015, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that lapis lazuli is “opaque and sprinkled with specks of gold”.&amp;nbsp; Because the stone combines the blue of the heavens and golden glitter of the sun, it was emblematic of success in the old Jewish tradition. In the early Christian tradition lapis lazuli was regarded as the stone of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].

In late classical times and as late as the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli was often called [[sapphire]] (''sapphirus'' in Latin, ''sappir'' in Hebrew),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schumann | first = Walter | others = trans. Annette Englander &amp; Daniel Shea | title = Gemstones of the World | origyear = 2002 | edition = Newly revised &amp; expanded 3rd | year = 2006 | publisher = Sterling | location = New York | page = 102 | chapter = Sapphire | quote =In antiquity and as late as the Middle Ages, the name sapphire was understood to mean what is today described as lapis lazuli.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it had little to do with the stone today known as the blue [[corundum]] variety sapphire.  In his book on stones, the Greek scientist Theophrastus described &quot;the sapphirus, which is speckled with gold,&quot; a description which matches lapis lazuli.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, ''On Stones'' (De Lapidibus) – IV-23, translated by D.E. Eichholtz, Oxford University Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many references to sapphires in the [[Old Testament]], but most scholars agree that, since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: &quot;And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone...&quot; (KJV). The term used in the Latin Vulgate Bible in this citation is &quot;lapidus sapphiri&quot;, the term for lapis lazuli.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlie Braswell-Tripp (2013), ''Real Diamonds and Precious Stones of the Bible'' {{ISBN|978-1-4797-9644-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern translations of the Bible, such as the New Living Translation Second Edition,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In His Image Devotional Bible&quot; {{ISBN|978-1-4143-3763-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to lapis lazuli in most instances instead of sapphire.

[[File:Metis moon.jpg|thumb|Metis imaged by [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] on 4 January 2000]]

'''Metis''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|t|ᵻ|s}}, also known as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter XVI}}''', is the [[Jupiter's inner moons|innermost]] known [[moon of Jupiter]]. It was discovered in 1979 in images taken by ''[[Voyager 1]]'', and was named in 1983 after the first wife of Zeus, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]. Additional observations made between early 1996 and September 2003 by the [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] allowed its surface to be imaged.

Metis is [[tidally locked]] to [[Jupiter]], and its shape is strongly asymmetrical, with one of the diameters being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It is also one of the two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being [[Adrastea (moon)|Adrastea]]. It orbits within the [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|main ring of Jupiter]], and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the [[rings of Jupiter|rings]].

== Discovery and observations ==

Metis was discovered in 1979 by [[Stephen P. Synnott]] in images taken by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' probe and was [[provisional designation|provisionally designated]] as '''{{nowrap|S/1979 J 3}}'''.{{sfn|IAUC 3507}}{{sfn|Synnott|1981}} In 1983 it was officially named after the mythological [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], a [[Titan (mythology)|Titaness]] who was the first wife of [[Zeus]] (the [[Greek mythology|Greek equivalent]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]).{{sfn|IAUC 3872}} The photographs taken by ''Voyager 1'' showed Metis only as a dot, and hence knowledge about Metis was very limited until the arrival of the [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]]. ''Galileo'' imaged almost all of the surface of Metis and put constraints on its composition by 1998.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

Although the ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'' orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called [[JunoCam]], it is almost entirely focused on observations of Jupiter itself. During close observations of Jupiter, it may capture some distant images of the innermost moons Metis and [[Adrastea (moon)|Adrastea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P41B2066H]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

Metis has an irregular shape and measures 60&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;40&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;34&amp;nbsp;km across, which makes it the second smallest of the four [[inner satellites of Jupiter]].{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]] (~0.86&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}} its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a [[porosity]] of 10–15%.{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}}

The surface of Metis is heavily cratered, dark, and appears to be reddish in color. There is a substantial asymmetry between leading and trailing [[Sphere|hemispheres]]: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.{{sfn|Simonelli Rossier et al.|2000}}

== Orbit and rotation ==
Metis is the innermost of Jupiter's four small [[inner satellites of Jupiter|inner moon]]s. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of ~128,000&amp;nbsp;km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter's [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|main ring]]. Metis's orbit has very small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] (~0.0002) and [[inclination]] (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.{{sfn|Evans Porco et al.|2002}}{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

Due to [[tidal locking]], Metis rotates synchronously with its orbital period (about 7 hours), with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}

Metis lies inside Jupiter's [[synchronous orbit]] radius (as does [[Adrastea (moon)|Adrastea]]), and as a result, [[tidal deceleration|tidal force]]s slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid [[Roche limit]]; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

Metis is the fastest-moving of Jupiter's moons. It orbits Jupiter at 31.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.{{efn|name=calculated}}

Jupiter casts a shadow on all of Metis for 68 minutes each Metian day.{{efn|name=calculated}}

== Relationship with Jupiter's rings ==
[[File:PIA09921 Shepherd Moons.gif|thumb|Metis orbiting at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring, as imaged by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft on 24 February 2007]]

Metis's orbit lies ~1000&amp;nbsp;km within the main ring of Jupiter. It orbits within a ~500&amp;nbsp;km wide &quot;gap&quot; or &quot;notch&quot; in the ring.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}{{sfn|Ockert-Bell Burns et al.|1999}} The gap is clearly somehow related to the moon but the origin of this connection has not been established. Metis supplies a significant part of the main ring's dust.{{sfn|Burns Showalter et al.|1999}} This material appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|Jupiter's four small inner satellites]] by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from the satellites into space because the satellites' surfaces lie fairly close to the edge of their [[Roche sphere]]s due to their low density.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}

[[File:Retrato de Domenico Scarlatti.jpg|thumb|Domenico Scarlatti in a portrait by [[Domingo Antonio Velasco]] (1738)]]

'''Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti''', also known as '''Domingo''' or '''Doménico Scarlatti'''; ([[Naples]] 26 October 1685{{spaced ndash}} [[Madrid]], 23 July 1757) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[composer]]. He is classified primarily as a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical style]]. Like his renowned father [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|his 555 keyboard sonatas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Ralph |title=Domenico Scarlatti |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Domenico-Scarlatti |website=Encyclopedia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his life in the service of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] royal families.

==Life and career ==
Domenico Scarlatti was born in [[Naples]], [[Kingdom of Naples]], belonging to the [[Spanish Crown]]. He was born in 1685, the same year as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Ralph |title=Domenico Scarlatti |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Domenico-Scarlatti |website=Encyclopedia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlatti was the sixth of ten children of the composer and teacher [[Alessandro Scarlatti]]. His older brother [[Pietro Filippo Scarlatti|Pietro Filippo]] was also a musician.

Scarlatti first studied music under his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Domenico Scarlatti |url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Domenico-Scarlatti/Composer/10743-1 |website=ArkivMusic: the source for classical music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other composers who may have been his early teachers include [[Gaetano Greco]], [[Francesco Gasparini]], and [[Bernardo Pasquini]], all of whom may have influenced his musical style. [[Muzio Clementi]] brought Scarlatti's sonatas into the classical style by editing what is known to be its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldo |first1=Laura |title=The development of the idiomatic piano language through Clementi's edition of D. Scarlatti's sonatas (1791) |journal=Anuario Musical |volume=72 |pages=123–136 |url=https://doaj.org/article/b5d8339e5d03424685bcb8b897d4926f}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed as composer and [[organist]] at the royal chapel in Naples in 1701. In 1703, he revised [[Carlo Francesco Pollarolo]]'s opera ''Irene'' for performance at Naples. Soon afterward, his father sent him to [[Venice]]. After this, nothing is known of Scarlatti's life until 1709, when he went to [[Rome]] and entered the service of the exiled Polish queen [[Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien|Marie Casimire]]. It was in Rome that he met [[Thomas Roseingrave]]. Scarlatti was already an accomplished [[harpsichord]]ist: there is a story of a trial of skill with [[George Frideric Handel]] at the palace of [[Pietro Ottoboni (cardinal)|Cardinal Ottoboni]] in Rome where he was judged possibly superior to Handel on the [[harpsichord]], although inferior on the [[organ (music)|organ]]. Scarlatti has been heralded as the &quot;greatest Italian harpsichord composer of all time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Barkley |editor1-first=Lisa |editor2-last=Bryan |editor2-first=Clark |title=Conservatory Canada New Millennium Piano Series |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Scarlatti was known to cross himself in veneration when speaking of Handel's skill. While in Rome, Scarlatti composed several operas for Queen Casimire's private theatre. He was ''Maestro di Cappella'' at St. Peter's from 1715 to 1719. In 1719 he traveled to London to direct his opera ''[[Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura|Narciso]]'' at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]].

According to Vicente Bicchi, [[Nuncio|Papal Nuncio]] in Portugal at the time, Domenico Scarlatti arrived in [[Lisbon]] on 29 November 1719. There he taught music to the Portuguese princess [[Barbara of Portugal|Maria Magdalena Barbara]]. He left Lisbon on 28 January 1727 for Rome, where he married Maria Caterina Gentili on 6 May 1728. In 1729 he moved to [[Seville]], staying for four years. In 1733 he went to Madrid as a music master to Princess Maria Barbara, who had married into the Spanish royal house. The Princess later became Queen of Spain. Scarlatti remained in the country for the remaining twenty-five years of his life and had five children there. After the death of his first wife in 1739, he married a Spaniard, Anastasia Maxarti Ximenes. Among his compositions during his time in Madrid were most of the 555 keyboard sonatas for which he is best known.

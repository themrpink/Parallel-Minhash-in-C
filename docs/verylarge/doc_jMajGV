Wafers grown using materials other than silicon will have different thicknesses than a silicon wafer of the same diameter. Wafer thickness is determined by the [[mechanical strength]] of the material used; the wafer must be thick enough to support its own weight without cracking during handling. The tabulated thicknesses relate to when that process was introduced, and are not necessarily correct currently, for example the IBM BiCMOS7WL process is on 8 in wafers, but these are only 200um thick. The weight of the wafer goes up along with its thickness and diameter.

==== Historical increases of wafer size ====
A unit [[wafer fabrication]] step, such as an etch step, can produce more chips proportional to the increase in wafer area, while the cost of the unit fabrication step goes up more slowly than the wafer area. This was the cost basis for increasing wafer size. Conversion to 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers from 200&amp;nbsp;mm wafers began in earnest in 2000, and reduced the price per die about 30-40%.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undeveloped.com/buy-domain/semiconductor.net?redirected=true&amp;tld=net|title=semiconductor.net - Domain Name For Sale|last=Undeveloped|date=|website=Undeveloped}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger diameter wafers allow for more die per wafer.

==== Photovoltaic ====
{{expand section|date=July 2020}}
M1 wafer size (156.75 mm) is in process of phase-out in China as of 2020. A number of nonstandard sizes has arisen, so efforts to produce M10 standard (182 mm) is an ongoing effort.  Like semiconductor cousin, driving down costs is main driver despite that purity requirements are completely different.

=== Proposed 450 mm transition ===

There is considerable resistance to the 450&amp;nbsp;mm transition despite the possible productivity improvement, because of concern about insufficient return on investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; There are also issues related to increased inter-die / edge-to-edge wafer variation and additional edge defects. 450mm wafers are expected to cost 4 times as much as 300mm wafers, and equipment costs are expected to rise by 20 to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eetimes.com/collaborative-advantage-design-impact-of-450mm-transition/&lt;/ref&gt; Higher cost semiconductor fabrication equipment for larger wafers increases the cost of 450&amp;nbsp;mm fabs (semiconductor fabrication facilities or factories). Lithographer [[Chris Mack (scientist)|Chris Mack]] claimed in 2012 that the overall price per die for 450&amp;nbsp;mm wafers would be reduced by only 10–20% compared to 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers, because over 50% of total wafer processing costs are lithography-related. Converting to larger 450&amp;nbsp;mm wafers would reduce price per die only for process operations such as etch where cost is related to wafer count, not wafer area. Cost for processes such as lithography is proportional to wafer area, and larger wafers would not reduce the lithography contribution to die cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://life.lithoguru.com/index.php?itemid=253|title=Lithoguru {{!}} Musings of a Gentleman Scientist|website=life.lithoguru.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikon planned to deliver 450-mm lithography equipment in 2015, with volume production in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikon 2014-05-20&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Nikon appointing head of precision equipment business as new president |location=Japan |publisher=Nikon Corp. |agency=semiconportal |date=2014-05-20 |quote=Nikon plans to introduce 450mm wafer lithography systems for volume production in 2017. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikon 2013-09-13&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=LaPedus |first=Mark |url=http://semiengineering.com/litho-roadmap-remains-cloudy/ |title=Litho Roadmap Remains Cloudy |work=semiengineering.com |publisher=Sperling Media Group LLC |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |quote=Nikon planned to ship 'early learning tools' by 2015.

The timeline for 450&amp;nbsp;mm has not been fixed. In 2012, it was expected that 450mm production would start in 2017, which never realized.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eetimes.com/first-450-mm-fabs-to-ramp-in-2017-says-analyst/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eetimes.com/construction-of-450mm-fab-well-underway/&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Durcan, then CEO of [[Micron Technology]], said in February 2014 that he expects 450&amp;nbsp;mm adoption to be delayed indefinitely or discontinued. &quot;I am not convinced that 450mm will ever happen but, to the extent that it does, it’s a long way out in the future. There is not a lot of necessity for Micron, at least over the next five years, to be spending a lot of money on 450mm. There is a lot of investment that needs to go on in the equipment community to make that happen. And the value at the end of the day – so that customers would buy that equipment – I think is dubious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/mannerisms/manufacturing/6706-2014-02/|title=450mm May Never Happen, says Micron CEO|author=|date=11 February 2014|website=electronicsweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2014, Intel Corporation expected 450&amp;nbsp;mm deployment by 2020 (by the end of this decade).&lt;ref name=&quot;intel450mm&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.timesunion.com/business/intel-says-450mm-will-deploy-later-in-decade/59430/ | title = Intel says 450&amp;nbsp;mm will deploy later in decade |date=2014-03-18 | accessdate = 2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark LaPedus of semiengineering.com reported in mid-2014 that chipmakers had delayed adoption of 450&amp;nbsp;mm &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot; According to this report some observers expected 2018 to 2020, while G. Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSI Research, didn't see 450mm fabs moving into production until 2020 to 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=LaPedus |first=Mark |url=http://semiengineering.com/is-450mm-dead-in-the-water/ |title=Is 450mm Dead In The Water? |work=semiengineering.com |location=California |publisher=Sperling Media Group LLC |date=2014-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605134348/http://semiengineering.com/is-450mm-dead-in-the-water/ |archivedate=2014-06-05 |accessdate=2014-06-04 |quote=Intel and the rest of the industry have delayed the shift to 450&amp;nbsp;mm fabs for the foreseeable future, leaving many to ponder the following question—Is 450&amp;nbsp;mm technology dead in the water? The answer: 450&amp;nbsp;mm is currently treading water. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The step up to 300&amp;nbsp;mm required major changes, with [[automatic factory|fully automated factories]] using 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers versus barely automated factories for the 200&amp;nbsp;mm wafers, partly because a [[FOUP]] for 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers weighs about 7.5 kilograms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shinpoly.co.jp/english/product/semiconductor/seimitsu/300gt.html|title=MW 300GT &amp;#124; Wafer Cases &amp;#124; Shin-Etsu Polymer Co., Ltd|website=www.shinpoly.co.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; when loaded with 25 300&amp;nbsp;mm wafers where a [[SMIF (interface)|SMIF]] weighs about 4.8 kilograms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ckplas.com/nen/wafer_smif_pod_8.htm|title=SMIF Pod-Chung King Enterprise Co., Ltd.|website=www.ckplas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ckplas.com/nen/ppcst_8_open.htm|title=Wafer Cassette-Chung King Enterprise Co., Ltd.|website=www.ckplas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; when loaded with 25 200&amp;nbsp;mm wafers, thus requiring twice the amount of physical strength from factory workers, and increasing fatigue. 300mm FOUPs have handles so that they can be still be moved by hand. 450mm FOUPs weigh 45 kilograms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://450mm.com/blog/2013/04/07/standing-out-from-the-crowd/|title=Standing out from the Crowd on 450mm &amp;#124; 450mm News and Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; when loaded with 25 450&amp;nbsp;mm wafers, thus cranes are necessary to manually handle the FOUPs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-square.com/O_Ergolifts.html|title=H-Square Ergolift Cleanroom Lift Carts|website=www.h-square.com|access-date=2019-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527012153/http://www.h-square.com/O_Ergolifts.html|archive-date=2019-05-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and handles are no longer present in the FOUP. FOUPs are moved around using material handling systems from [[Muratec]] or [[Daifuku (company)|Daifuku]].  These major investments were undertaken in the [[economic downturn]] following the [[dot-com bubble]], resulting in huge resistance to upgrading to 450&amp;nbsp;mm by the original timeframe. On the ramp up to 450&amp;nbsp;mm are that the crystal ingots will be 3 times heavier (total weight a metric ton) and take 2–4 times longer to cool, and the process time will be double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undeveloped.com/buy-domain/semiconductor.net?redirected=true&amp;tld=net|title=semiconductor.net - Domain Name For Sale|last=Undeveloped|website=Undeveloped|access-date=2018-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821040334/https://undeveloped.com/buy-domain/semiconductor.net?redirected=true&amp;tld=net|archive-date=2018-08-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; All told, the development of 450&amp;nbsp;mm wafers requires significant engineering, time, and cost to overcome.

=== Analytical die count estimation ===

In order to minimize the cost per [[die (integrated circuit)|die]], manufacturers wish to maximize the number of dies that can be made from a single wafer; dies always have a square or rectangular shape due to the constraint of [[wafer dicing]]. In general, this is a [[Computational complexity theory|computationally complex]] problem with no analytical solution, dependent on both the area of the dies as well as their [[aspect ratio]] (square or rectangular) and other considerations such as the width of the [[Die preparation#Semiconductor-die cutting|scribeline]] or saw lane, and additional space occupied by alignment and test structures. Note that gross DPW formulas account only for wafer area that is lost because it cannot be used to make physically complete dies; gross DPW calculations do ''not'' account for yield loss due to defects or parametric issues.

[[File:Wafermap showing fully and partially patterned dies.svg|thumb|Wafermap showing fully patterned dies, and partially patterned dies which don't fully lie within the wafer.]]

Nevertheless, the number of gross die per wafer ('''DPW''') can be estimated starting with the [[first-order approximation]] or wafer-to-die area ratio,
:&lt;math&gt;DPW = \left\lfloor\frac{\pi d^2}{4S}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the wafer diameter (typically in mm) and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the size of each die (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) including the width of the scribeline ( or in the case of a saw lane, the [[kerf]] plus a tolerance). This formula simply states that the number of dies which can fit on the wafer [[pigeonhole principle|cannot exceed]] the area of the wafer divided by the area of each individual die. It will always overestimate the true best-case gross DPW, since it includes the area of partially patterned dies which do not fully lie on the wafer surface (see figure). These partially patterned dies don't represent complete [[integrated circuit|IC]]s, so they cannot be sold as functional parts.

Refinements of this simple formula typically add an edge correction, to account for partial dies on the edge, which in general will be more significant when the area of the die is large compared to the total area of the wafer. In the other limiting case (infinitesimally small dies or infinitely large wafers), the edge correction is negligible.

The correction factor or correction term generally takes one of the forms cited by De Vries:&lt;ref name=&quot;devries&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigation of gross die per wafer formulas|author1=Dirk K. de Vries|journal=IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing|volume=18|issue=February 2005|pages=136–139|doi=10.1109/TSM.2004.836656|year=2005|s2cid=32016975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;DPW = \frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S} - \frac{\displaystyle \pi d}{\sqrt{2S}}&lt;/math&gt; (area ratio - circumference/(die diagonal length))
:or &lt;math&gt;DPW = \left(\frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S}\right) \exp(-2 \sqrt{S}/d)&lt;/math&gt; (area ratio scaled by an exponential factor)
:or &lt;math&gt;DPW = \frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S} \left(1 - \frac{\displaystyle 2\sqrt{S}}{d} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt; (area ratio scaled by a polynomial factor).

Studies comparing these analytical formulas to [[brute-force search|brute-force]] computational results show that the formulas can be made more accurate, over practical ranges of die sizes and aspect ratios, by adjusting the coefficients of the corrections to values above or below unity, and by replacing the linear die dimension &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{S}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(H+W)/2&lt;/math&gt; (average side length) in the case of dies with large aspect ratio:&lt;ref name=&quot;devries&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;DPW = \frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S} - 0.58^{*} \frac{\displaystyle \pi d}{\sqrt{S}}&lt;/math&gt;
:or &lt;math&gt;DPW = \left(\frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S}\right) \exp(-2.32^{*} \sqrt{S}/d)&lt;/math&gt;
:or &lt;math&gt;DPW = \frac{\displaystyle \pi d^2}{4S} \left(1 - \frac{\displaystyle 1.16^{*} \sqrt{S}}{d} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Crystalline orientation ===

[[File:Silicon-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|thumb|Diamond cubic crystal structure of a silicon unit cell]]
[[File:Wafer flats convention v2.svg|thumb|Flats can be used to denote [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] and [[crystallography|crystallographic]] orientation. Red represents material that has been removed.]]

Wafers are grown from crystal having a regular [[crystal structure]], with silicon having a [[diamond cubic]] structure with a lattice spacing of 5.430710 Å (0.5430710&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=HandbookSi&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Mara |first=William C. |year=1990|title=Handbook of Semiconductor Silicon Technology |pages =349–352 |publisher=William Andrew Inc. |isbn=978-0-8155-1237-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COcVgAtqeKkC&amp;q=Czochralski+Silicon+Crystal+Face+Cubic&amp;pg=PA351 |accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When cut into wafers, the surface is aligned in one of several relative directions known as crystal orientations. Orientation is defined by the [[Miller index]] with (100) or (111) faces being the most common for silicon.&lt;ref name=HandbookSi/&gt;
Orientation is important since many of a single crystal's structural and electronic properties are highly [[anisotropic]]. [[Ion implantation]] depths depend on the wafer's crystal orientation, since each direction offers distinct [[Ion implantation#Ion channelling|paths]] for transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nishi |first=Yoshio |year=2000 |title=Handbook of Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology |pages=108–109 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-8783-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi98H-iTgLEC&amp;q=wafer+flat+and+notch&amp;pg=PA70 |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wafer [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] typically occurs only in a few well-defined directions. Scoring the wafer along cleavage planes allows it to be easily diced into individual chips (&quot;[[Die (integrated circuit)|die]]s&quot;) so that the billions of individual [[Electronic component|circuit elements]] on an average wafer can be separated into many individual circuits.

=== Crystallographic orientation notches ===

Wafers under 200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter have ''flats'' cut into one or more sides indicating the [[crystallography|crystallographic]] planes of the wafer (usually a {110} face). In earlier-generation wafers a pair of flats at different angles additionally conveyed the doping type (see illustration for conventions). Wafers of 200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and above use a single small notch to convey wafer orientation, with no visual indication of doping type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wafer Flats |url=http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/elmat_en/kap_5/illustr/i5_2_4.html |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impurity doping ===

Silicon wafers are generally not 100% pure silicon, but are instead formed with an initial impurity [[Doping (semiconductors)|doping]] concentration between 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; atoms per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of [[boron]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] which is added to the melt and defines the wafer as either bulk n-type or p-type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Widmann |first=Dietrich |year=2000 |title=Technology of Integrated Circuits |pages=39 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-66199-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYNn1N6YSwQC&amp;q=Czochralski+Doping+Silicon&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared with single-crystal silicon's atomic density of 5×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; atoms per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, this still gives a purity greater than 99.9999%. The wafers can also be initially provided with some [[interstitial defect|interstitial]] oxygen concentration. Carbon and metallic contamination are kept to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Microelectronic Materials and Processes |last=Levy |first=Roland Albert |year=1989 |pages=6–7, 13 |isbn=978-0-7923-0154-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZPRPU6ne7UC&amp;pg=PA248 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transition metal]]s, in particular, must be kept below parts per billion concentrations for electronic applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Materials Science of Semiconductors|last=Rockett |first=Angus |year=2008 |pages=13 |isbn=978-0-387-25653-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compound semiconductors ==

While silicon is the prevalent material for wafers used in the electronics industry, other [[compound semiconductor|compound]] [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V]] or [[List of semiconductor materials|II-VI]] materials have also been employed.  [[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs), a [[III-V semiconductor]] produced via the [[Czochralski process]], [[Gallium nitride]] (GaN) and [[Silicon carbide]] (SiC), are also common wafer materials, with GaN and Sapphire being extensively used in [[LED]] manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Grover&gt;{{cite book |title=Microelectronic Materials |last=Grovenor |first= C. |year= 1989 |isbn=978-0-85274-270-9 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=113–123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ecl_mnz1xcUC&amp;q=GaAs+Wafer+Manufacture&amp;pg=PA122 |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WAIS did not adhere to either the standard nor its [[OSI Model|OSI framework]] (adopting instead TCP/IP) but created a unique protocol inspired by Z39.50:1988.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
The WAIS protocol and servers were promoted by [[Thinking Machines Corporation]] (TMC) of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. TMC-produced WAIS servers ran on their massively parallel CM-2 ([[Connection Machine]]) and [[SPARC]]-based CM-5 MP [[supercomputer]]s. WAIS clients were developed for various [[operating system]]s and [[windowing system]]s including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS|Macintosh]], [[NeXT]], [[X Window System|X]], [[GNU Emacs]], and character terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Inspired by the WAIS project on full-text databases and emerging [[SGML]] projects, Z39.50 version 2 (Z39.50:1992) was released. Unlike its 1988 predecessor, it was a compatible superset of the international ISO 10162/10163 standard.

With the advent of Z39.50:1992, the termination of support for free WAIS by Thinking Machines and the establishment of WAIS Inc as a commercial venture, the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] funded the [[Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval]] (CNIDR) to promote Internet search and discovery systems, open source and standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ulrich Pfeifer and Norbert Gövert of the computer science department of the [[University of Dortmund]] extended the CNIDR freeWAIS code to become freeWAIS-'''sf''' with '''s'''tructured '''f'''ields as its main improvement. Ulrich Pfeifer rewrote freeWAIS-sf in [[Perl]], becoming WAIT.

Inspired by WAIS' &quot;Directory of Servers&quot;, [[Eliot Christian]] of [[USGS]] envisioned GILS: [[Government Information Locator Service]]. GILS (based upon Z39.50:1992 with some extensions) became a U.S. Federal mandate as part of the [[Paperwork Reduction Act|Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995]] ({{usc|44|3511}}).

==Directory of Servers==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Thinking Machines Corp provided a service called the Directory of Servers. It was a WAIS server like any other information source except containing information about the other WAIS servers on the Internet. A WAIS server with TMC WAIS code creates a special record containing [[metadata]] plus some common words describing its indexed content. The record is uploaded to the central server and indexed along with the records from other public servers. The directory can be searched to find servers that might have content relevant to a specific field of interest. This model of searching for (WAIS) servers to search became the model for [[Government Information Locator Service|GILS]] and Peter Deutsch's [[WHOIS++]] [[Distributed computing|distributed]] [[white pages]] [[directory service|directory]].

==People==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Two of the developers of WAIS, [[Brewster Kahle]] and Harry Morris, left Thinking Machines to found WAIS Inc in Menlo Park, California with [[Bruce Gilliat]]. WAIS Inc. was originally a joint project between Apple Computer, Peat Markwick, Dow Jones, and Thinking Machines. In 1992, the presidential campaign of [[Ross Perot]] used the WAIS product as a campaign wide information system, connecting the field offices to the national office. Later, [[Perot Systems]] adopted WAIS to better access the information in its corporate databases. Other early clients were the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Library of Congress]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and later the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

WAIS Inc was sold to [[AOL]] in May 1995 for $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tidbits.com/article/1459|title=AOL Buys Everyone|website=tidbits.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale, Margaret St. Pierre left WAIS Inc to start Blue Angel Technologies. Her WAIS variant formed the basis of MetaStar. Georgios Papadopoulos left to found [[Atypon]]. François Schiettecatte left [[Human Genome Project]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] and started FS-Consult and developed his own variant of WAIS which eventually became ScienceServer, which was later sold to [[Elsevier Science]]. Kahle and Gilliat went on to found the [[Internet Archive]] and [[Alexa Internet]].

==WAIS and Gopher==
Public WAIS is often used as a full-text [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] for individual [[Internet Gopher]] servers, supplementing the popular [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]] system which only searches the menu titles of Gopher sites. WAIS and Gopher share the [[World Wide Web]]'s client–server architecture and a certain amount of its functionality. The WAIS protocol is influenced largely by the z39.50 protocol designed for networking library catalogs. It allows a text-based search, and retrieval following a search. Gopher provides a free text search mechanism, but principally uses menus. A menu is a list of titles, from which the user may pick one. While [[Gopher Space]] is a web containing many loops, the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Berners-Lee, Tim. &quot;The World-Wide Web&quot;. ''The New Media Reader''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer Applications In Business|last=Parameswaran|publisher=S. Chand Publisher|year=2008|isbn=978-8121912006|location=https://books.google.ca/books?id=og0rDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Gopher+Space#v=snippet&amp;q=Gopher%20Space&amp;f=false|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Web's data model is similar to the gopher model, except that menus are generalized to hypertext documents. In both cases, simple file servers generate the menus or hypertext directly from the file structure of a server. The Web's hypertext model permits the author more freedom to communicate the options available to the reader, as it can include headings and various forms of list structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], a '''Warner exemption''' is a statutory exemption pertaining to the acquisition of telecommunications systems that meet the exclusionary criteria of the [[Warner Amendment]], Public Law 97-86, 1 December 1981, which is also known as the Brooks Bill.  

Use of [[FTS2000]] by U.S. Government agencies is mandatory when telecommunications are required. However, the Warner Amendment excludes the mandatory use of FTS2000 in instances related to maximum [[security]].

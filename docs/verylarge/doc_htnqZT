Historically, [[fingerprint]]s have been used as the most authoritative method of authentication, but court cases in the US and elsewhere have raised fundamental doubts about fingerprint reliability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/225333.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the legal system as well, fingerprints have been shown to be easily [[spoofing attack|spoof]]able, with [[British Telecom]]'s top computer-security official noting that &quot;few&quot; fingerprint readers have not already been tricked by one spoof or another.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/30/german_interior_minister_fingerprint_appropriated   ''The Register'', UK; Dan Goodin; 30 March 2008; ''Get your German Interior Minister's fingerprint, here''.

In a computer data context, cryptographic methods have been developed (''see'' [[digital signature]] and [[challenge-response authentication]]) which are currently{{When|date=December 2016}} not spoofable '''if and only if''' the originator's key has not been compromised. That the originator (or anyone other than an [[Adversary (cryptography)|attacker]]) knows (or doesn't know) about a compromise is irrelevant. It is not known whether these cryptographically based authentication methods are provably secure, since unanticipated mathematical developments may make them vulnerable to attack in future. If that were to occur, it may call into question much of the authentication in the past. In particular, a [[digital signature|digitally signed]] [[legal instrument|contract]] may be questioned when a new attack on the cryptography underlying the signature is discovered.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Authorization==
{{Main|Authorization}}

The process of [[authorization]] is distinct from that of authentication. Whereas authentication is the process of verifying that &quot;you are who you say you are&quot;, and verifying that &quot;you are permitted to do what you are trying to do&quot;. While authorization often happens immediately after authentication (e.g., when logging into a computer system), this does not mean authorization presupposes authentication: an anonymous agent could be authorized to a limited action set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff687018.aspx |title=Best Practices for Creating a Secure Guest Account |accessdate=2017-11-06 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107060852/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff687018.aspx |archivedate=2017-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access control==
{{Main|Access control}}

One familiar use of authentication and authorization is [[access control]]. A computer system that is supposed to be used only by those authorized must attempt to detect and exclude the unauthorized. Access to it is therefore usually controlled by insisting on an authentication procedure to establish with some degree of confidence the identity of the user, granting privileges established for that identity.

The '''Battle of Salamis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|ə|m|ɪ|s}} {{respell|SAL|ə|miss}}; {{lang-grc|Ναυμαχία τῆς Σαλαμῖνος|Naumachía tês Salamînos}}) was a [[naval battle]] fought between an alliance of [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[Poleis|city-state]]s under [[Themistocles]], and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] under [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]] in 480 BC. It resulted in a decisive victory for the outnumbered Greeks. The battle was fought in the [[strait]]s between the mainland and [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], an island in the [[Saronic Gulf]] near [[Athens]], and marked the high point of the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]].

To block the Persian advance, a small force of Greeks blocked the pass of [[Thermopylae]], while an Athenian-dominated Allied navy engaged the Persian fleet in the nearby straits of [[Artemisium]]. In the resulting [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the rearguard of the Greek force was annihilated, whilst in the [[Battle of Artemisium]] the Greeks had heavy losses and retreated after the loss at Thermopylae. This allowed the Persians to conquer [[Phocis]], [[Boeotia]], [[Attica]], and [[Euboea]]. The Allies prepared to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] while the fleet was withdrawn to nearby Salamis Island.

Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general [[Themistocles]] to bring the Persian fleet to battle again, in the hope that a victory would prevent naval operations against the [[Peloponnese]]. The Persian king [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.

Xerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army, leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, the remainder of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the [[Battle of Plataea]] and the Persian navy at the [[Battle of Mycale]]. The Persians made no further attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea thus mark a turning point in the course of the Greco-Persian wars as a whole; from then onward, the Greek ''[[poleis]]'' would take the offensive.

The Greek city-states of Athens and [[Eretria]] had supported the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499-494 BC, led by the satrap of Miletus, Aristagoras. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, pp.47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h203&quot; /&gt; Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h171/&gt; Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, pp.171–178&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the conquest of [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a client kingdom of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23946;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of '[[earth and water]]' in token of their submission to him.&lt;ref name = h178&gt;Holland, pp.178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of the Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt; This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;

Darius thus put together an amphibious task force under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490 BC, which attacked [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], before receiving the submission of the other [[Cyclades|Cycladic Islands]]. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231007;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]], the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.113 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp.206–206&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp.208–211&lt;/ref&gt; Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription.&lt;ref name = h208/&gt; Xerxes decided that the [[Hellespont]] would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of [[Mount Athos]] (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).&lt;ref name = h213/&gt; These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state.&lt;ref name = h213&gt;Holland, pp.213–214&lt;/ref&gt; By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at [[Sardis]] marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two [[pontoon bridge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231100;layout=;loc=7.35.1 VII, 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician [[Themistocles]], to build a massive fleet of [[trireme]]s that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = h217&gt;Holland, pp.217–223&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but made the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.32.1 VII, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,&lt;ref name=VII145&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.145.1 VII, 145]&lt;/ref&gt; and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.&lt;ref name = h226&gt;Holland, p.226&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the 'congress' agreed to defend the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance.&lt;ref name = h248&gt;Holland, pp.248–249&lt;/ref&gt; However, once there, they were warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed through the pass by the modern village of [[Sarantaporo]], and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming, so the Greeks retreated.&lt;ref name=VII173&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.173.1 VII, 173]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. A second strategy was therefore adopted by the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnese) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]]. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.&lt;ref name = h255&gt;Holland, pp.255–257&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] should it come to it, whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated ''en masse'' to the Peloponnesian city of [[Troezen]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231343;layout=;loc=8.39.1 VIII, 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

Famously, the much smaller Greek army [[Battle of Thermopylae|held]] the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians for three days before being outflanked by a mountain path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed.&lt;ref name = h292&gt;Holland, pp.292–294&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was up to that point a stalemate;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231321;layout=;loc=8.19.1 VIII, 18]&lt;/ref&gt; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231324;layout=;loc=8.20.1 VIII, 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied fleet now rowed from Artemisium to Salamis to assist with the final evacuation of Athens. ''En route'' Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the [[Ionia]]n Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dandamaev|first=E.

Brill|isbn=90-04-09172-6|page=204|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{quote|Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the [[Caria]]ns to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you.''&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231325;loc=8.23.1 VIII, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;}} --&gt; Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack the [[Boeotia]]n cities that had not surrendered, [[Plataea]] and [[Thespiae]], before marching on the now evacuated city of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231353;layout=;loc=8.49.1 VIII, 50]&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies (mostly Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231380;layout=;loc=8.72.1 VIII, 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy was flawed, however, unless the Allied fleet was able to prevent the Persian fleet from transporting troops across the Saronic Gulf. In a council-of-war called once the evacuation of Athens was complete, the Corinthian naval commander [[Adeimantus of Corinth|Adeimantus]] argued that the fleet should assemble off the coast of the Isthmus in order to achieve such a blockade.&lt;ref name = h302&gt;Holland, pp.302–303&lt;/ref&gt; However, Themistocles argued in favour of an offensive strategy, aimed at decisively destroying the Persians' naval superiority. He drew on the lessons of Artemisium, pointing out that ''&quot;battle in close conditions works to our advantage&quot;''.&lt;ref name = h302/&gt; He eventually won through, and the Allied navy remained off the coast of Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231369;layout=;loc=8.62.1 VIII, 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

The time-line for Salamis is difficult to establish with any certainty.&lt;ref name = L164/&gt; Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then this may be the case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying.&lt;ref name = L164&gt;Lazenby, pp.164–167&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at [[Phalerum]].&lt;ref name = VIII68/&gt; [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], queen of [[Halicarnassus]] and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk.&lt;ref name = VIII68&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231374;layout=;loc=8.68A%201 VIII, 68]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] pressed for an attack.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231378;layout=;loc=8.68C%201 VIII, 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to explain exactly what eventually brought about the battle, assuming that neither side simply attacked without forethought.&lt;ref name = L164/&gt; Clearly though, at some point just before the battle, new information began to reach Xerxes of rifts in the allied command; the Peloponnesians wished to evacuate from Salamis while they still could.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231383;layout=;loc=8.75.1 VIII, 74]&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged rift amongst the Allies may have simply been a ruse, in order to lure the Persians to battle.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt;  Alternatively, this change in attitude amongst the Allies (who had waited patiently off the coast of Salamis for at least a week while Athens was captured) may have been in response to Persian offensive maneuvers.&lt;ref name = L164/&gt; Possibly, a Persian army had been sent to march against the Isthmus in order to test the nerve of the fleet.&lt;ref name = L164/&gt;&lt;ref name = h310/&gt;

Either way, when Xerxes received this news, he ordered his fleet to go out on patrol off the coast of Salamis, blocking the southern exit.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; Then, at dusk, he ordered them to withdraw, possibly in order to tempt the Allies into a hasty evacuation.&lt;ref name = h310&gt;Holland, pp.310–315&lt;/ref&gt; That evening Themistocles attempted what appears to have been a spectacularly successful use of disinformation. He sent a servant, [[Sicinnus]], to Xerxes, with a message proclaiming that Themistocles was ''&quot;on the king's side and prefers that your affairs prevail, not the Hellenes&quot;''.&lt;ref name = VIII75&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231384;layout=;loc=8.76.1 VIII, 75]&lt;/ref&gt;  Themistocles claimed that the Allied command was in-fighting, that the Peloponnesians were planning to evacuate that very night, and that to gain victory all the Persians needed to do was to block the straits.&lt;ref name = VIII75/&gt; In performing this subterfuge, Themistocles seems to have been trying to bring about exactly the opposite; to lure the Persian fleet into the Straits.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; This was exactly the kind of news that Xerxes wanted to hear; that the Athenians might be willing to submit to him, and that he would be able to destroy the rest of the Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; Xerxes evidently took the bait, and the Persian fleet was sent out that evening to effect this block.&lt;ref name = VIII76&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.76 VIII, 76]&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes ordered a throne to be set up on the slopes of [[Mount Aigaleo]] (overlooking the straits), in order to watch the battle from a clear vantage point, and so as to record the names of commanders who performed particularly well.&lt;ref name = h318/&gt;

According to Herodotus, the Allies spent the evening heatedly debating their course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231389;layout=;loc=8.79.1 VIII, 78]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peloponnesians were in favour of evacuating,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.70 VIII, 70]&lt;/ref&gt; and at this point Themistocles attempted his ruse with Xerxes.&lt;ref name = VIII75/&gt; It was only when [[Aristides]], the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231388;layout=;loc=8.80.1 VIII, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231391;layout=;loc=8.83.1 VIII, 82]&lt;/ref&gt; that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so would fight.&lt;ref name = VIII83/&gt;

However, the Peloponnesians may have been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p.316&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied navy was thus able to prepare properly for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; it is not clear when, why or how this decision was made, but it is clear that they did take the battle to the Allies.&lt;ref name = h318&gt;Holland, p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

==The opposing forces==
===The Greek fleet===
[[File:Trireme.jpg|thumb|Greek [[trireme]].]]
[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|Fleet of triremes based on the full-sized replica ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]'']]
Herodotus reports that there were 378 triremes in the Allied fleet, and then breaks the numbers down by city state (as indicated in the table).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.42.1 VIII, 44–48]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his numbers for the individual contingents only add up to 371. He does not explicitly say that all 378 fought at Salamis (''&quot;All of these came to the war providing triremes...The total number of ships...was three hundred and seventy-eight&quot;''),&lt;ref name = VIII48/&gt; and he also says that the Aeginetans ''&quot;had other manned ships, but they guarded their own land with these and fought at Salamis with the thirty most seaworthy&quot;''.&lt;ref name = VIII46/&gt; Thus it has been supposed that the difference between the numbers is accounted for by a [[garrison]] of 12 ships left at [[Aegina]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Macaulay, in a note accompanying his translation of Herodotus VIII, 85&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus, two more ships defected from the Persians to the Greeks, one before Artemisium and one before Salamis, so the total complement at Salamis would have been 373 (or 380).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231391;layout=;loc=8.81.1 VIII, 82]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Athenian playwright [[Aeschylus]], who actually fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being the number of Athenian ships).&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, The Persians&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ctesias]] claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers.&lt;ref name = ctes/&gt; According to [[Hypereides|Hyperides]], the Greek fleet numbered only 220.&lt;ref name = Lee&gt;Lee, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/27greek.html A Layered Look Reveals Ancient Greek Texts]&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet was effectively under the command of Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman [[Eurybiades]], as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC.&lt;ref name = h226-7&gt;Holland, pp.226–227&lt;/ref&gt; Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.&lt;ref name = h226-7/&gt;

The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by [[Ephorus]],&lt;ref&gt;Ephorus, Universal History&lt;/ref&gt; while his teacher [[Isocrates]] claims there were 1,300 at Doriskos and 1,200  at Salamis.&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, Oration VII, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, Oration IV, 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Ctesias gives another number, 1,000 ships,&lt;ref name = ctes&gt;Ctesias, [https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html Persica] (from Photius's Epitome)&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Plato]], speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'' III, 699&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 1,207 appears very early in the historical record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet;&lt;ref&gt;Köster (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p.394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L93&gt;Lazenby, pp.93–94&lt;/ref&gt; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the [[Iliad]], and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.&lt;ref name = L93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burn, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους 1971&quot;&gt;Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Demetrius, 1998&quot;&gt;Demetrius, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazenby p.174&quot;&gt;Lazenby p.174&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.&lt;ref name = VII185/&gt;

==Strategic and tactical considerations==
[[File:Ship dashed against ship, till the Persian Army dead strewed the deep like flowers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The battle of Salamis, 19th century illustration.]]
The overall Persian strategy for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season.&lt;ref name = h209&gt;Holland, pp.209–212&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Greeks sought to make the best use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse).&lt;ref name = h327&gt;Holland, pp.327–329&lt;/ref&gt; Time was now of the essence for the Persians – the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.&lt;ref name = h308&gt;Holland, pp.308–309&lt;/ref&gt; Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazenby, p.197&quot;&gt;Lazenby, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season.&lt;ref name = h308/&gt; Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.&lt;ref name = h303&gt;Holland, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was strategically not necessary for the Persians to actually fight this battle at Salamis.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; According to Herodotus, [[Artemisia I of Caria|Queen Artemisia]] of [[Caria]] pointed this out to Xerxes in the run-up to Salamis. Artemisia suggested that fighting at sea was an unnecessary risk, recommending instead:
{{quote|If you do not hurry to fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily accomplish what you had in mind on coming here. The Hellenes are not able to hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231376;layout=;loc=8.68A%201 VIII, 68]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Persian fleet was still large enough to both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, ''and'' send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; However, in the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.&lt;ref name = h303&gt;Holland, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the Allies, and also having &quot;better sailing&quot; ships.&lt;ref name = L138&gt;Lazenby, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;better sailing&quot; that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews;&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; most of the Athenian ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built as according to Themistocles' request to the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes in 483 BC, and had inexperienced crews. It is important to note that despite the inexperienced crew on part of the Athenians, these newly constructed triremes would ultimately prove crucial in the forthcoming conflict with Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp.222–224&lt;/ref&gt; The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming (triremes being equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one).&lt;ref name = L34&gt;Lazenby, pp.34–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as ''[[diekplous]]''. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved rowing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; This maneuver would have required skilled crews, and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it; the Allies however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt;

There has been much debate as to the nature of the Allied fleet compared to the Persian fleet.  Much of this centres on the suggestion, from Herodotus, that the Allied ships were heavier, and by implication less maneuverable.&lt;ref name = VIII60&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%231364;loc=8.60.1 VIII, 60]&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction, or that the ships were waterlogged since they had not been dried out in the winter (though there is no real evidence for either suggestion).&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armored [[hoplite]] marines (20 fully armored hoplites would have weighed 2 tons).&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; This 'heaviness', whatever its cause, would further reduce the likelihood of them employing the ''diekplous''.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; It is therefore probable that the Allies had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier).&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships at Artemisium, rather than sinking them.&lt;ref name=&quot;VIII11&quot; /&gt; It has been suggested that the weight of the Allied ships may also have made them more stable in the winds off the coast of Salamis, and made them less susceptible to ramming (or rather, less liable to sustain damage when rammed).&lt;ref name = Strauss/&gt;

The Persians preferred a battle in the open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers.&lt;ref name = h318/&gt; For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little.&lt;ref name = h302/&gt; The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless they had been confident of the collapse of the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have played a key role in tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks.&lt;ref name = h318/&gt; Salamis was, for the Persians, an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.&lt;ref name = L248&gt;Lazenby, pp.248–253&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battle==
[[File:Battle of salamis.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3]]

The actual battle of Salamis is not well described by the ancient sources, and it is unlikely that anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland, p399&quot;&gt;Holland, p.399&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is more of a discussion than a definitive account.

===Dispositions===
In the Allied fleet, the Athenians were on the left, and on the right were probably the Spartans (although Diodorus says it was the Megareans and Aeginetians); the other contingents were in the center.&lt;ref name = VIII85/&gt;&lt;ref name = DSXI18&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%2394;layout=;loc=11.17.1 XI, 18]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Allied fleet probably formed into two ranks, since the straits would have been too narrow for a single line of ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazenby, p187&quot;&gt;Lazenby, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus has the Allied fleet in a line running north–south, probably with the northern flank off the coast of modern-day Saint George's Islet (''Ayios Georgis''), and the southern flank off the coast of Cape Vavari (part of Salamis).&lt;ref name = L184&gt;Lazenby, pp.184–185&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus suggests the Allied fleet was aligned east–west, spanning the straits between Salamis and Mount Aigaleo; however, it is unlikely that the Allies would have rested one of their flanks against Persian occupied territory.&lt;ref name = L184/&gt;

It seems relatively certain that the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231385;layout=;loc=8.75.1 VIII, 76]&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version.&lt;ref name = h320/&gt;&lt;ref name = L181&gt;Lazenby, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night.&lt;ref name = h320/&gt;&lt;ref name = L181/&gt; Regardless of when they attempted it, it seems likely that the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east–west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north–south alignment (see diagram).&lt;ref name = L174&gt;Lazenby, pp.174–180&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus);&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.&lt;ref name = VIII85&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231394;layout=;loc=8.84.1 VIII 85]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diodorus says that the Egyptian fleet was sent to circumnavigate Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits.&lt;ref name = DSXI17&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%2393;layout=;loc=11.18.1 XI, 17]&lt;/ref&gt; If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially if he was not expecting the Allies to fight).&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it;&lt;ref name = L174/&gt; though again, others accept it as a possibility.&lt;ref name = h310/&gt; Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as [[Psyttaleia]], in the middle of the exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).&lt;ref name = h318/&gt;

===The opening phase===
[[File:Greek triremes at Salamis.jpg|thumb|Greek [[trireme]]s at Salamis.]]
Regardless of what time they entered the straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. Since they were not planning to flee after all, the Allies would have been able to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.&lt;ref name = VIII83&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231392;layout=;loc=8.84.1 VIII, 83]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Herodotus, this was dawn, and as the Allies ''&quot;were  putting out to sea the barbarians immediately attacked them&quot;''.&lt;ref name = VIII83/&gt;&lt;ref name = VIII84/&gt; If the Persians only entered the straits at dawn, then the Allies would have had the time to take up their station in a more orderly fashion.&lt;ref name = h320/&gt;

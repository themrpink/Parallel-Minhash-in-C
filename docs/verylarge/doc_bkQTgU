== True geese and their relatives ==
[[File:Anser caerulescens CT8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow geese]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]]]
[[File:Bütykös lúd - Gergelyiugornya.JPG|thumb|[[Chinese geese]], the domesticated form of the [[swan goose]]]]

The two living [[genus|genera]] of true geese are: ''[[Anser (genus)|Anser]]'', grey geese and white geese, such as the [[greylag goose]] and [[snow goose]] and ''[[Branta]]'', black geese, such as the [[Canada goose]].

Two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the [[shelduck]]s or form a subfamily on their own: ''[[Cereopsis]]'', the Cape Barren goose, and ''[[Cnemiornis]]'', the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like [[coscoroba swan]] is the closest living relative of the true geese.

[[Fossil]]s of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in [[North America]], is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 [[million years ago]] in the [[Miocene]]. The aptly named ''Anser atavus'' (meaning &quot;progenitor goose&quot;) from some 12 million years ago had even more [[plesiomorph]]ies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from [[subfossil]] remains found on the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

Geese are [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]], living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamprecht |first=Jürg |title=Female reproductive strategies in bar-headed geese (''Anser indicus''): Why are geese monogamous? |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=297–305 |publisher=Springer |year=1987 |doi=10.1007/BF00299967|s2cid=34973918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-05-10|title=Canada Goose {{!}} National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/c/canada-goose/|access-date=2020-11-21|website=Animals|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Geese ==
Geese fossils have been found ranging from 10 to 12 million years ago. Fossils found in the Gagarno region of central Italy suggest the existence of a pre-historic relative of the goose, that stood one and a half metres tall. The evidence suggests the bird was flightless unlike modern geese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fossils from ancient extinct giant flightless goose suggests it was a fighter|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-fossils-ancient-extinct-giant-flightless.html|access-date=2020-11-21|website=phys.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mainly [[Southern Hemisphere]] birds are called &quot;geese&quot;, most of which belong to the [[shelduck]] subfamily [[Tadorninae]]. These are:
* The [[Orinoco goose]] (''Neochen jubata'')
* The [[Egyptian goose]] (''Alopochen aegyptiaca'')
* The South American [[Sheldgoose|sheldgeese]] in the genus ''Chloephaga''
* The [[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds|prehistoric]] [[Malagasy sheldgoose]] (''Centrornis majori'')

Others:
* The [[spur-winged goose]] (''Plectropterus gambensis'') is most closely related to the shelducks, but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily, the [[Plectropterinae]].
* The [[blue-winged goose]] (''Cyanochen cyanopterus'') and the [[Cape Barren goose]] (''Cereopsis novaehollandiae'') have disputed affinities. They belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the [[Tadorninae]], the [[Anserinae]], or closer to the dabbling ducks (Anatinae).
* The three species of small waterfowl in the genus ''[[Nettapus]]'' named &quot;pygmy geese&quot;; they seem to represent another ancient lineage, with possible affinities to the Cape Barren goose or the spur-winged goose.
* The [[maned goose]], also known as the maned duck or Australian wood duck (''Chenonetta jubata'')
* A genus of prehistorically [[extinct]] [[seaduck]]s, ''[[Chendytes]]'', is sometimes called the &quot;diving-geese&quot; due to their large size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New Records and a New Species of Chendytes, an Extinct Genus of Diving Geese |first=Hildegarde |last=Howard |journal=The Condor |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=1955 |pages=135–143 |doi=10.2307/1364861 |jstor=1364861}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[magpie goose]] (''Anseranas semipalmata'') is the only living species in the family [[Anseranatidae]].
* The [[northern gannet]] (''Morus bassanus''), a seabird, is also known as the &quot;solan goose&quot;, although it is unrelated to the true geese, or any other [[Anseriformes]] for that matter.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== In popular culture ==
Well-known sayings about geese include:{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}
* To &quot;have a gander&quot; is to examine something in detail.
* {{anchor|sauce}} &quot;What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander&quot; or &quot;What's good for the goose is good for the gander&quot; means that what is an appropriate treatment for one person is equally appropriate for someone else.
* Saying that someone's &quot;goose is cooked&quot; means that they have suffered, or are about to suffer, a terrible setback or misfortune.
* The common phrase &quot;silly goose&quot; is used when referring to someone who is acting particularly silly.
* &quot;[[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs|Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs]]&quot;, derived from an old fable, is a saying referring to any greed-motivated, unprofitable action that destroys or otherwise renders useless a favourable situation.
* &quot;A wild goose chase&quot; is a useless, futile waste of time and effort.
* There is a legendary old woman called [[Mother Goose]] who wrote nursery rhymes for children.
* A raised, rounded area of swelling (typically a [[hematoma]]) caused by an impact injury is sometimes metaphorically called a &quot;goose egg&quot;, especially if it occurs on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Roland, James. &quot;What’s Causing This Bump on My Forehead, and Should I Be Concerned?&quot; HealthLine, 2 Aug 2018.

===&quot;Gray Goose Laws&quot; in Iceland===

The oldest collection of [[Icelandic Commonwealth| Medieval Icelandic]] laws is known as ''&quot;Grágás&quot;''; i.e., the ''[[Gray Goose Laws]]''. 

Various etymologies were offered for that name:  
* The fact that the laws were written with a goose quill;
* The fact that the laws were bound in goose skin; 
* Because of the age of the laws — it was then believed that geese lived longer than other birds.&lt;ref&gt;Boulhosa, Patricia Press. “The Law of Óláfr inn Helgi.” In ''Icelanders and the Kings of Norway: Mediaeval Sagas and Legal Texts''.

[[File:Winpdb-1.3.6.png|thumb |[[Winpdb]] debugging itself]]

A '''debugger''' or '''debugging tool''' is a [[computer program]] used to [[software testing|test]] and [[debugging|debug]] other programs (the &quot;target&quot; program). The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its operations in progress and monitor changes in computer resources (most often memory areas used by the target program or the computer's operating system) that may indicate malfunctioning code. Typical debugging facilities include the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points, display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty program execution.

The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an ''[[instruction set simulator]]'' (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor. Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.

A &quot;[[trap (computing)|trap]]&quot; occurs when the program cannot normally continue because of a [[software bug|programming bug]] or invalid data. For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the [[central processing unit|CPU]] or attempted to access unavailable or [[memory protection|protected]] [[computer memory|memory]]. When the program &quot;traps&quot; or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the location in the original code if it is a '''source-level debugger''' or '''symbolic debugger''', commonly now seen in [[integrated development environment]]s. If it is a '''low-level debugger''' or a '''machine-language debugger''' it shows the line in the [[disassembly]] (unless it also has online access to the original source code and can display the appropriate section of code from the assembly or compilation).

==Features==
Typically, debuggers offer a query processor, a symbol resolver, an expression interpreter, and a debug support interface at its top level.&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal and Kumar, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program [[stepping (debugging)|step by step]] ('''single-stepping''' or [[program animation]]), stopping ('''breaking''') (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some event or specified instruction by means of a [[breakpoint]], and tracking the values of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal and Kumar 2003, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Some debuggers have the ability to modify program state while it is running. It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error.

The same functionality which makes a debugger useful for correcting bugs allows it to be used as a [[software cracking]] tool to evade [[copy protection]], [[digital rights management]], and other software protection features. It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, [[fault coverage]], and [[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analyzer]], especially if [[instruction path length]]s are shown.&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal and Kumar, pp. 307-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Early microcomputers with disk-based storage often benefitted from the ability to diagnose and recover corrupted directory or registry data records, to &quot;undelete&quot; files marked as deleted, or to crack file password protection.

Most mainstream debugging engines, such as [[gdb]] and [[dbx (debugger)|dbx]], provide console-based [[command line interface]]s. [[Debugger front-end]]s are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide [[Integrated Developer Environment|IDE]] integration, [[program animation]], and visualization features.

=== Record and replay debugging ===
[[Record and replay debugging]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first1=Robert |last1=O'Callahan |first2=Chris |last2=Jones |first3=Nathan |last3=Froyd |first4=Kyle |last4=Huey |first5=Albert |last5=Noll |first6=Nimrod |last6=Partush |title=Engineering Record And Replay For Deployability Extended Technical Report |year=2017 |class=cs.PL |eprint=1705.05937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as &quot;software flight recording&quot; or &quot;program execution recording&quot;, captures application state changes and stores them to disk as each instruction in a program executes. The recording can then be replayed over and over, and interactively debugged to diagnose and resolve defects. Record and replay debugging is very useful for remote debugging and for resolving intermittent, non-deterministic, and other hard-to-reproduce defects.

==={{anchor|Reverse debugging}}Reverse debugging===
&lt;!-- At least six pages redirect to this section. Please do not remove the section or rename the anchor, without first getting consensus on the talk page. --&gt;
Some debuggers include a feature called &quot;'''reverse debugging'''&quot;, also known as &quot;historical debugging&quot; or &quot;backwards debugging&quot;. These debuggers make it possible to step a program's execution backwards in time. Various debuggers include this feature. [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] (2010 Ultimate edition, 2012 Ultimate, 2013 Ultimate, and 2015 Enterprise edition) offers IntelliTrace reverse debugging for C#, Visual Basic .NET, and some other languages, but not C++. Reverse debuggers also exist for C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, and other languages. Some are open source; some are proprietary commercial software. Some reverse debuggers slow down the target by orders of magnitude, but the best reverse debuggers cause a slowdown of 2× or less. Reverse debugging is very useful for certain types of problems, but is still not commonly used yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Philip Claßen|author2=Undo Software|title=Why is reverse debugging rarely used?|url=http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/181527/why-is-reverse-debugging-rarely-used|work=Programmers Stack Exchange|publisher=Stack Exchange, Inc|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language dependency==
Some debuggers operate on a single specific language while others can handle multiple languages transparently. For example, if the main target program is written in [[COBOL]] but calls [[assembly language]] subroutines and [[PL/1]] subroutines, the debugger may have to dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur.

==Memory protection==
Some debuggers also incorporate memory protection to avoid [[storage violation]]s such as [[buffer overflow]]. This may be extremely important in [[transaction processing]] environments where memory is dynamically allocated from memory 'pools' on a task by task basis.

==Hardware support for debugging==
Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their [[CPU design]] to make debugging easier:
*Hardware support for single-stepping a program, such as the [[trap flag]].
*An instruction set that meets the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]] makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged; such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under debugger control.
*[[In-system programming]] allows an external hardware debugger to reprogram a system under test (for example, adding or removing instruction breakpoints). Many systems with such ISP support also have other hardware debug support.
*Hardware support for code and data [[breakpoint]]s, such as address comparators and data value comparators or, with considerably more work involved, [[page fault]] hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal and Kumar 2003, pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joint Test Action Group#Example: ARM11 debug TAP|JTAG]] access to hardware debug interfaces such as those on [[ARM architecture]] processors or using the [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] command set. Processors used in embedded systems typically have extensive JTAG debug support.
*Micro controllers with as few as six pins need to use low pin-count substitutes for JTAG, such as [[Background debug mode interface|BDM]], [[Spy-Bi-Wire]], or [[debugWIRE]] on the [[Atmel AVR]]. DebugWIRE, for example, uses bidirectional signaling on the RESET pin.

==Debugger front-ends==
Some of the most capable and popular debuggers implement only a simple command line interface (CLI)—often to maximize [[porting|portability]] and minimize resource consumption. Developers typically consider debugging via a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) easier and more productive.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} This is the reason for visual front-ends, that allow users to monitor and control subservient CLI-only debuggers via [[graphical user interface]]. Some GUI debugger front-ends are designed to be compatible with a variety of CLI-only debuggers, while others are targeted at one specific debugger.

'''''French Kiss''''' is a 1995 [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Kevin Kline]]. Written by [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]], the film is about a woman who flies to France to confront her straying fiancé and gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her uses her to smuggle a stolen diamond necklace. ''French Kiss'' was filmed on location in Paris, the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] région of southeastern France, and [[Cannes]]. The film was released in the United States on May 5, 1995, and received mixed reviews. The film went on to earn a total worldwide gross of $101,982,854.

A [[Hindi]] remake of the film named ''[[Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha]]'' was released on July 24, 1998. The 2004 [[Malayalam]] comedy film ''[[Vettam]]'' was also based on ''French Kiss''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/oct102004/mr5.asp “Vettam”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022193341/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/oct102004/mr5.asp |date=2017-10-22 }}.

==Plot==
The fastidious and wholesome history teacher named Kate (Ryan) is living in Canada with her fiancé, Charlie ([[Timothy Hutton]]), a doctor. While waiting for her Canadian citizenship to come through, Kate has been busy planning their wedding and the purchase of their first house, complete with a white picket fence. When Charlie urges her to accompany him to Paris for an upcoming conference, she declines due to her fear of flying and her general intolerance for cheese, secondhand smoke, and the French.

A few days later, Kate's plans for the future are crushed when she receives a phone call from Charlie, who informs her that he has fallen in love with a beautiful French &quot;goddess&quot; named Juliette ([[Susan Anbeh]]) and that he will not be returning. Determined to win him back, Kate boards a flight to Paris and is seated next to a crude Frenchman, Luc Teyssier (Kline), whose every word seems to annoy her. Unknown to Kate, Luc is smuggling a vine cutting and a stolen diamond necklace into France, hoping to use both to start his own vineyard. With the help of a few drinks, Kate is able to tolerate her &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;hygiene-deficient&quot; seating partner long enough to arrive safely in Paris. Before deboarding, Luc sneaks the vine and necklace into Kate's bag, knowing she will not be searched at customs.

At the terminal, Luc is spotted by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon ([[Jean Reno]]), who insists on giving him a ride during which he searches his bag. Jean-Paul knows of Luc's vocation, but feels &quot;protective&quot; of him because Luc once saved his life. Meanwhile, Kate arrives at the [[Four Seasons Hotel George V|Hôtel George V]], where she encounters new levels of French sarcasm and rudeness from the [[concierge]] ({{ill|Laurent Spielvogel|fr}}). While waiting in the lobby with a petty thief named Bob ([[François Cluzet]]), Kate sees Charlie and Juliette kissing in a descending elevator and faints. Bob steals her bag and leaves just as Luc arrives. After reviving Kate, Luc realizes that Bob now has the necklace, goes with Kate to Bob's apartment, and recovers the bag, absent her money and passport.

Upset with Luc, Kate heads off on her own, and learns that Charlie is traveling south to Cannes to meet Juliette's parents. Luc, meanwhile, realizes that the necklace must still be in Kate's bag. He tracks her down to the train station, offers to help her &quot;win back Charlie&quot;, and together they board a train to Cannes. After lactose-intolerant Kate samples some of the 452 [[List of French cheeses|official government cheeses of France]], she becomes sick, and they get off the train at Luc's hometown of La Ravelle in [[Paulhaguet]], where they stay at his family home and vineyard. Kate learns about Luc's past and how he gambled away his vineyard birthright to his brother in a single hand of poker; she also learns that while he may be a schemer, he knows a lot about wine, and dreams of someday buying land for his own winery. As they board the train to Cannes, Kate shows him that she, in fact, has the necklace.

At Cannes, the two check into a room at the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton Hotel]] using a stolen credit card. Following Luc's advice, Kate confronts Charlie in front of Juliette on the beach, pretending to be indifferent to him. To make him jealous, Luc pretends to be Kate's lover, and the deception works. Later that afternoon, Jean-Paul approaches Kate and urges her to convince Luc to return the necklace anonymously to avoid jail. Luc was planning to sell the necklace at [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]], but agrees to Kate's &quot;new plan&quot; to have her sell the necklace, as that would be safer. At dinner, Charlie apologizes to Kate and accompanies her to her room, where he tries to seduce her. Rejecting his advances, Kate realizes she no longer wants him, and that she has fallen in love with Luc. Meanwhile, in an effort to &quot;ensure victory&quot; for her, Luc takes an all-too-willing Juliette to bed, but his plan fails when he calls her &quot;Kate&quot;.

The following morning, Kate tells Luc that Charlie wants her back, but quickly leaves the room, saying, &quot;Cartier is waiting&quot;. She returns the necklace to Jean-Paul and purchases a Cartier check for $45,782 with her own savings to create the illusion that she sold it. After giving the check to Luc, she leaves for the airport pretending to meet Charlie. Soon after, Jean-Paul approaches Luc and reveals the charade and all that Kate has done for him. Luc rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and confesses that he is in love with her and wants her to stay with him. Sometime later, Kate and he embrace in their beautiful new vineyard.

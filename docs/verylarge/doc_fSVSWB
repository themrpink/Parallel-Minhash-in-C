== History ==
{{Main|History of the United States Forest Service}}

The concept of national forests was born from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation group, [[Boone and Crockett Club]], due to concerns regarding [[Yellowstone National Park]] beginning as early as 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=William G.|title=History of the Boone and Crockett Club Pg 64-80|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1000&amp;context=sheldon&amp;type=additional|website=Scholar Works, University of Montana|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=1 February 2017|ref=Pg. 65-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Congress formed the office of Special Agent in the Department of Agriculture to assess the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. [[Franklin B. Hough]] was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed '''Division of Forestry'''. The [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as forest reserves managed by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the '''Bureau of Forestry'''.

The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the [[General Land Office]] of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry, henceforth known as the '''United States Forest Service'''. [[Gifford Pinchot]] was the first [[United States Chief Foresters|United States Chief Forester]] in the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt]].

A historical note to include is that the [[National Park Service]] was created in 1916 to manage Yellowstone and several other parks; in 1956, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] became the manager of lands reserved for wildlife. The [[United States Grazing Service|Grazing Service]] and the [[General Land Office]] were combined to create the [[Bureau of Land Management]] in 1946. Also of note was that it was not until 1976 that the Federal Land Policy and Management Act became the national policy for retaining public land for federal ownership.

Significant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the [[Weeks Act]] of 1911, the [[Multiple Use – Sustained Yield Act of 1960]], P.L. 86-517; the [[Wilderness Act]], P.L. 88-577; the [[National Forest Management Act]], P.L. 94-588; the [[National Environmental Policy Act]], P.L. 91-190; the [[Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act]], P.L. 95-313; and the [[Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act]], P.L. 95-307.

In February 2009, the [[Government Accountability Office]] evaluated whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the [[National Park Service]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], and the [[Bureau of Land Management]], managing some {{convert|438|e6acre|km2}} of public land.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao.gov&quot;/&gt; The Government Accountability Office did not offer a recommendation. The Forest Service remains under the USDA.

== Organization ==

=== Overview ===
As of 2019, FY 2020 Forest Service total budget authority is $5.14 billion, a decrease of $815 million from 2019. The budget includes $2.4 billion for Wildland Fire Management, a decrease of $530 million from the 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution because the “fire fix” cap adjustment becomes available in FY 2020, while the FY 2019 Annualized Continuing Resolution includes $500 million above the base as bridge to the first year of the fire fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/media_wysiwyg/usfs-fy-2020-budget-justification.pdf|title=Forest Service FYI 2020 Budget Justification|last=|first=|date=|website=USDA Forest Service|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forest Service, headquartered in Washington, D.C., has 27,062 permanent, full-time employees as of Sept. 20, 2018, including 541 in the headquarters office and 26,521 in regional and field office.

The USDA Forest Service’s mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/documents/USFS_An_Overview_0106MJS.pdf|title=The U.S. Forest Service - An Overview|publisher=U.S. Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its motto is &quot;Caring for the land and serving people.&quot;

As the lead federal agency in natural resource conservation, the Forest Service provides leadership in the protection, management, and use of the nation's forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems. The agency's ecosystem approach to management integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment to meet current and future needs. Through implementation of land and resource management plans, the agency ensures sustainable ecosystems by restoring and maintaining species diversity and ecological productivity that helps provide recreation, water, timber, minerals, fish, wildlife, wilderness, and aesthetic values for current and future generations of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20heinrich.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clear-Cutting the Truth About Trees | first=Bernd | last=Heinrich | date=December 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday work of the Forest Service balances resource extraction, resource protection, and providing recreation. The work includes managing {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}} of national forest and grasslands, including {{convert|59|e6acre|km2}} of [[inventoried roadless area|roadless areas]]; 14,077 recreation sites; {{convert|143346|mi|km}} of trails; {{convert|374883|mi|km}} of roads; and the harvesting of 1.5 billion trees per year.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Further, the Forest Service fought fires on {{convert|2.996|e6acre|km2}} of land in 2007.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

The Forest Service organization includes ranger districts, national forests, regions, research stations and research work units and the Northeastern Area Office for State and Private Forestry. Each level has responsibility for a variety of functions.

=== National Places ===
The Chief of the Forest Service is a career federal employee who oversees the agency. The Chief reports to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an appointee of the President confirmed by the Senate. The Chief's staff provides broad policy and direction for the agency, works with the Administration to develop a budget to submit to Congress, provides information to Congress on accomplishments, and monitors activities of the agency. There are five deputy chiefs for the following areas: National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Research and Development, Business Operations, and Finance.

=== Research stations and research work units ===
[[File:U.S. Forest Products Lab.jpg|thumb|left|The Forest Products Laboratory, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].]]
The [[Forest Service Research and Development]] deputy area includes five research stations, the [[Forest Products Laboratory]], and the [[International Institute of Tropical Forestry]], in Puerto Rico. Station directors, like regional foresters, report to the Chief. Research stations include Northern, Pacific Northwest, Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southern. There are 92 research work units located at 67 sites throughout the United States. there are 80 Experimental Forests and Ranges that have been established progressively since 1908; many sites are more than 50 years old. The system provides places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types of the {{convert|195|e6acre|km2}} of public land administered by the Forest Service. Individual sites range from 47 to 22,500&amp;nbsp;ha in size.

Operations of Experimental Forests and Ranges are directed by local research teams for the individual sites, by Research Stations for the regions in which they are located, and at the level of the Forest Service.

Major themes in research at the Experimental Forests and Ranges includes:
develop of systems for managing and restoring forests, range lands, and watersheds; investigate the workings of forest and stream ecosystems; characterize plant and animal communities; observe and interpret long-term environmental change and many other themes.

=== Regions ===
[[File:United States Forest Service Regions 1-10.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the nine regions]]
There are nine regions in the Forest Service; numbered 1 through 10 (Region 7 was eliminated
in 1965 when the current Eastern Region was created from the former Eastern and
North Central regions.&lt;ref&gt;The Land We Cared for... A History of the Forest Service's Eastern Region.

=== National Forest or Grassland ===
{{further|List of U.S. National Forests|United States National Grassland}}
The Forest Service oversees 155 national forests, 20 grasslands, and one tall-grass prairie. Each administrative unit typically comprises several ranger districts, under the overall direction of a forest supervisor. Within the supervisor's office, the staff coordinates activities among districts, allocates the budget, and provides technical support to each district. Forest supervisors are line officers and report to regional foresters.

=== Ranger District ===
The Forest Service has over 600 ranger districts. Each district has a staff of 10 to 100 people under the direction of a district ranger, a line officer who reports to a forest supervisor. The districts vary in size from {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}}. Most on-the-ground activities occur on ranger districts, including trail construction and maintenance, operation of campgrounds, oversight of a wide variety of special use permitted activities, and management of vegetation and wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;{{USFS|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/organization|article=Agency Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major divisions ==

=== Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations ===
[[File:USA - Department of Agriculture Forest Service Patch.png|thumb|upright|Patch of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]
[[File:United States Forest Service Horse patrol.jpg|thumb|A horse patrol of the Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations unit]]

'''U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement &amp; Investigations''' (LEI), headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a [[List of law enforcement agencies|federal law enforcement agency]] of the U.S. government. It is responsible for enforcement of federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. All Law Enforcement Officers and Special Agents Receive their training through [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC).

Operations are divided into two major functional areas:
* Law enforcement: uniformed, high-visibility enforcement of laws
* Investigations: [[special agent]]s who investigate crimes against property, visitors, and employees

Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) enforce federal laws and regulations governing national forest lands and resources. LEOs also enforce some or all state laws on National Forest Lands. As part of that mission, LEOs carry firearms, defensive equipment, make arrests, execute [[search warrant]]s, complete reports, and testify in court. They establish a regular and recurring presence on a vast amount of public lands, roads, and recreation sites. The primary focus of their jobs is the protection of natural resources, protection of Forest Service employees and the protection of visitors. To cover the vast and varied terrain under their jurisdiction, they use [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, special service [[SUV]]s, horses, [[Police dog|K-9 units]], helicopters, [[snowmobile]]s, dirt bikes, and boats.

[[Special Agents]] are criminal investigators who plan and conduct investigations concerning possible violations of criminal and administrative provisions of the Forest Service and other statutes under the [[United States Code]]. Special agents are normally plainclothes officers who carry concealed firearms, and other defensive equipment, make arrests, carry out complex criminal investigations, present cases for prosecution to [[U.S. Attorneys]], and prepare investigative reports. All field agents are required to travel a great deal and usually maintain a case load of ten to fifteen ongoing criminal investigations at one time. Criminal investigators occasionally conduct internal and civil claim investigations.

=== National Forest System ===

The {{convert|193|e6acre|km2}} of public land that are managed as national forests and [[grassland]]s are collectively known as the National Forest System. These lands are located in 44 states, Puerto Rico, and the [[Virgin Islands]] and comprise about 9% of the total land area in the United States. The lands are organized into 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands. The mission of the National Forest System is to protect and manage the forest lands so they best demonstrate the sustainable multiple-use management concept, using an ecological approach, to meet the diverse needs of people.

=== State and Private Forestry ===
The goal of the State and Private Forestry program is to assist with financial and technical assistance to private landowners, state agencies, tribes, and community resource managers. It provides assistance by helping sustain the United States' urban and rural forests and their associated communities from wildland fires, insects, disease, and [[Invasive species|invasive]] organisms.&lt;ref name=deCalesta&gt;{{cite book | last = deCalesta| first = David S. | last2 = Eckley | first2 = Michael C. | title = Deer Management for Forest Landowners and Managers | publisher = CRC Press | date = 2019 | pages = 153 | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 537 staff are employed in the program and is administered through National Forest System regions and the Northeastern Area of the United States.&lt;ref name=deCalesta/&gt;

=== Research and development ===
[[File:USFS PNW lab.jpg|thumb|right|The U.S. Forest Service [[R&amp;D]] lab in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington]]
The [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service works to improve the health and use of the United States' forests and [[grassland]]s. Research has been part of the Forest Service mission since the agency's inception in 1905. Today, Forest Service researchers work in a range of biological, physical, and social science fields to promote sustainable management of United States' diverse forests and rangelands. Research employs about 550 scientists and several hundred technical and support staff, located at 67 sites throughout the United States and in [[Puerto Rico]]. Discovery and technology development and transfer is carried out through seven research stations.

Research focuses on informing policy and land management decisions and includes addressing [[Invasive species|invasive]] insects, degraded [[river ecosystem]]s, or sustainable ways to harvest forest products. The researchers work independently and with a range of partners, including other agencies, academia, nonprofit groups, and industry. The information and technology produced through basic and applied science programs is available to the public for its benefit and use.

In addition to the Research Stations, the USFS R&amp;D branch also leads several National Centers such as the [[National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation]].

=== International programs ===
The Forest Service plays a key role in formulating policy and coordinating U.S. support for the protection and sound management of the world's forest resources. It works closely with other agencies such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[U.S. Department of State|State Department]], and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], as well as with nonprofit development organizations, wildlife organizations, universities, and international assistance organizations. The Forest Service's international work serves to link people and communities striving to protect and manage forests throughout the world. The program also promotes [[sustainable land management]] overseas and brings important technologies and innovations back to the United States. The program focuses on conserving key natural resource in cooperation with countries across the world.

== Activities ==
[[File:US-national-forest-service-lands.png|thumb|350px|left|More than 80% of the 193 million acres (780,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land managed by the United States Forest Service is in the western states. This map shows USFS lands as a percentage of total land area in each state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm|title=Western States Data Public Land Acreage|work=wildlandfire.com|access-date=2010-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120656/http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although a large volume of [[Lumber|timber]] is [[Logging|logged]] every year, not all [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] are entirely forested. There are tidewater glaciers in the [[Tongass National Forest]] in [[Alaska]] and ski areas such as [[Alta, Utah]] in the [[Wasatch-Cache National Forest]]. In addition, the Forest Service is responsible for managing [[National Grassland]]s in the midwest. Furthermore, areas designated as wilderness by acts of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], prohibit logging, mining, road and building construction and land leases for purposes of farming and or livestock grazing.

Since 1978, several [[President of the United States|Presidents]] have directed the USFS to administer [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]] inside of preexisting National Forests.

* [[Admiralty Island National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] – California
* [[Misty Fjords National Monument]] – Alaska
* [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] – Washington
* [[Newberry National Volcanic Monument]] – Oregon
* [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] – California (jointly with the [[Bureau of Land Management]])

The Forest Service also manages [[Grey Towers National Historic Site]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], the home and estate of its first Chief, [[Gifford Pinchot]].

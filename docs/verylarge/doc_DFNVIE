The Umayyad empire was mostly Arab; however, the Abbasids progressively became made up of more and more converted Muslims in which the Arabs were only one of many ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bobrick |first1=Benson |title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad |date=2012 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1416567622 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a late tradition of several [[Abbasid expeditions to East Africa]]. According to the ''[[Book of the Zanj]]'', in the year 755, during the early stages of the Abbasid Caliphate, the people of current day [[Somalia]] around [[Mogadishu]] showed great loyalty to the newly created administration. It is reported that Yahya ibn Umar al Anzi the messenger of the second caliph of the Abbasids [[Abu Ja'far al-Mansur]] that the Sultan of Mogadishu and his people swore allegiance to the Caliphate and paid taxes regularly. However, in the year 804 (189 AH), the people of [[Mogadishu]] and the Swahili coast to [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] rebelled against the Abbasid rule and the administration of [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Additionally, they refused to pay tax. [[Harun al-Rashid]] sent a successful punitive mission to the region to reassert Abbasid control and sovereignty. Despite this, the Sultanate of Mogadishu remained in constant rebellion. In 829 [[Al-Ma'mun|Al Ma'mun]] the 7th Caliph of the Abbasids sent an army of 50,000 men to crush the secessionist enclaves and add them back to the Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ali Jimale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpdAzRYruCwC&amp;q=caliphate+mogadishu&amp;pg=PA4|title=The Invention of Somalia|date=1995|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-99-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mukhtar|first=Mohamed Haji|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;q=700%20mogadishu%20marwan%20umayyad&amp;pg=PR26|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=2003-02-25|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6604-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 756, the Abbasid Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] sent over 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] in the [[An Shi Rebellion]] against [[An Lushan]]. The Abbasids, or &quot;Black Flags&quot; as they were commonly called, were known in Tang dynasty chronicles as the ''hēiyī Dàshí'', &quot;The Black-robed Tazi&quot; ({{lang|zh|黑衣大食}}) (&quot;Tazi&quot; being a borrowing from Persian ''[[wikt:تازی|Tāzī]]'', the word for &quot;Arab&quot;).{{refn|group=nb|Wade states &quot;Tazi in Persian sources referred to a people in that land, but was later extended to cover Arab lands. The Persian term was adopted by Tang China (Dàshí :大食) to refer to the Arabs until the 12th century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2012|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Marshall Broomhall writes, &quot;With the rise of the Abbasides we enter upon a somewhat different phase of Muslim history, and approach the period when an important body of Muslim troops entered and settled within the Chinese Empire. While the Abbasids inaugurated that era of literature and science associated with the Court at Bagdad, the hitherto predominant Arab element began to give way to the Turks, who soon became the bodyguard of the Caliphs, 'until in the end the Caliphs became the helpless tools of their rude protectors.'

Several embassies from the Abbaside Caliphs to the Chinese Court are recorded in the T'ang Annals, the most important of these being those of (A-bo-lo-ba) Abul Abbas, the founder of the new dynasty; that of (A-p'u-cKa-fo) Abu Giafar, the builder of Baghdad; and that of (A-lun) Harun al Raschid, who is known in modern days through the popular work Arabian Nights. The Abbasides or 'Black Flags,' as they were commonly called, are known in Chinese history as the Heh-i Ta-shih, 'The Black-robed Arabs.'

Five years after the rise of the Abbasides, at a time when Abu Giafar, the second Caliph, was busy plotting the assassination of his great and able rival Abu Muslim, who is regarded as &quot;the leading figure of the age&quot; and the de facto founder of the house of Abbas so far as military prowess is concerned, a terrible rebellion broke out in China. This was in 755, and the leader was a Turk or Tartar named An Lu-shan. This man, who had gained great favour with the Emperor Hsuan Tsung, and had been placed at the head of a vast army operating against the Turks and Tartars on the north-west frontier, ended in proclaiming his independence and declaring war upon his now aged Imperial patron. The Emperor, driven from his capital, abdicated in favour of his son, Su Tsung (756–763), who at once appealed to the Arabs for help.

The Caliph Abu Giafar, whose army, we are told by Sir William Muir, was fitted throughout with improved weapons and armour,' responded to this request, and sent a contingent of some 4000 men, who enabled the Emperor, in 757, to recover his two capitals, Sianfu and Honanfu. These Arab troops, who probably came from some garrison on the frontiers of Turkestan, never returned to their former camp, but remained in China, where they married Chinese wives, and thus became, according to common report, the real nucleus of the naturalised Chinese Mohammedans of to-day.

While this story has the support of the official history of the T'ang dynasty, there is, unfortunately, no authorised statement as to how many troops the Caliph really sent. The statement, however, is also supported by the Chinese Mohammedan inscriptions and literature. Though the settlement of this large body of Arabs in China may be accepted as probably the largest and most definite event recorded concerning the advent of Islam, it is necessary at the same time not to overlook the facts already stated in the previous chapter, which prove that large numbers of foreigners had entered China prior to this date.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Frank Brinkley says, &quot;It would seem, however, that trade occupied the attention of the early Mohammedan settlers rather than religious propagandism; that while they observed the tenets and practised the rites of their faith in China, they did not undertake any strenuous campaign against either Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West by the oversea or the overland routes. According to Giles, the true stock of the present Chinese Mohammedans was a small army of four thousand Arabian soldiers, who, being sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion, were subsequently permitted to settle in China, where they married native wives.

The numbers of this colony received large accessions in the 12th and 13th centuries during the conquests of Genghis, and ultimately the Mohammedans formed an appreciable element of the population, having their own mosques and schools, and observing the rites of their religion, but winning few converts except among the aboriginal tribes, as the Lolos and the Mantsu. Their failure as propagandists is doubtless due to two causes, first, that, according to the inflexible rule of their creed, the Koran might not be translated into Chinese or any other foreign language; secondly and chiefly, that their denunciations of idolatry were as unpalatable to ancestor-worshipping Chinese as were their interdicts against pork and wine. They were never prevented, however, from practising their faith so long as they obeyed the laws of the land, and the numerous mosques that exist throughout China prove what a large measure of liberty these professors of a strange creed enjoyed. One feature of the mosques is noticeable, however: though distinguished by large arches and by Arabic inscriptions, they are generally constructed and arranged so as to bear some resemblance to Buddhist temples, and they have tablets carrying the customary ascription of reverence to the Emperor of China – facts suggesting that their builders were not entirely free from a sense of the inexpediency of differentiating the evidences of their religion too conspicuously from those of the popular creed. It has been calculated that in the regions north of the Yangtse the followers of Islam aggregate as many as ten millions, and that eighty thousand are to be found in one of the towns of Szchuan. On the other hand, just as it has been shown above that although the Central Government did not in any way interdict or obstruct the tradal operations of foreigners in early times, the local officials sometimes subjected them to extortion and maltreatment of a grievous and even unendurable nature, so it appears that while as a matter of State policy, full tolerance was extended to the Mohammedan creed, its disciples frequently found themselves the victims of such unjust discrimination at the hand of local officialdom that they were driven to seek redress in rebellion. That, however, did not occur until the 19th century. There is no evidence that, prior to the time of the Great Manchu Emperor Chienlung (1736–1796), Mohammedanism presented any deterrent aspect to the Chinese. That renowned ruler, whose conquests carried his banners to the Pamirs and the Himalayas, did indeed conceive a strong dread of the potentialities of Islamic fanaticism reinforced by disaffection on the part of the aboriginal tribes among whom the faith had many adherents. He is said to have entertained at one time the terrible project of eliminating this source of danger in Shensi and Kansuh by killing every Mussulman found there, but whether he really contemplated an act so foreign to the general character of his procedure is doubtful. The broad fact is that the Central Government of China has never persecuted Mohammedans or discriminated against them. They are allowed to present themselves at the examinations for civil or military appointments, and the successful candidates obtain office as readily as their Chinese competitors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brinkley|1902|pp=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|It states in Moule's book, &quot;though the actual date and circumstances of the introduction of Islam into China cannot be traced with certainty further back than the 13th century, yet the existence of settlements of foreign Moslems with their Mosques at Ganfu (Canton) during the T'ang dynasty (618–907) is certain, and later they spread to Ch'uan-chou and to Kan-p'u, Hangchow, and perhaps to Ningpo and Shanghai. These were not preaching or proselytising inroads, but commercial enterprises, and in the latter half of the 8th century there were Moslem troops in Shensi, 3,000 men, under Abu Giafar, coming to support the dethroned Emperor in 756. In the 13th century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan in 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Moslem affairs in China.

The present Muslim element in China is most numerous in Yunnan and Kansu; and the most learned Muslims reside chiefly in Ssuch'uan, the majority of their books being printed in the capital city, Ch'eng-tu. Kansu is perhaps the most dominantly Mohammedan province in China, and here many different sects are found, and mosques with minarets used by the orthodox muezzin calling to prayer, and in one place veiled women are met with. These, however, are not Turks or Saracens, but for the most part pure Chinese. The total Moslem population is probably under 4,000,000, though other statistical estimates, always uncertain in China, vary from thirty to ten millions; but the figures given here are the most reliable at present obtainable, and when it is remembered that Islam in China has not been to any great extent a preaching or propagandist power by force or the sword, it is difficult to understand the survival and existence of such a large number as that, small, indeed, compared with former estimates, but surely a very large and vigorous element.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moule|1914|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|In Giles' book, he writes &quot;Mahomedans: IEJ Iej. First settled in China in the Year of the Mission, A.D. 628, under Wahb-Abi-Kabcha a maternal uncle of Mahomet, who was sent with presents to the Emperor. Wahb-Abi-Kabcha travelled by sea to Canton, and thence overland to Si-ngan Fu, the capital, where he was well received. The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it still exists. Another mosque was erected in 742, but many of these M. came to China simply as traders, and by and by went back to their own country. The true stock of the present Chinese Mahomedans was a small army of 4,000 Arabian soldiers sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion. These soldiers had permission to settle in China, where they married native wives; and three centuries later, with the conquests of Genghis Khan, large numbers of Arabs penetrated into the Empire and swelled the Mahomedan community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giles|1886|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Al-Rashid sent embassies to the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] and established good relations with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis Bloodworth, Ching Ping Bloodworth 2004 214&quot;/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, &quot;In 789 the Khalifa Harun al Raschid dispatched a mission to China, and there had been one or two less important missions in the seventh and eighth centuries; but from 879, the date of the Canton massacre, for more than three centuries to follow, we hear nothing of the Mahometans and their religion. They were not mentioned in the edict of 845, which proved such a blow to Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity perhaps because they were less obtrusive in the propagation of their religion, a policy aided by the absence of anything like a commercial spirit in religious matters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giles|1915|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, in the same book, &quot;The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it may still be seen. The minaret, known as the Bare Pagoda, to distinguish it from a much more ornamental Buddhist pagoda near by, dates back to 850. There must at that time have been a considerable number of Mahometans in Canton, though not so many as might be supposed if reliance could be placed on the figures given in reference to a massacre which took place in 879. The fact is that most of these Mahometans went to China simply as traders; they did not intend to settle permanently in the country, and when business permitted, they returned to their old haunts. About two thousand Mussulman families are still to be found at Canton, and a similar number at Foochow; descendants, perhaps, of the old sea-borne contingents which began to arrive in the seventh and eighth centuries. These remnants have nothing to do with the stock from which came the comparatively large Mussulman communities now living and practising their religion in the provinces of Ssŭch'uan, Yünnan, and Kansuh.

===Abbasid Golden Age (775–861)===

The Abbasid leadership had to work hard in the last half of the 8th century (750–800) under several competent caliphs and their viziers to usher in the administrative changes needed to keep order of the political challenges created by the far-flung nature of the empire, and the limited communication across it.&lt;ref name = &quot;Brauer&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brauer|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this early period of the dynasty, in particular during the governance of [[al-Mansur]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], and [[al-Ma'mun]], that its reputation and power were created.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}

Al-Mahdi [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|restarted the fighting]] with the Byzantines, and his sons continued the conflict until [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] pushed for peace.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}} After several years of peace, [[Nikephoros I]] broke the treaty, then fended off multiple incursions during the first decade of the 9th century. These attacks pushed into the [[Taurus Mountains]], culminating with a victory at the [[Battle of Krasos]] and the [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|massive invasion of 806]], led by Rashid himself.&lt;ref name=DD1&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid's navy also proved successful, taking [[Cyprus]]. Rashid decided to focus on the rebellion of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]] in Khorasan and died while there.&lt;ref name=&quot;DD1&quot;/&gt; Military operations by the caliphate were minimal while the [[Byzantine Empire]] was fighting Abbasid rule in Syria and [[Anatolia]], with focus shifting primarily to internal matters; Abbasid governors exerted greater autonomy and, using this increasing power, began to make their positions hereditary.&lt;ref name = &quot;AHGC&quot;/&gt;

At the same time, the Abbasids faced challenges closer to home. Harun al-Rashid turned on and killed most of the [[Barmakids]], a Persian family that had grown significantly in administrative power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meisami|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, several factions began either to leave the empire for other lands or to take control of distant parts of the empire. Still, the reigns of al-Rashid and his sons were considered to be the apex of the Abbasids.&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbasid Dinar - Al Amin - 195 AH (811 AD).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Gold dinar]] minted during the reign of [[al-Amin]] (809–813)]]
After Rashid's death, the empire was split by a [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] between the caliph [[al-Amin]] and his brother [[al-Ma'mun]], who had the support of Khorasan. This war ended with a [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)|two-year siege]] of Baghdad and the eventual death of al-Amin in 813.&lt;ref name=DD1/&gt; Al-Ma'mun ruled for 20 years of relative calm interspersed with a rebellion in [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] by the [[Khurramites]], which was supported by the Byzantines. Al-Ma'mun was also responsible for the creation of an autonomous Khorasan, and the continued repulsing of Byzantine forays.&lt;ref name=DD1/&gt;

[[Al-Mu'tasim]] gained power in 833 and his rule marked the end of the strong caliphs. He strengthened his personal army with Turkish mercenaries and promptly restarted the war with the Byzantines. Though his attempt to seize [[Constantinople]] failed when his fleet was destroyed by a storm,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|pp=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; his military excursions were generally successful, culminating with a resounding victory in the [[Sack of Amorium]].

[[File:Old World 820.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Abbasid empire and other world empires in 9th century]]
===Fracture to autonomous dynasties (861–945)===

Even by 820, the [[Samanid]]s had begun the process of exercising independent authority in [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan]], and the succeeding [[Tahirid]] and [[Saffarid]] dynasties of Iran. The Saffarids, from Khorasan, nearly seized Baghdad in 876, and the [[Tulunid]]s took control of most of Syria. The trend of weakening of the central power and strengthening of the minor caliphates on the periphery continued.&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

An exception was the 10-year period of [[Al-Mu'tadid]]'s rule (892–902). He brought parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khorasan back into Abbasid control. Especially after the &quot;[[Anarchy at Samarra]]&quot; (861–870), the Abbasid central government was weakened and centrifugal tendencies became more prominent in the Caliphate's provinces. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various [[amir]]s, and the caliph [[al-Radi]] was forced to acknowledge their power by creating the position of &quot;Prince of Princes&quot; (''[[amir al-umara]]'').&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

[[Al-Mustakfi]] had a short reign from 944–946, and it was during this period that the Persian faction known as the [[Buyids]] from [[Daylam]] swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy in Baghdad. According to the history of [[Miskawayh]], they began distributing [[iqta]]s ([[fief]]s in the form of tax farms) to their supporters. This period of localized secular control was to last nearly 100 years.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} The loss of Abbasid power to the Buyids would shift as the Seljuks would take over from the Persians.&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

At the end of the eighth century, the Abbasids found they could no longer keep together a polity, which had grown larger than that of Rome, from Baghdad. In 793 the [[Zaydi]]-Shia dynasty of [[Idrisids]] set up a state from Fez in Morocco, while a family of governors under the Abbasids became increasingly independent until they founded the Aghlabid Emirate from the 830s. Al-Mu'tasim started the downward slide by utilizing non-Muslim mercenaries in his personal army. Also during this period, officers started assassinating superiors with whom they disagreed, in particular the caliphs.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}

By the 870s, Egypt became autonomous under [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]. In the East, governors decreased their ties to the center as well. The [[Saffarids]] of Herat and the [[Samanids]] of Bukhara began breaking away around this time, cultivating a much more [[Persianate culture]] and statecraft. Only the central lands of Mesopotamia were under direct Abbasid control, with Palestine and the Hijaz often managed by the Tulunids. Byzantium, for its part, had begun to push Arab Muslims farther east in Anatolia.

By the 920s, North Africa was lost to the [[Fatimid dynasty]], a Shia sect tracing its roots to Muhammad's daughter Fatima. The Fatimid dynasty took control of Idrisid and Aghlabid domains,&lt;ref name=mag /&gt; advanced to Egypt in 969, and established their capital near Fustat in Cairo, which they built as a bastion of Shia learning and politics. By 1000 they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam and the Abbasids, who by this time had fragmented into several governorships that, while recognizing caliphal authority from Baghdad, remained mostly autonomous. The Caliph himself was under 'protection' of the Buyid Emirs who possessed all of Iraq and western Iran, and were quietly Shia in their sympathies.

[[File:Abbasid Caliphate 891-892.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the fragmented Abbasid empire, with areas still under direct control of the Abbasid central government (dark green) and under autonomous rulers (light green) adhering to nominal Abbasid suzerainty, {{circa|892}}]]

Outside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury, such as the [[Soomro]] [[Emir]]s that had gained control of [[Sindh]] and ruled the entire province from their capital of [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brauer&quot; /&gt; [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] took the title of sultan, as opposed to the [[Emir|&quot;amir&quot;]] that had been in more common usage, signifying the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]]'s independence from caliphal authority, despite Mahmud's ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer mentioned the caliph's name in the Friday [[khutba]], or struck it off their coinage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brauer&quot; /&gt;

The [[Isma'ili]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo contested the Abbasids for the titular authority of the Islamic [[ummah]]. They commanded some support in the Shia sections of Baghdad (such as [[Karkh]]), although Baghdad was the city most closely connected to the caliphate, even in the Buyid and Seljuq eras. The challenge of the Fatimids only ended with their downfall in the 12th century.

===Buyid and Seljuq control (945–1118)===
[[File:Buyids within the Middle East, ca. 970.png|400px|thumb|Southwest Asia – c. 970 A.D]]
Despite the power of the [[Buyids|Buyid]] amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buyid bureaucrat [[Hilal al-Sabi']], and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. As Buyid power waned with the rule of [[Baha' al-Daula]], the caliphate was able to regain some measure of strength. The caliph [[al-Qadir]], for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the ''[[Baghdad Manifesto]]''. The caliphs kept order in Baghdad itself, attempting to prevent the outbreak of [[fitna (word)|fitnas]] in the capital, often contending with the ''[[ayyarun]]''.

With the Buyid dynasty on the wane, a vacuum was created that was eventually filled by the dynasty of [[Oghuz Turks]] known as the [[Seljuqs]]. By 1055, the Seljuqs had wrested control from the Buyids and Abbasids, and took any remaining temporal power.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} When the amir and former slave [[Basasiri]] took up the Shia [[Fatimid]] banner in Baghdad in 1056–57, the caliph [[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|al-Qa'im]] was unable to defeat him without outside help. [[Toghril Beg]], the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.

Once again, the Abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the Abbasid caliph remained the titular head of the Islamic community. The succeeding sultans [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malikshah]], as well as their vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]], took up residence in Persia, but held power over the Abbasids in Baghdad. When the dynasty began to weaken in the 12th century, the Abbasids gained greater independence once again.

===Revival of military strength (1118–1258)===
[[File:Abbasids Baghdad Iraq 1244.JPG|thumb|upright|Coin of the Abbasids, Baghdad, 1244]]

While the Caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] was the first caliph to build an army capable of meeting a Seljuk army in battle, he was nonetheless defeated in 1135 and assassinated. The Caliph [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|al-Muqtafi]] was the first Abbasid Caliph to regain the full military independence of the Caliphate, with the help of his vizier [[Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra|Ibn Hubayra]]. After nearly 250 years of subjection to foreign dynasties, he successfully defended Baghdad against the Seljuqs in the [[siege of Baghdad (1157)]], thus securing Iraq for the Abbasids. The reign of [[al-Nasir]] (d. 1225) brought the caliphate back into power throughout Iraq, based in large part on the [[Sufi]] [[futuwwa]] organizations that the caliph headed.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]] built the [[Mustansiriya School]], in an attempt to eclipse the Seljuq-era [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Nizamiyya]] built by [[Nizam al Mulk]].

[[File:DiezAlbumsFallOfBaghdad a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Siege of Baghdad]] by the Mongols led by [[Hulagu Khan]] in 1258]]

In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] established a powerful dynasty among the [[Mongol]]s of [[central Asia]]. During the 13th century, this [[Mongol Empire]] conquered most of the Eurasian land mass, including both China in the east and much of the old Islamic caliphate (as well as [[Kievan Rus']]) in the west. [[Hulagu Khan]]'s [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad]] in 1258 is traditionally seen as the approximate end of the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Yue|2008|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongols feared that a supernatural disaster would strike if the blood of [[Al-Musta'sim]], a direct descendant of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]],&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{harvnb|Glassé|Smith|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last reigning Abbasid caliph in Baghdad, was spilled. The Shia of [[Persia]] stated that no such calamity had happened after the death of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in the [[Battle of Kerbala]]; nevertheless, as a precaution and in accordance with a Mongol taboo which forbade spilling royal blood, Hulagu had Al-Musta'sim wrapped in a carpet and trampled to death by horses on 20 February 1258. The Caliph's immediate family was also executed, with the lone exceptions of his youngest son who was sent to Mongolia, and a daughter who became a slave in the [[harem]] of Hulagu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frazier|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo (1261–1517)===
{{Main |Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)}}
In the 9th century, the Abbasids created an army loyal only to their caliphate, composed of non-Arab origin people, known as [[Mamluks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;István Vásáry 2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Vásáry|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Isichei 1997 192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Isichei|1997|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T.

The Mamluk army, though often viewed negatively, both helped and hurt the caliphate. Early on, it provided the government with a stable force to address domestic and foreign problems. However, creation of this foreign army and al-Mu'tasim's transfer of the capital from Baghdad to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] created a division between the caliphate and the peoples they claimed to rule. In addition, the power of the Mamluks steadily grew until [[al-Radi]] (934–941) was constrained to hand over most of the royal functions to [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The Mamluks eventually came to power in Egypt. In 1261, following the devastation of Baghdad by the Mongols, the Mamluk rulers of Egypt re-established the Abbasid caliphate in [[Cairo]]. The first Abbasid caliph of Cairo was [[Al-Mustansir II of Cairo|Al-Mustansir]]. The Abbasid caliphs in Egypt continued to maintain the presence of authority, but it was confined to religious matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Abbasid caliphate of Cairo lasted until the time of [[Al-Mutawakkil III]], who was taken away as a prisoner by [[Selim I]] to Constantinople where he had a ceremonial role. He died in 1543, following his return to Cairo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Abbasid historical period lasting to the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol conquest of Baghdad]] in 1258 CE is considered the Islamic Golden Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tahir Abbas&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Abbas|2011|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid [[Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gregorian|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]], such as &quot;the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr&quot;, stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the Muslim world became an intellectual center for science, philosophy, medicine and education as&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot; /&gt; the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad, where both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars sought to translate and gather all the world's knowledge into [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot; /&gt; Many classic works of antiquity that would otherwise have been lost were translated into Arabic and Persian and later in turn translated into Turkish, Hebrew and Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot; /&gt; During this period the Muslim world was a cauldron of cultures which collected, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], Chinese, [[History of India|Indian]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], North African, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] and [[Byzantine|Medieval Greek]] civilizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot; /&gt; According to Huff, &quot;[i]n virtually every field of endeavor—in astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, optics and so forth—the Caliphate's scientists were in the forefront of scientific advance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|2003|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reigns of [[Harun al-Rashid]] (786–809) and his successors fostered an age of great intellectual achievement. In large part, this was the result of the schismatic forces that had undermined the Umayyad regime, which relied on the assertion of the superiority of [[Arab culture]] as part of its claim to legitimacy, and the Abbasids' welcoming of support from non-Arab Muslims. It is well established that the Abbasid caliphs modeled their administration on that of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibb|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harun al-Rashid's son, [[Al-Ma'mun]] (whose mother was [[Persian people|Persian]]), is even quoted as saying:
{{quote |The Persians ruled for a thousand years and did not need us Arabs even for a day. We have been ruling them for one or two centuries and cannot do without them for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spuler|1960|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of medieval thinkers and scientists living under Islamic rule played a role in transmitting [[Islamic science]] to the Christian West. In addition, the period saw the recovery of much of the [[Alexandria]]n mathematical, geometric and astronomical knowledge, such as that of [[Euclid]] and Claudius [[Ptolemy]]. These recovered mathematical methods were later enhanced and developed by other Islamic scholars, notably by [[Persian people|Persian]] scientists [[Al-Biruni]] and [[Abu Nasr Mansur]].

[[Christians]] (particularly [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads]] and the Abbasids by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brague|2009|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestorians played a prominent role in the formation of Arab culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010a|p=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Academy of Gondishapur]] being prominent in the late [[Sassanid]], [[Umayyad]] and early Abbasid periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Söylemez|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, eight generations of the Nestorian [[Bukhtishu]] family served as private doctors to caliphs and sultans between the eighth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonner|Ener|Singer|2003|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruano|Burgos|1992|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebra]] was significantly developed by Persian scientist [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] during this time in his landmark text, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala]]'', from which the term ''algebra'' is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eglash|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Greek mathematician [[Diophantus]] has also been given this title. The terms [[algorism]] and [[algorithm]] are derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was also responsible for introducing the [[Arabic numerals]] and [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] beyond the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Arab]] scientist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) developed an early [[scientific method]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally [[empiricism|empirical]] orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham's [[empirical]] proof of the intromission theory of light (that is, that light rays entered the eyes rather than being [[emission theory (vision)|emitted by them]]) was particularly important. Alhazen was significant in the [[history of scientific method]], particularly in his approach to experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referred to as the &quot;world's first true scientist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Khalili|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medicine in medieval Islam]] was an area of science that advanced particularly during the Abbasids' reign. During the 9th century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of anatomy and diseases were made. The clinical distinction between [[measles]] and [[smallpox]] was described during this time. Famous Persian scientist [[Ibn Sina]] (known to the West as [[Avicenna]]) produced treatises and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and was very influential through his encyclopedias, ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' and ''[[The Book of Healing]]''. The work of him and many others directly influenced the research of European scientists during the [[Renaissance]].

[[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] was advanced by [[Al-Battani]], who improved the precision of the measurement of the [[precession]] of the Earth's axis. The corrections made to the [[geocentric model]] by al-Battani,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Averroes]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]] were later incorporated into the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rabin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrolabe]], though originally developed by the Greeks, was developed further by Islamic astronomers and engineers, and subsequently brought to medieval Europe.

[[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim alchemists]] influenced medieval European alchemists, particularly the writings attributed to [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber). A number of [[chemical process]]es such as [[distillation]] techniques were developed in the Muslim world and then spread to Europe.

[[File:More tales from the Arabian nights-14566176968.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration from ''More tales from the Arabian nights'' (1915)]]

The best known fiction from the Islamic world is ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of fantastical folk tales, legends and parables compiled primarily during the Abbassid era. The collection is recorded as having originated from an Arabic translation of a Sassanian era Persian prototype, with likely origins in Indian literary traditions. Stories from [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Mesopotamia]]n, and [[Egyptian literature|Egyptian]] folklore and literature were later incorporated. The epic is believed to have taken shape in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Grant | Clute | 1999 | p = 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All Arabian [[fantasy]] tales were often called &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights&quot;/&gt; This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by [[Antoine Galland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Camp|1976|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many imitations were written, especially in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|Clute|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]].

A famous example of Islamic poetry on [[romance (love)|romance]] was ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', an originally [[Arabic]] story which was further developed by [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] and other poets in the [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clinton|2000|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying love much like the later ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Arabic poetry reached its greatest height in the Abbasid era, especially before the loss of central authority and the rise of the Persianate dynasties. Writers like [[Abu Tammam]] and [[Abu Nuwas]] were closely connected to the caliphal court in Baghdad during the early 9th century, while others such as [[al-Mutanabbi]] received their patronage from regional courts.

===Settlement===
[[File:Leadville, from California Gulch, by Thurlow, J., 1831-1878.jpg|thumb|Leadville, as viewed from California Gulch - early photo, date unknown]]

The Leadville area was first settled in 1859 when [[Placer deposit|placer]] [[gold]] was discovered in [[California Gulch]] during the [[Pikes Peak Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeadvilleCGS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://coloradogeologicalsurvey.org/mineral-resources/historic-mining-districts/lake-county/leadville/ | title=Leadville | publisher=Colorado Geological Survey | access-date=28 July 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905184441/http://coloradogeologicalsurvey.org/mineral-resources/historic-mining-districts/lake-county/leadville/ | archive-date=5 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860, a town, [[Oro City, Colorado|Oro City]] (''oro'' is the Spanish word for gold), located about a mile from present-day Leadville, had sprung up, and a year later its population had reached more than 5,000. But the boom was brief because the placer-mined gold soon ran out, and Oro City never became a major settlement.

The early miners had noted that mining for placer gold was hampered by heavy black sand in the [[sluice box]]es, and in 1874 it was discovered that the heavy sand that impeded gold recovery was the [[lead]] mineral [[cerussite]], which has a high [[silver]] content. Prospectors traced the cerussite to its source, present day Leadville, and by 1876 had discovered several silver-lead [[lode]] deposits.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeadvilleCGS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of America1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/co-leadville.html | title=Leadville - Cloud City USA | access-date=27 July 2014 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702043009/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/co-leadville.html | archive-date=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horace Tabor]], who became known as the &quot;Leadville Silver King&quot;, and his wife [[Augusta Tabor|Augusta]] were among the first prospectors to arrive in Oro City. Tabor tried his luck at prospecting while his wife worked as a camp cook, laundress, banker and postmistress.

===Founding of Leadville===

The photograph is titled &quot;Capitol Hill Leadville&quot; in manuscript on the reverse. The image looks down on the center of Leadville with the &quot;Eighth Avenue Motel&quot; visible at the center of the photo. Extensive mining works can be seen on the hill that rises on the far side of the town.]]

Leadville was founded in 1877 by mine owners Horace Tabor and [[August Meyer]] at the start of the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The town was built on desolate flat land below the [[tree line]]. The first miners lived in a rough tented camp near the silver deposits in California Gulch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nomination Form&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= {{NRHP url|id=66000248}} | format = pdf |title= National register of historic places inventory Nomination form|publisher = National Park Service| access-date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the settlement was called &quot;Slabtown&quot;, but when the residents petitioned for a post office the name &quot;Leadville&quot; was chosen. By 1880 Tabor and Meyer's new town had gas lighting, water mains and {{convert|28|mi}} of streets, five churches, three hospitals, six banks, and a school for 1,100 students. Many business buildings were constructed with bricks hauled in by wagons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denver and Rio Grande&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghostdepot.com/rg/mainline/tennessee%20route/leadville%20history.htm | title=Leadville District History | publisher=Denver and Rio Grande | access-date=26 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022053/http://www.ghostdepot.com/rg/mainline/tennessee%20route/leadville%20history.htm | archive-date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- But census states roughly 18.000, see below!--&gt;

The first post office was in Tabor's store at Oro, and Augusta Tabor was the postmistress. Carriers went down to Denver one week and tried to come back the next. Postage was fifty cents a letter. In early 1878, Meyer, Harrison,&lt;ref&gt;Who is this?&lt;/ref&gt; and Tabor established a post office in Leadville, with Henderson as postmaster. The post office and the telegraph office both prospered.

The town's first newspaper was ''The Reveille'', a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] weekly, in 1878. Three months later, a competing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] weekly, ''The Eclipse'', emerged. ''The Chronicle'' was the town's first daily and first newspaper in America to employ a full-time female reporter. Like the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', ''The Chronicle'' took the lead in outing criminals and thieves, in an attempt to clean up the town's shady business culture. Despite violent threats, the ''Chronicle'' survived without major incident.
[[File:INTERIOR OF TABOR OPERA HOUSE, LEADVILLE HISTORIC DISTRICT.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Tabor Opera House]]

William Nye opened the first [[Western saloon|saloon]] in 1877, and it was followed by many others. The same year the Coliseum Novelty was the first theater to open. It offered sleeping rooms upstairs for a nightly rate and provided a variety of entertainments: dancing girls, dogfights, cockfighting, wrestling and boxing matches, and rooms for gambling. In June 1881, it burned to the ground. Ben Wood, who arrived in Leadville in 1878, opened the first legitimate theater, Wood's Opera House, with a thousand seats. It was a first-class theater, where gentleman removed their hats and did not smoke or drink in the presence of a lady. Less than a year later, Wood opened the Windsor Hotel. His opera house was regarded as the largest and best theater constructed in the [[Western United States|West]], an honor it held until the opening of the Tabor Opera House. Horace Tabor's Opera House was the most costly structure in Colorado at the time. Building materials were brought by wagons from Denver. The massive three-story opera house, constructed of stone, brick, and iron, opened on November 20, 1879. Tabor, originally from [[Vermont]], became the town's first mayor. After striking it rich, he had an estimated net worth of 10 million dollars and was known for his extravagant lifestyle.
[[Image:Matchless mine.jpg|thumb|Matchless mine and Baby Doe Tabor cabin]]

In 1883 Horace Tabor divorced his wife of 25 years and married [[Baby Doe Tabor|Baby Doe McCourt]], who was half his age. Tabor was by then a [[United States Senate|US senator]], and the divorce and marriage caused a scandal in Colorado and beyond. For several years the couple lived a lavish lifestyle in a Denver mansion.  But Tabor, one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, lost his fortune when the repeal of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] caused the [[Panic of 1893]]. He died destitute but remained convinced that the price of silver would rebound. According to legend he told Baby Doe to &quot;hold on the Matchless mine ... it will make millions again when silver comes back.&quot; She returned to Leadville with her daughters, Silver Dollar and Lily, where she spent the rest of her life believing Tabor's prediction. At one time the &quot;best dressed woman in the West&quot;, she lived in a cabin at the Matchless Mine for the last three decades of her life. After a snowstorm in March 1935, she was found frozen in her cabin, aged about 81 years.

===Mining and smelting===
[[File:Gold-d06-206a.jpg|thumb|150px|Crystalline [[gold]] specimen from the Little Johnny Mine, Breece Hill, [[Leadville mining district]]]]

Mining in the Leadville area began in 1859 when prospectors discovered gold at the mouth of [[California Gulch]]. By 1872, placer mining in California Gulch yielded more than $2,500,000, roughly equivalent to $47,674,478 today. In 1876, [[black sand]], once considered bothersome to placer gold miners, was discovered to contain lead carbonates, leading to a rush of miners to the area and the founding of the town in 1877. By 1880, Leadville was one of the world's largest and richest silver camps, with a population of more than 15,000. Income from more than thirty mines and ten large [[smelting]] works produced gold, silver, and lead amounting to $15,000,000 annually.

According to one historian of the era, &quot;The outpouring of the precious metal from Leadville transformed the struggling Centennial State into a veritable autocrat in the colony of states. As if by magic the rough frontier town of Denver became a metropolis; stately buildings arose on the site of shanties; crystal streams flowed through the arid plains and the desert blossomed and became fruitful. Poverty gave way to the annoyance of wealth and the fame of silver state spread throughout the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conant, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Swindles were not uncommon in the mining community. When the Little Pittsburg mine was exhausted of its rich ore body, its managers sold their shares while concealing the mine's actual condition from the other stockholders. &quot;Chicken Bill&quot; Lovell dumped a wheelbarrow load of silver-rich ore into a barren pit on his Chrysolite claim in order to sell it to Horace Tabor for a large price. Tabor had the last laugh when his miners dug a few feet farther and discovered a rich ore body. Some time later the manager of the Chrysolite mine fooled an outside mining engineer into overestimating the mine's ore reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miningswindles.com/html/leadville.html |title=Leadville |website=www.miningswindles.com |access-date=28 April 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622214901/http://www.miningswindles.com/html/leadville.html |archive-date=22 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's fortunes declined with the repeal of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] in 1893, although afterwards there was another small gold boom. Mining companies came to rely increasingly on income from the [[lead]] and [[zinc]]. The district is credited with producing over 2.9 million troy ounces of gold, 240 million troy ounces of [[silver]], 1 million short tons of lead, 785 thousand short tons of zinc, and 53 thousand short tons of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Tweto (1968), &quot;Leadville district, Colorado&quot;, in ''Ore Deposits in the United States 1933/1967'', New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.683.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Climax-Mine-1924.png|thumb|Climax molybdenum mine, Colorado, circa 1924 (USGS photo)]]
A bitter [[Leadville miners' strike|strike by Leadville's hard rock miners]] in 1896–97 led to bloodshed, at least five deaths, and the burning of the Coronado Mine. In a letter to a London business contact, mine owner [[Eben Smith]] wrote, &quot;The strikers got the worst of it in the raid on the Coronado and Emmet [mines], there were 10 or 12 killed; we do not know how many, and a great number wounded; they take care of their wounded the same as the Indians but every now and then a fellow turns up that the rats have been eating or who has gone to decay that we know must have been shot ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, &quot;The Lessons of Leadville&quot;, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 4, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II caused an increase in the demand for [[molybdenum]], used to harden steel. It was mined at the nearby [[Climax mine]], which at one time produced 75 percent of the world's output. By 1980 the Climax Mine was the largest underground mine in the world. Taxes paid by the mine provided Leadville with good schools and libraries, and provided employment for many residents. When the market dropped in 1981, Leadville's economy suffered and many people lost their jobs. With little industry other than the tourist trade, most of the former miners left and the standard of living declined. Climax reopened in 2008 and started production in 2010. It currently is the most efficient mine producing the metal in Colorado and is estimated to have a production life of thirty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado Central Magazine1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cozine.com/2006-june/restarting-climax-the-who-when-and-why/ | title=Restarting Climax: The who, when, and why | date=June 2006 | access-date=26 July 2014 | author=Voynick, Steve | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808071817/http://cozine.com/2006-june/restarting-climax-the-who-when-and-why/ | archive-date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many years of mining left behind substantial contamination of the soil and water and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] designated some former mines as [[Superfund]] sites, such as [[California Gulch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0801478 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813233923/https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0801478 |archive-date=2016-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2019 the EPA reports:  &quot;A vast majority of the cleanup at the site has been completed, so current risk of exposure is low. Pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are still encouraged to have their blood-lead levels checked.&quot;[https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData2.cfm?id=0801478#Risk]

===Leadville's colorful past===
[[File:Mart J. Duggan.jpg|thumb|left|Mart J. Duggan]]

As the population boomed, by 1878 Leadville had the reputation as one of the most lawless towns in the [[American frontier|West]].{{By whom|date=August 2017}} The first city marshal was run out of town a few days after he was appointed, and his replacement was shot dead within a month by one of his deputies. Fearing the town would be lost to the lawless element, Mayor Horace Tabor sent for [[Mart Duggan]], who was living in Denver, as a replacement. Duggan is little-known today, but was well known at the time as a fearless gunfighter. Using strong-arm and lawless tactics, during his two stints as marshal Duggan brought order to Leadville by 1880 when he stepped down. He was shot and killed in 1888 by an unknown assailant, most likely an enemy he had made when he was a Leadville marshal. Historian Robert Dearment writes, &quot;Mart Duggan was a quick-shooting, hard-drinking, brawling tough Irish man, but he was exactly the kind of man a tough, hard-drinking, quick-shooting camp like Leadville needed in its earliest days. His name is all but forgotten today, but the name '[[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Matt Dillon]]' is recognized around the world. Such are the vagaries of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadly Dozen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuwVBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=mart+duggan+lawman+in+leadville+colorado&amp;pg=PT37 | title=Deadly Dozen | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | access-date=3 September 2015 | author=Dearment, Robert K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Poker Alice Ivers.jpg|thumb|Poker Alice Ivers]]
Alice Ivers, better known as [[Poker Alice]], was a card player and dealer of the Old West who learned her trade in Leadville. Born in [[Devonshire, Blackpool|Devonshire]], her family moved to America when she was a small girl. They first settled in [[Virginia]], where she attended an elite girls' boarding school. When she was a teenager, her family moved to Leadville when the silver boom drew hundreds of new residents to the area. At the age of twenty she married a mining engineer who, like many of the men at that time, frequented the numerous gambling halls in Leadville. Alice went along, at first just observing, but eventually she began to sit in on the games as well. After a few years of marriage her husband was killed in a mining accident and she turned to cards to support herself. Alice was attractive, dressed in the latest fashions, and was in great demand as a dealer. Eventually Alice left Leadville to travel the gambling circuit, as was common of the male gamblers of that time. She continued to dress in the latest fashions but took to smoking cigars. Well known throughout the West, gambling halls welcomed her because she was good for business. In her later years, Alice claimed to have won more than $250,000 at the gaming tables and never once cheated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of America2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-pokeralice.html | title=Poker Alice - Famous Frontier Gambler | publisher=Legends of America | access-date=30 October 2015 | author=Weiser, Kathy | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026173231/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-pokeralice.html | archive-date=26 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas Jack Omohundro]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] scout, cowboy and stage actor with [[Buffalo Bill|&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody's]] travelling revue, died of [[pneumonia]] a month before his 34th birthday in summer 1880 in Leadville where he was living on a small estate with his wife, ballerina [[Giuseppina Morlacchi]].

Around 1883, shortly after the gun fight at the [[O.K. Corral]], [[Doc Holliday]] moved to Leadville where he dealt [[faro (card game)|faro]]. On August 19, 1884, he shot ex-Leadville policeman Billy Allen, who had threatened him for failing to pay a $5 debt. Despite overwhelming evidence implicating him, a jury found Holliday not guilty of the shooting or attempted murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado Central Magazine2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cozine.com/2012-may/the-fading-of-a-legend-doc-holliday-in-leadville/ | title=The Fading of a Legend: Doc Holliday in Leadville | publisher=Colorado Central Magazine | date=1 May 2012 | access-date=4 September 2015 | author=Price, Charles F. | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103216/http://cozine.com/2012-may/the-fading-of-a-legend-doc-holliday-in-leadville/ | archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunfighter and professional gambler [[Luke Short]] also spent time in Leadville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frontier Gambler&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frontiergamblers.com/page44.php | title=Luke Short | publisher=Frontier Gambler | access-date=4 September 2015 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505083009/http://www.frontiergamblers.com/page44.php | archive-date=5 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown]], who became known as &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, moved to Leadville when she was 18. In 1886 she married a mining engineer who was twelve years older, James J. Brown. The Brown family acquired great wealth in 1893 when Brown was instrumental in the discovery of a substantial gold ore seam at the Little Jonny Mine.
[[File:Gold (Little Jonny Mine, Breece Hill, Leadville, Colorado, USA) (17161825282).jpg|thumb|left|Gold (Little Jonny Mine - Leadville, Colorado)]]

The mine was owned by his employers, the Ibex Mining Company. Margaret Brown became famous because of her survival of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|1912 sinking]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], after exhorting the crew of {{nowrap|[[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 6 (port)|Lifeboat No. 6]]}} to return to look for survivors. A [[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|1960 Broadway musical]] based on her life was produced, along with a [[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (film)|1964 film]] adaptation of the musical, both titled ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown''. Her home in Denver has been preserved as the Molly Brown House Museum.

[[Meyer Guggenheim]] of the [[Guggenheim family]] started out in Leadville in mining and [[smelting]]. The family went on to possess one of the largest fortunes in the world. Family members have become known for their philanthropy in diverse areas such as modern art and aviation, including several [[Guggenheim Museums]].

[[Oscar Wilde]] appeared at the Tabor Opera House during his 1882 American [[Aesthetic Movement]] lecture tour. The reviews were mixed, and the press satirized Wilde in cartoons as an English [[dandy]] decorated with [[sunflower]]s and [[lilies]], the floral emblems of the Aesthetic Movement. A [[Kansas]] newspaper described the event:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oscar Wilde's visit to Leadville excited a great deal of interest and curiosity. The Tabor-opera house where he lectured was packed full. It was rumored that an attempt would be made by a number of young men to ridicule him by coming to the lecture in exaggerated costume with enormous sunflowers and lilies and to introduce a number of characters in the costume of the Western &quot;bad men&quot;. Probably, however, better counsel prevailed and no disturbance took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscar Wilde in America&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | title=Oscar Wilde in America | work=A Selected Resource of Oscar Wilde's Visits to America | access-date=3 September 2015 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918214406/http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | archive-date=18 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayor David H. Dougan invited Wilde to tour the [[Matchless Mine]] and name its new lode &quot;The Oscar&quot;. Wilde later recounted a visit to a local saloon, &quot;where I saw the only rational method of art criticism I have ever come across. Over the piano was printed a notice – 'Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | title=Oscar Wilde in Leadville | access-date=23 February 2015 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062252/http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | archive-date=24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-mining era===
[[Image:Leadville &amp; the Hotel Vendome , Colorado , 1950s , Kodachrome by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|200px|Leadville in the 1950s]]

The town has made major efforts to improve its economy by encouraging tourism and emphasizing its history and opportunities for outdoor recreation. The [[National Mining Hall of Fame|National Mining Museum and Hall of Fame]] opened in 1987 with a federal charter. The town's altitude and rugged terrain contributes to a number of challenging racing events, such as the [[Leadville Trail 100]] series of races. It is often used as a base for [[altitude training]] and hosts a number of other events for [[running|runners]] and [[mountain bike|mountain bicyclists]].

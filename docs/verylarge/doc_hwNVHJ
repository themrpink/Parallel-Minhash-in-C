[[Samuel Pepys]] saw a ''Henry V'' in 1664, but it was written by [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], not by Shakespeare. Shakespeare's play returned to the stage in 1723, in an adaptation by [[Aaron Hill (writer)|Aaron Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest-running production of the play in Broadway history was the staging starring [[Richard Mansfield]] in 1900 which ran for 54 performances. Other notable stage performances of ''Henry V'' include [[Charles Kean]] (1859), [[Charles Alexander Calvert]] (1872), and [[Walter Hampden]] (1928).

==Adaptations==

=== Film ===
Three major film adaptations have been made. The first, [[Henry V (1944 film)|''Henry V'' (1944)]], directed by and starring [[Laurence Olivier]], is a colourful and highly stylised version which begins in the [[Globe Theatre]] and then gradually shifts to a realistic evocation of the [[Battle of Agincourt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gurr48&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=King Henry V|series=New Cambridge Shakespeare|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-84792-3|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olivier's film was made during the [[Second World War]] and was intended as a patriotic rallying cry at the time of the [[invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gurr48&quot; /&gt;

The second major film, [[Henry V (1989 film)|''Henry V'' (1989)]], directed by and starring [[Kenneth Branagh]], attempts to give a more realistic evocation of the period, and lays more emphasis on the horrors of war. It features a mud-spattered and gruesome Battle of Agincourt.

The third major film, ''[[The King (2019 film)|The King]]'' (2019), starring [[Timothée Chalamet]] as Henry V, was adapted from Shakespeare's plays ''Henry IV Part I'', ''Henry IV Part II'', and ''Henry V''.

=== Dance ===
In 2004, post-modern choreographer [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]] created a [[dance-theatre]] version of the play called ''Dancing Henry Five'', which mixed [[William Walton]]'s music written for the Olivier film, recorded speeches from the film itself and by [[Christopher Plummer]], and commentary written by Gordon.  The piece premiered at [[Danspace Project]] in New York, where it was compared favorably to a production of ''Henry IV'' (parts 1 and 2) at [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rockwell|Rockwell, John]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/16/movies/reverberations-three-shakespeares-each-with-a-purpose-each-hoping-to-thrill.html?scp=3&amp;sq=dancing+henry+five&amp;st=nyt &quot;Reverberations: Three Shakespeares, Each With a Purpose, Each Hoping to Thrill&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' (16 January 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revived three times—in 2005, 2007, and 2011—playing cities across the United States, and received a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] American Masterpieces in Dance Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/10grants/am10.php?disc=Dance &quot;FY 2010 Grant Awards: American Masterpieces: Dance&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012024840/http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/10grants/am10.php?disc=Dance |date=12 October 2011 }} on the National Endowment for the Arts website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
''[[Suite from Henry V]]'' is a 1963 orchestral arrangement of music that composer [[William Walton]] wrote for the 1944 Olivier film.  The arrangement is by [[Muir Mathieson]], and is in five movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serotsky|first1=Paul|title=Walton – Suite: &quot;Henry V&quot; notes by Paul Serotsky|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Programme_Notes/walton_henryv.htm|website=MusicWeb International|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Henry V – A Shakespeare Scenario'' is a 50-minute work for narrator, SATB chorus, boys' choir (optional), and full orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry V – A Shakespeare Scenario – Vocal and orchestral parts|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780193385320.do|website=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The musical content is taken from Walton's score for the Olivier film, edited by [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]] and arranged by [[Christopher Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson |first1=Don |title=Henry V: A Shakespeare Scenario |url=http://tso.ca/en-ca/Discover-the-Music/Programme-Notes/Henry-V-A-Shakespeare-Scenario.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150414205420/http://tso.ca/en-ca/Discover-the-Music/Programme-Notes/Henry-V-A-Shakespeare-Scenario.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 April 2015 |website=Toronto Symphony Orchestra |accessdate=31 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London, in May 1990.  Performers for this premiere were [[Christopher Plummer]] (narrator), the Academy Chorus, Choristers of [[Westminster Cathedral]], and [[Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. The conductor was Sir [[Neville Marriner]].  A CD of the work with these performers was released by Chandos in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chandos release of Henry V A Shakespeare Scenario|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/william-walton-henry-v-mw0001860612|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''O For a Muse of Fire'' is a symphonic overture for full orchestra and vocal soloist, written by [[Darryl Kubian]].  The work is 12 minutes long, and was premiered by the [[New Jersey Symphony Orchestra]] in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Adam|title=Kubian, Rachmaninoff &amp; Tchaikovsky NJSO at BergenPAC|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/new-jersey/article/BWW-Reviews-KUBIAN-RACHMANINOFF-TCHAIKOVSKY-NJSO-at-BergenPAC-20150323#|accessdate=31 March 2015|website=Broadway World|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reich|first1=Ronnie|title=The NJSO plays Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Kubian|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/03/the_njso_plays_rachmaninoff_tchaikovsky_and_kubian.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=The Star Ledger|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is scored for full orchestra, with vocal soloist. The vocal part incorporates selected lines from the text, and the vocal range is adaptable to different voice types. The soloist for the premiere performances with the New Jersey Symphony was former [[October Project]] lead singer (and former [[Sony Classical]] artist) [[Mary Fahl]].

==History of terminology==
*1916 – The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by J. Arthur Harris in &quot;The Variable Desert,&quot; Scientific American, {{jstor|6182}}: &quot;The bare statement that the region contains a flora rich in genera and species and of diverse geographic origin or affinity is entirely inadequate as a description of its real biological diversity.&quot;
*1975 – The term ''natural diversity'' was introduced (by The Science Division of The Nature Conservancy in a 1975 study, &quot;The Preservation of Natural Diversity.&quot;){{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
*1980 – [[Thomas Lovejoy]] introduced the term ''biological diversity'' to the scientific community in a book.&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunder*land, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly became commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E.

==Definitions==
===Prior term===
&quot;Biodiversity&quot; is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Brian H.|date=1992|title=Biodiversity and Ecological Redundancy|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18–23|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.610018.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate terms===
Biologists most often define biodiversity as the &quot;totality of [[gene]]s, [[species]] and [[ecosystems]] of a region&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsson2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|access-date=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|access-date=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:
* [[taxonomic diversity]] (usually measured at the species diversity level)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot; /&gt;
* [[ecological diversity]] (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot; /&gt;
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|access-date = 22 December 2015|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy.

===Wilcox 1982===
An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilcox84&quot; /&gt; Wilcox's definition was &quot;Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...&quot;.&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;
Wilcox, Bruce A. 1984. In situ conservation of genetic resources: determinants of minimum area requirements. ''In National Parks, Conservation and Development, Proceedings of the World Congress on National Parks, J.A. McNeely and K.R. Miller'', Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 18–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic: Wilcox 1984===
Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

===United Nations 1992===
The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined &quot;biological diversity&quot; as &quot;the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, ''inter alia'', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawksworth1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

===Gaston and Spicer 2004===
Gaston &amp; Spicer's definition in their book &quot;Biodiversity: an introduction&quot; is &quot;variation of life at all levels of biological organization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GastonSpicer2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Map latitudinal gradient of biodiversity mannion 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of living terrestrial vertebrate species, highest concentration of diversity shown in red in equatorial regions, declining polewards (towards the blue end of the spectrum) (Mannion 2014)]]
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on [[temperature]], [[precipitation]], [[altitude]], [[soil]]s, [[geography]] and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MorandKrasnov2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;the-functional-role-of-producer-diversity&quot; /&gt;

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally. [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times| date=20 January 2010 | access-date=2 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;journal.pone.0008767&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Global Conservation Significance of Ecuador's Yasuní National Park |author1=Margot S.

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher [[latitude]]s. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological factors may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages = 1771–1792 | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis (&quot;the [[fractal]] biodiversity&quot;) was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cazzolla Gatti | first1 = R | year = 2016 | title = The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient | journal = Biologia | volume = 71 | issue = 6| pages = 669–672 | doi = 10.1515/biolog-2016-0077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hyper volumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises to three moving towards the [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cogitore, Clément (1983-....).|title=Hypothesis|oclc=968249007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hotspots===
A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 | s2cid = 2370659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 | s2cid = 22995882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages = 1098–1101 | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T | s2cid=4424240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKee2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|access-date=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

The Atlantic slave trade is customarily divided into two eras, known as the First and Second Atlantic Systems. Slightly more than 3% of the enslaved people exported from Africa were traded between 1525 and 1600, and 16% in the 17th century.

The First Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans to, primarily, South American colonies of the Portuguese and Spanish empires. During the first Atlantic system, most of these traders were Portuguese, giving them a near-monopoly. Initially the slaves were transported to [[Seville]] or [[Canary Islands]], but from 1525 slaves were transported directly from the island [[Sao Tomé]] across the Atlantic to [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.institutomora.edu.mx/Documentos_RHITMO/Atlantic-History-and-the-Slave-Trade-to-Spanish-America.pdf Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America by ALEX BORUCKI, DAVID ELTIS, AND DAVID WHEAT, p. 446, 457, 460]&lt;/ref&gt; Decisive was the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] which did not allow Spanish ships in African ports. Spain had to rely on Portuguese ships and sailors to bring slaves across the Atlantic. Around 1560 the Portuguese began a regular slave trade to Brazil. From 1580 till 1640 Portugal was temporarily united with Spain in the [[Iberian Union]]. Most Portuguese contractors who obtained the asiento between 1580 and 1640 were [[conversos]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (2002). ''Diasporas within the Diaspora. Jews, Crypto-Jews and the World Maritime Empires (1510–1740)''.&lt;/ref&gt; For Portuguese merchants, many of whom were &quot;[[New Christians]]&quot; or their descendants, the union of crowns presented commercial opportunities in the slave trade to Spanish America.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', p. 225, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wiznitzer, ''the Jews of Colonial Brazil''. New York: 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the middle of the 17th century Mexico was the largest single market for slaves in Spanish America.&lt;ref name=rawley63&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQcOo4csdzEC&amp;pg=PA63 |title= The Transatlantic Slave Trade: A History |first1=James A. |last1=Rawley |first2=Stephen D. |last2=Behrendt |date= December 2005 |page=63 |isbn= 0803205120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples to Brazil, the Spanish empire relied on the [[Asiento de Negros]] system, awarding (Catholic) Genoese merchant bankers the license to trade enslaved people from Africa to their colonies in [[Spanish America]]. Cartagena, Veracruz, Buenos Aires, and Hispaniola received the majority of slave arrivals, mainly from Angola.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.institutomora.edu.mx/Documentos_RHITMO/Atlantic-History-and-the-Slave-Trade-to-Spanish-America.pdf Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America by ALEX BORUCKI, DAVID ELTIS, AND DAVID WHEAT ], p. 437, 446&lt;/ref&gt; This division of the slave trade between Spain and Portugal upset the British and the Dutch who invested in the [[British West Indies]] and [[Dutch Brazil]] producing sugar. After the Iberian union fell apart, Spain prohibited Portugal from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier. According the [[Peace of Münster|Treaty of Munster]] the slave trade was opened for the traditional enemies of Spain, losing a large share of the trade to the Dutch, French and English. For 150 years Spanish transatlantic traffic was operating at trivial levels. In many years, not a single Spanish slave voyage set sail from Africa. Unlike all of their imperial competitors, the Spanish almost never delivered slaves to foreign territories. By contrast, the British, and the Dutch before them, sold slaves everywhere in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.institutomora.edu.mx/Documentos_RHITMO/Atlantic-History-and-the-Slave-Trade-to-Spanish-America.pdf Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America by ALEX BORUCKI, DAVID ELTIS, AND DAVID WHEAT ], p. 453-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans by mostly English, French and Dutch traders and investors.&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Emmer, ''The Dutch in the Atlantic Economy, 1580–1880. Trade, Slavery and Emancipation'' (1998), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] islands [[Curaçao]], Jamaica and [[Martinique]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Klein 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.institutomora.edu.mx/Documentos_RHITMO/Atlantic-History-and-the-Slave-Trade-to-Spanish-America.pdf Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America by ALEX BORUCKI, DAVID ELTIS, AND DAVID WHEAT ], p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; In 1672 the [[Royal Africa Company]] was founded; in 1674 the [[Dutch West India Company#New West India Company|New West India Company]] became deeper involved in slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/africa_caribbean/docs/account_rac.htmThe Royal African Company Trades for Commodities Along the West African Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1677 the [[Compagnie du Sénégal]], used [[Gorée]] to [[house of Slaves|house the slaves]].

Following [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the British]] and [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|United States' bans]] on the African slave trade in 1807, it declined, but the period after still accounted for 28.5% of the total volume of the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E., &quot;The Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade.

===Triangular trade===
{{Main|Triangular trade}}

The first side of the triangle was the export of goods from Europe to Africa. A number of African kings and merchants took part in the trading of enslaved people from 1440 to about 1833. For each captive, the African rulers would receive a variety of goods from Europe. These included guns, ammunition, alcohol, [[Indigo dye#History|Indigo died]] Indian textiles, and other factory-made goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-06-27|title=Indian cotton textiles in the eighteenth-century Atlantic economy|url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/southasia/2013/06/27/indian-cotton-textiles-in-the-eighteenth-century-atlantic-economy/|access-date=2020-09-09|website=South Asia@LSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second leg of the triangle exported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas and the Caribbean Islands. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas. The goods were the products of slave-labour plantations and included [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], [[molasses]] and [[rum]].&lt;ref name=Inikori&gt;{{cite book |title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe |first1=Joseph E. |last1=Inikori |first2=Stanley L. |last2=Engerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], considered the pioneer of the British slave trade, was the first to run the Triangular trade, making a profit at every stop.

===Labour and slavery===
[[File:BLAKE10.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Josiah Wedgwood#&quot;Am I Not a Man and a Brother?&quot;|&quot;''Am I Not a Man and a Brother?''&quot;]] 1787 medallion designed by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for the British anti-slavery campaign]]

The Atlantic slave trade was the result of, among other things, [[labour shortage]], itself in turn created by the desire of European colonists to exploit New World land and resources for capital profits. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native]] peoples were at first utilized as slave labour by Europeans until a large number died from overwork and [[Old World]] diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Through History |url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029184350/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701508643/Smallpox_Through_History.html |archive-date=2009-10-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative sources of labour, such as [[indentured servitude]], failed to provide a sufficient workforce.
Many crops could not be sold for profit, or even grown, in Europe. Exporting crops and goods from the New World to Europe often proved to be more profitable than producing them on the European mainland. A vast amount of labour was needed to create and sustain plantations that required intensive labour to grow, harvest, and process prized tropical crops. [[West Africa|Western Africa]] (part of which became known as &quot;the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]&quot;), Angola and nearby Kingdoms and later [[Central Africa]], became the source for enslaved people to meet the demand for labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/Kongo_History.htm|title=History Kingdom of Kongo|website=www.africafederation.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic reason for the constant shortage of labour was that, with much cheap land available and many landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves relatively quickly, thus increasing the need for workers.&lt;ref&gt;Solow, Barbara (ed.) (1991). ''Slavery and the Rise of the Atlantic System'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] attributed the use of slave labour in part to the climate, and the consequent idle leisure afforded by slave labour: &quot;For in a warm climate, no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefVirg.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=18&amp;division=div1|title=''Notes on the State of Virginia'' Query 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 paper, economist Elena Esposito argued that the enslavement of Africans in colonial America was attributable to the fact that the American south was sufficiently warm and humid for malaria to thrive; the disease had debilitating effects on the European settlers. Conversely, many enslaved Africans were taken from regions of Africa which hosted particularly potent strains of the disease, so the Africans had already developed natural resistance to malaria. This, Esposito argued, resulted in higher malaria survival rates in the American south among enslaved Africans than among European labourers, making them a more profitable source of labour and encouraging their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Esposito |first=Elena |url=http://eh.net/eha/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Esposito.pdf |title=Side Effects of Immunities: the African Slave Trade |type=Working Paper |date=2015 |publisher=Economic History Association |access-date=May 7, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian David Eltis argues that Africans were enslaved because of cultural beliefs in Europe that prohibited the enslavement of cultural insiders, even if there was a source of labour that could be enslaved (such as convicts, prisoners of war and vagrants). Eltis argues that traditional beliefs existed in Europe against enslaving Christians (few Europeans not being Christian at the time) and those slaves that existed in Europe tended to be non-Christians and their immediate descendants (since a slave converting to Christianity did not guarantee emancipation) and thus by the fifteenth century Europeans as a whole came to be regarded as insiders. Eltis argues that while all slave societies have demarked insiders and outsiders, Europeans took this process further by extending the status of insider to the entire European continent, rendering it unthinkable to enslave a European since this would require enslaving an insider. Conversely, Africans were viewed as outsiders and thus qualified for enslavement. While Europeans may have treated some types of labour, such as convict labour, with conditions similar to that of slaves, these labourers would not be regarded as chattel and their progeny could not inherit their subordinate status, thus not making them slaves in the eyes of Europeans. The status of chattel slavery was thus confined to non-Europeans, such as Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Eltis, David. The rise of African slavery in the Americas.

===African participation in the slave trade===
[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gorée-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|Slave traders in [[Gorée]], Senegal, 18th century.]]
Africans played a direct role in the slave trade, kidnapping adults and stealing children for the purpose of selling them, through intermediaries, to Europeans or their agents.&lt;ref name=afbis&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm |title=Slave trade: a root of contemporary African Crisis|journal=Africa Economic Analysis|year=2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502172215/http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm|archive-date=2012-05-02|last=Obadina|first=Tunde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those sold into slavery were usually from a different ethnic group than those who captured them, whether enemies or just neighbors.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These captive slaves were considered &quot;other&quot;, not part of the people of the ethnic group or &quot;tribe&quot;; African kings were only interested in protecting their own ethnic group, but sometimes criminals would be sold to get rid of them. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans.&lt;ref name=afbis/&gt; But some African kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals. King [[Jaja of Opobo]], a former slave, refused to do any business with the slavers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{explain|date=September 2020}}

According to Pernille Ipsen, author of ''Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast,'' [[Ghanaian]]s also participated in the slave trade through intermarriage, or ''[[cassare]]'' (taken from Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese), meaning 'to set up house'. It is derived from the Portuguese word 'casar', meaning 'to marry'. ''Cassare'' formed political and economic bonds between European and African slave traders. ''Cassare'' was a pre-European-contact practice used to integrate the &quot;other&quot; from a differing African tribe. Early on in the Atlantic slave trade, it was common for the powerful elite West African families to &quot;marry&quot;-off their women to the European traders in alliance, bolstering their syndicate. The marriages were even performed using African customs, which Europeans did not object to, seeing how important the connections were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ipsen|first1=Pernille|title=Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast|date=2015|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4673-5|pages=1, 21, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European participation in the slave trade===
Although Europeans were the market for slaves, Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of [[tropical diseases|disease]] and fierce African resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24159|title=Historical survey &gt; The international slave trade.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa, convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement, a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative. Since most of these nations did not have a prison system, convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local domestic slave market.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Slavery in Africa and the New World contrasted===
{{further|Slavery in Africa}}
Forms of slavery varied both in Africa and in the New World. In general, slavery in Africa was not heritable—that is, the children of slaves were free—while in the Americas, children of slave mothers were considered born into slavery. This was connected to another distinction: slavery in West Africa was not reserved for racial or religious minorities, as it was in European colonies, although the case was otherwise in places such as [[African slave trade#Slavery in Somalia|Somalia]], where [[Bantu people|Bantus]] were taken as slaves for the ethnic [[Somali people|Somalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Winant]] (2001), ''The World is a Ghetto: Race and Democracy Since World War II'', Basic Books, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'' (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of slaves in Africa was more variable than in the Americas. At one extreme, the kings of Dahomey routinely slaughtered slaves in hundreds or thousands in sacrificial rituals, and slaves as human sacrifices were also known in [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, ed. (2005), ''Encyclopedia of African History,'' CRC Press, vol. 1, pp. 333–334; Nicolas Argenti (2007), ''The Intestines of the State: Youth, Violence and Belated Histories in the Cameroon Grassfields'', University of Chicago Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, slaves in other places were often treated as part of the family, &quot;adopted children&quot;, with significant rights including the right to marry without their masters' permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgambia.com/information/slave-treatment-rights-privileges.html Rights &amp; Treatment of Slaves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223234940/http://accessgambia.com/information/slave-treatment-rights-privileges.html |date=2010-12-23 }}.

{{quote|The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen. They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters ...

===Slave market regions and participation===
[[File:Africa slave Regions.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Major slave trading regions of Africa, 15th–19th centuries]]
There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the Western Hemisphere. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.2&amp;nbsp;million enslaved Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovejoy&quot;&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E. ''Transformations in Slavery''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] ([[Senegal]] and [[the Gambia]]): 4.8%
* [[Upper Guinea]] ([[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]): 4.1%
* [[Pepper Coast|Windward Coast]] ([[Liberia]] and [[Ivory Coast]]): 1.8%
* [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] ([[Ghana]] and east of [[Ivory Coast]]): 10.4%
* [[Bight of Benin]] ([[Togo]], [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]] west of the Niger Delta): 20.2%
* [[Bight of Biafra]] ([[Nigeria]] east of the [[Niger Delta]], [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]): 14.6%
* West Central Africa ([[Republic of Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Angola]]): 39.4%
* Southeastern Africa ([[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]]): 4.7%

Although the slave trade was largely global, there was considerable intracontinental slave trade in which 8 million people were enslaved within the African continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Economies, Societies and Peoples in Africa, the Americas, and Europe|last=Inikori|first=Joseph|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1992|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who did move out of Africa, 8 million were forced out of Eastern Africa to be sent to Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

===African kingdoms of the era===

There were over 173 city-states and kingdoms in the African regions affected by the slave trade between 1502 and 1853, when [[Brazil]] became the last Atlantic import nation to outlaw the slave trade. Of those 173, no fewer than 68 could be deemed nation states with political and military infrastructures that enabled them to dominate their neighbours. Nearly every present-day nation had a pre-colonial predecessor, sometimes an [[African empires|African empire]] with which European traders had to barter.

====Ethnic groups====
The different ethnic groups brought to the Americas closely correspond to the regions of heaviest activity in the slave trade. Over 45 distinct ethnic groups were taken to the Americas during the trade. Of the 45, the ten most prominent, according to slave documentation of the era are listed below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1= Midlo Hall |first1= Gwendolyn |author-link1= Gwendolyn Midlo Hall |title= Slavery and African Ethnicities in the Americas |url= http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=742 |access-date= 2011-01-24 |year= 2007 |publisher= [[University of North Carolina Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8078-5862-2 |page= {{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human toll==
The transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet unknown loss of life for African captives both in and outside the Americas. &quot;More than a million people are thought to have died&quot; during their transport to the [[New World]] according to a BBC report.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6445941.stm Quick guide: The slave trade; Who were the slaves?] BBC News, 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; More died soon after their arrival. The number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be enslaved.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The savage nature of the trade led to the destruction of individuals and cultures. The following figures do not include deaths of enslaved Africans as a result of their labour, slave revolts, or diseases suffered while living among New World populations. Historian [[Ana Lucia Araujo]] has noted that the process of enslavement did not end with arrival on Western Hemisphere shores; the different paths taken by the individuals and groups who were victims of the Atlantic slave trade were influenced by different factors—including the disembarking region, the ability to be sold on the market, the kind of work performed, gender, age, religion, and language.&lt;ref&gt;''Paths of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Interactions, Identities, and Images''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FreedmensInquiry&quot;&gt;[[American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission]] report, page 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Manning estimates that about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th century, but about 1.5 million died on board ship. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas. Besides the slaves who died on the Middle Passage, more Africans likely died during the slave raids in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young. Manning's estimate covers the 12 million who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million destined for Asian slave markets and the 8 million destined for African markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;online at pp. 119–120&quot;/&gt; Of the slaves shipped to [[Americas|The Americas]], the largest share went to Brazil and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, Angus.

According to Kimani Nehusi, the presence of European slavers affected the way in which the legal code in African societies responded to offenders. Crimes traditionally punishable by some other form of punishment became punishable by enslavement and sale to slave traders.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to [[David Stannard]]'s ''American Holocaust'', 50% of African deaths occurred in Africa as a result of wars between native kingdoms, which produced the majority of slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; This includes not only those who died in battles but also those who died as a result of forced marches from inland areas to slave ports on the various coasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;&gt;Gomez, Michael A. ''Exchanging Our Country Marks''. Chapel Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of enslaving enemy combatants and their villages was widespread throughout Western and West Central Africa, although wars were rarely started to procure slaves. The slave trade was largely a by-product of tribal and state [[war]]fare as a way of removing potential dissidents after victory or financing future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, John. ''Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400–1800'', Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some African groups proved particularly adept and brutal at the practice of enslaving, such as [[Bono state|Bono State]], [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], [[Benin]], [[Igala people|Igala]], [[Kaabu]], [[Asanteman]], [[Dahomey]], the [[Aro Confederacy]] and the [[Imbangala]] war bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Derek R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Om12BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |title=The Politics of Heritage in Africa|last2=Gavua|first2=Kodzo|last3=Rassool|first3=Ciraj|date=2015-03-02|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09485-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stride, G.

In letters written by the [[Manikongo]], [[Afonso I of Kongo|Nzinga Mbemba Afonso]], to the King [[João III of Portugal]], he writes that Portuguese merchandise flowing in is what is fueling the trade in Africans. He requests the King of Portugal to stop sending merchandise but should only send missionaries. In one of his letters he writes:

{{quote|Each day the traders are kidnapping our people—children of this country, sons of our nobles and vassals, even people of our own family. This corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated. We need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise, unless it is wine and flour for Mass. It is our wish that this Kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves ...

Many of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains. To satisfy this inordinate appetite, they seize many of our black free subjects ... They sell them. After having taken these prisoners [to the coast] secretly or at night ... As soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam Hochschild 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa|first=Adam|last=Hochschild |author-link=Adam Hochschild|isbn=0-618-00190-5|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|title-link=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], slavery had already existed in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. [[Afonso I of Kongo]] believed that the slave trade should be subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote to King João III in 1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~winthrop/Thornton.html Winthrop, reading by John Thornton, &quot;African Political Ethics and the Slave Trade&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316075617/http://www.millersville.edu/~winthrop/Thornton.html |date=March 16, 2010 }}, Millersville College.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of [[Dahomey]] sold [[POW|war captives]] into transatlantic slavery; they would otherwise have been killed in a ceremony known as the [[The annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]]. As one of West Africa's principal slave states, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museeouidah.org/Theme-Dahomey.htm Museum Theme: The Kingdom of Dahomey], Musee Ouidah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-149772/Dahomey &quot;Dahomey (historical kingdom, Africa)&quot;], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalcall.com/national/slave_trade10-08-2002.htm &quot;Benin seeks forgiveness for role in slave trade&quot;], ''Final Call'', 8 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Bambara Empire]] to the east, the [[Khasso]] kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the [[Europe]]an settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the [[France|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.histoire-afrique.org/article76.html?artsuite=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201193105/http://www.histoire-afrique.org/article76.html?artsuite=5|url-status=dead|title=Le Mali précolonial.|archive-date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benin Empire|Benin]] grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the &quot;Slave Coast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter7.shtml ''The Story of Africa''], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Gezo of [[Dahomey]] said in the 1840s:

{{quote|The slave trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth ... the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Editor's Shanty |magazine=The Anglo-American Magazine |date=July–December 1854 |volume=V |page=94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDQiAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA94 |access-date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the Bill that abolished the trading of slaves. The King of Bonny (now in [[Nigeria]]) was horrified at the conclusion of the practice:

{{quote|We think this trade must go on. That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml African Slave Owners], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Port factories===
After being marched to the coast for sale, enslaved people were held in large forts called factories. The amount of time in factories varied, but [[Milton Meltzer]] states in ''Slavery: A World History'' that around 4.5% of deaths attributed to the transatlantic slave trade occurred during this phase.&lt;ref name = dup2/&gt; In other words, over 820,000 people are believed to have died in African ports such as [[Benguela]], [[Elmina]], and [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]], reducing the number of those shipped to 17.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=dup2&gt;Meltzer, Milton. ''Slavery: A World History''. Da Capo Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic shipment===
[[File:A Liverpool Slave Ship by William Jackson.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''A Liverpool Slave Ship'' by William Jackson. [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]]]]
After being captured and held in the factories, slaves entered the infamous [[Middle Passage]]. Meltzer's research puts this phase of the slave trade's overall mortality at 12.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;dup2&quot; /&gt; Their deaths were the result of brutal treatment and poor care from the time of their capture and throughout their voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolfe|first1=Brendan|title=Slave Ships and the Middle Passage|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Slave_Ships_and_the_Middle_Passage|website=encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2.2&amp;nbsp;million Africans died during these voyages, where they were packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time. Measures were taken to stem the onboard mortality rate, such as enforced &quot;dancing&quot; (as exercise) above deck and the practice of force-feeding enslaved persons who tried to starve themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot; /&gt; The conditions on board also resulted in the spread of fatal diseases. Other fatalities were suicides, slaves who escaped by jumping overboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot; /&gt; The slave traders would try to fit anywhere from 350 to 600 slaves on one ship. Before the African slave trade was completely banned by participating nations in 1853, 15.3&amp;nbsp;million enslaved people had arrived in the Americas.

Raymond L. Cohn, an economics professor whose research has focused on [[economic history]] and [[international migration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ilstu.edu/vitas/rlcohn.html|title=Raymond L. Cohn.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622201438/http://www.econ.ilstu.edu/vitas/rlcohn.html|archive-date=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; has researched the [[mortality rate]]s among Africans during the voyages of the Atlantic slave trade. He found that mortality rates decreased over the history of the slave trade, primarily because the length of time necessary for the voyage was declining. &quot;In the eighteenth century many slave voyages took at least 2½ months. In the nineteenth century, 2 months appears to have been the maximum length of the voyage, and many voyages were far shorter. Fewer slaves died in the Middle Passage over time mainly because the passage was shorter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Raymond L. &quot;Deaths of Slaves in the Middle Passage&quot;, ''Journal of Economic History'', September 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the vast profits of slavery, the ordinary sailors on [[slave ship]]s were badly paid and subject to harsh discipline. Mortality of around 20%, a number similar and sometimes greater than those of the slaves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282 |title=The Atlantic slave trade: a census |last=Curtin |first=Philip D. |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1969 |isbn=0299054004 |location=Madison, WI |pages=[https://archive.org/details/atlanticslavetra0000curt/page/282 282–286]|oclc=46413}}&lt;/ref&gt; was expected in a ship's crew during the course of a voyage; this was due to disease, flogging, overwork, or slave uprisings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards(Captain.)2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernard Edwards|author2=Bernard Edwards (Captain.)|title=Royal Navy Versus the Slave Traders: Enforcing Abolition at Sea 1808–1898|year=2007|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Books|isbn=978-1-84415-633-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disease ([[malaria]] or [[yellow fever]]) was the most common cause of death among sailors. A high crew mortality rate on the return voyage was in the captain's interests as it reduced the number of sailors who had to be paid on reaching the home port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bury the Chains: Prophets, Slaves, and Rebels in the First Human Rights Crusade |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |date=2005 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0618104690 |page=[https://archive.org/details/burychainsprophe00hoch/page/94 94] |url=https://archive.org/details/burychainsprophe00hoch/page/94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slave trade was hated by many sailors, and those who joined the crews of slave ships often did so through coercion or because they could find no other employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rediker2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Rediker|title=The Slave Ship: A Human History|date=4 October 2007|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4406-2084-3|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasoning camps===
Meltzer also states that 33% of Africans would have died in the first year at the [[Seasoning (slave)|seasoning camps]] found throughout the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;dup2&quot; /&gt; [[Jamaica]] held one of the most notorious of these camps.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Captives who could not be sold were inevitably destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FreedmensInquiry&quot; /&gt;  Around 5 million Africans died in these camps, reducing the number of survivors to about 10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;dup2&quot; /&gt;

== Diseases ==
Many diseases, each capable of killing a large minority or even a majority of a new human population, arrived in the Americas after 1492. They include [[smallpox]], [[malaria]], [[bubonic plague]], [[typhus]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]], and [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epidemics and enslavement : biological catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492–1715|last=Paul.|first=Kelton|date=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803215573|location=Lincoln|oclc=182560175}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Atlantic slave trade following the discovery of the [[New World]], diseases such as these are recorded as causing mass mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epidemics in the modern world|last=P.|first=Krieg, Joann|date=1992|publisher=Twayne Publishers|isbn=0805788522|location=New York|oclc=25710386|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/epidemicsinmoder0000krie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary history may also have played a role in resisting the diseases of the slave trade. Compared to African and Europeans, New World populations did not have a history of exposure to diseases such as malaria, and therefore, no genetic resistance had been produced as a result of adaptation through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Disease Makes History: Epidemics and Great Historical Turning Points|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|last2=Panosian|first2=Claire|author-link2=Claire Panosian |publisher=Helsinki University Press|year=2006|isbn=9515706408|editor-last=Hämäläinen|editor-first=Pekka|location=Helsinki|pages=18–19, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels and extent of immunity varies from disease to disease. For smallpox and measles for example, those who survive are equipped with the immunity to combat the disease for the rest of their life in that they cannot contract the disease again. There are also diseases, such as [[malaria]], which do not confer effective lasting immunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

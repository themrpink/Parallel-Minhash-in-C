[[Image:ChessSet.jpg|thumbnail|250px|alt=Photo shows the six types of chess pieces in the Staunton style.|[[Staunton chess set|Staunton]] style chess pieces. ''Left to right:'' king, rook, queen, pawn, knight, bishop]]

The '''rules of chess''' (also known as the '''laws of chess''') are rules governing the play of the game of [[chess]]. While the exact [[origins of chess]] are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by [[FIDE]] (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for [[fast chess]], [[correspondence chess]], [[online chess]], and [[Chess960]].

Chess is a two-player [[board game]] using a [[chessboard]] and sixteen [[chess piece|pieces]] of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to [[checkmate]] (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's [[King (chess)|king]]. Games do not necessarily end in checkmate; players often [[#Resigning|resign]] if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in several ways.

Besides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, [[time control]], conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using [[chess notation]]. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.

Chess is played on a [[chessboard]], a square board divided into 64 squares (eight-by-eight) of alternating color, which is similar to that used in [[draughts]] (checkers) {{harvcol|FIDE|2008}}. No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called &quot;light&quot; or &quot;white&quot;, and the darker-colored squares are called &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;black&quot;. Sixteen &quot;white&quot; and sixteen &quot;black&quot; pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ''{{chessgloss|rank|ranks}}'' and vertical rows are called ''{{chessgloss|file|files}}''.

Each player controls sixteen pieces:

{{clear left}}
At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged as shown in the diagram: for each side one [[King (chess)|king]], one [[Queen (chess)|queen]], two [[Rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]], two [[Knight (chess)|knights]], and eight [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]]. The pieces are placed, one on a square, as follows:
* The rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.
* The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.
* The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.
* The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.
* The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.
* The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.
Popular mnemonics used to remember the setup are &quot;queen on her own color&quot; and &quot;white on right&quot;. The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player's right is white {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=16–17}}.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Chess players in park, kiev.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Photo shows two men playing chess while two more look on.|A game in a public park in [[Kyiv]], using a [[chess clock]]]]
The player controlling the white pieces is named &quot;White&quot;; the player controlling the black pieces is named &quot;Black&quot;. White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is [[zugzwang|detrimental]]. Play continues until a king is [[checkmate]]d, a player [[#Resigning|resigns]], or a [[draw (chess)|draw]] is declared, as explained below. In addition, if the game is being played under a [[time control]] players who exceed their [[#Time control|time limit]] lose the game.

The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system tournament]] or [[round-robin tournament]]) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.

{{col-end}}
Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when {{chessgloss|capture|capturing}} an opponent's piece.

Except for any move of the knight and [[#Castling|castling]], pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is ''captured'' (or ''taken'') when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square (''[[en passant]]'' is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.&lt;ref&gt;When [[promotion (chess)|promoting]] a pawn, a piece previously captured and removed from the board is often used as the &quot;new&quot; promoted piece. The new piece is nevertheless regarded as distinct from the original captured piece; the physical piece is used simply for convenience. Moreover, the player's choice for promotion is not restricted to pieces that were previously captured.&lt;/ref&gt; The king can be put in [[check (chess)|check]] but cannot be captured (see below).
* The [[King (chess)|king]] moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as ''[[#Castling|castling]]'' is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
* A [[Rook (chess)|rook]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.
* A [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.
* The [[Queen (chess)|queen]] moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* A [[Knight (chess)|knight]] moves to the nearest square not on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, {{chessgloss|file}}, or {{chessgloss|diagonal}}. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an &quot;L&quot; pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.
* [[Pawn (chess)|Pawns]] have the most complex rules of movement:
:* A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving ''two'' squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
:* Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).
: The pawn is also involved in the two special moves [[#En passant|''en passant'']] and [[#Pawn promotion|promotion]] {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=17–19}}.{{clear}}

{{col-end}}
Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the same time, because ''&quot;Each move must be played with one hand only.&quot;''{{refn|Article 4.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=FIDE Laws of Chess taking effect from 1 January 2018|url=https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018|access-date=12 July 2020|website=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:{{refn|Article 3.8.2 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
* The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
* There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
* The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);
* The castling must be {{chessgloss|kingside}} or {{chessgloss|queenside}} as shown in the diagram.{{clear}}

====''En passant''====
{{Main|En passant}}
[[File:Ajedrez captura al paso del peon.png|right|275px|alt=Three images showing ''en passant''. First, a white pawn moves from the a2-square to a4; then, the black pawn moves from b4 to a3; finally, the white pawn on a4 is removed|''en passant'']]
When a pawn advances two squares from its original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same {{chessgloss|rank}}, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, as if it had moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it ''en passant'', moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.
{{clear}}

====Pawn promotion====
{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}

If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then ''promoted'' (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player must call the {{chessgloss|arbiter}} to provide the piece.{{refn|Article 6.11.2 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ArbitersManual&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=ARBITERS'S MANUAL 2020|url=https://arbiters.fide.com/images/stories/downloads/2020/ARB_Manual_2020.pdf|access-date=12 July 2020|website=FIDE Arbiter's Commission|page=13|quote=When a player places an inverted (upside-down) Rook on the promotion square and continues the game, the piece is considered as a Rook, even if he names it as a &quot;Queen&quot; or any other piece.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Check===
{{Main|Check (chess)}}
{{Chess diagram

 |
 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

 |Black's king is in check. It can get out of check by moving to an unattacked square. Black can also parry the check by moving the bishop to e5 or the knight to f4 to block the check, or by capturing the white bishop with the knight. {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;{{harvcol|Harkness|1967}}&lt;/small&gt;}}
}}
A king is ''in check'' when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is [[pin (chess)|pinned]] against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.

It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:
* ''Move'' the king to a square where it is not in check.
* ''Capture'' the checking piece (possibly with the king).
* ''Block'' the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}, {{harvcol|Polgar|Truong|2005|pp=32,103}}, {{harvcol|Burgess|2009|p=550}}.

If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is [[checkmate]]d and the game is over (see the next section).

In informal games, it is customary to announce &quot;check&quot; when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.

===End of the game===

==== Checkmate ====

If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, then the king is said to be ''[[checkmate]]d'', the game ends, and that player loses {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=20–21}}. Unlike other pieces, capturing the opponent's king is not allowed.{{refn|Article 1.4.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}{{refn|Capturing the king is valid under USCF rules: Article 7d. (for defining a win): &quot;Who, after an illegal move is completed by the opponent, takes the king (if the king is in check)&quot; in USCF Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;UscfLawsOfChess&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=US_Chess_Rule_Book- Online_Only_Edition_v7.1-1.2.11-7.19.19.pdf|url=http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/chessrules/US_Chess_Rule_Book-%20Online_Only_Edition_v7.1-1.2.11-7.19.19.pdf|access-date=17 July 2020|website=The United States Chess Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The diagram shows an example checkmate position. The white king is threatened by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.
{{clear}}

====Resigning====
Either player may ''resign'' at any time, conceding the game to their opponent. A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on their {{chessgloss|score sheet}} in any of three ways: (1) by writing &quot;resigns&quot;, (2) by circling the result of the game, or (3) by writing &quot;1–0&quot; if Black resigns or &quot;0–1&quot; if White resigns {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=21}}. Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it is not frequently used and should be distinguished from accidentally knocking the king over.{{fact|date=October 2020}} Stopping both clocks is not an indication of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a handshake is not necessarily a resignation either, since one player could think they are agreeing to a draw {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.
{{clear}}

==== Dead position ====
{{Chess diagram

}}
A {{chessgloss|dead position}} is defined as a position where neither player can win the game by any sequence of legal moves.{{refn|Article 5.2.2 &quot;The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent's king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to end in a 'dead position'.&quot; in the FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
* Any positions with the following pieces only are known as dead positions. The USCF rules speak of {{chessgloss|insufficient_material|insufficient material}} for these positions:{{refn|Article &quot;14D. Insufficient material to continue&quot; in USCF Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;UscfLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
** king against king;
** king against king and bishop;
** king against king and knight;
** king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on squares of the same color (see [[Checkmate#King_and_two_bishops|King and two bishops]]).
*  However, ''insufficient material'' is not the only condition for a dead position. There are positions where the pieces on the board would be sufficient to mate if arranged otherwise. See diagram &quot;Example of a dead position&quot;.

==== Draws ====

|Black to move is in stalemate, since his king has no legal move, and is not in check. The game is drawn.
}}

The game ends in a [[draw (chess)|draw]] if any of these conditions occur:
* The game is automatically a draw if the player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This situation is called a [[stalemate]]. An example of such a position is shown in the adjacent diagram.
* The game is immediately drawn for a [[#dead_position|dead position]].
* Both players [[Draw by agreement|agree to a draw]] after one of the players makes such an offer.
* The player having the move may claim a draw by declaring that one of the following conditions exists, or by declaring an intention to make a move which will bring about one of these conditions. If the claim is proven true, the game is drawn:{{refn|Articles 9.2.1 and 9.3 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
** The same board position has occurred three times with the same player to move and all pieces having the same rights to move, including the right to [[castling|castle]] or capture ''[[en passant]]'' (see [[Threefold repetition|threefold repetition rule]]).
** There has been no {{chessgloss|capture}} or pawn move in the last fifty moves by each player, if the last move was not a checkmate (see [[fifty-move rule]]).
* The game ends immediately with a draw by the intervention of the arbiter, without a draw request necessary:
** When the same board position has occurred five times (see [[Threefold_repetition#Fivefold_repetition_rule|fivefold repetition rule]]).
** When the moves without capture or pawn move extend up to seventy-five (see [[Fifty-move_rule#Seventy-five-move_rule|seventy-five-move rule]]).

At one time, if a player was able to check the opposing king continually ([[perpetual check]]) and the player indicated their intention to do so, the game was drawn. This rule is no longer in effect; however, players will usually agree to a draw in such a situation, since either the rule on threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule will eventually be applicable {{harvcol|Staunton|1847|pp=21–22}}, {{Harvcol|Reinfeld|1954|p=175}}.

A game played under [[time control]] will end as a loss for a player who uses up all of their allotted time, which is called {{chessgloss|Flag-fall}}, unless the opponent cannot possibly checkmate him (see [[#Timing|Timing]]). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or they may have to make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.

==Competition rules==
The following rules are the rules used for &quot;{{chessgloss|over the board}}&quot; (OTB) games. They are defined by the FIDE Laws of Chess.&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt; The FIDE Laws of Chess define the rules for Standard chess, [[Fast_chess#Rapid|Rapid chess]], [[Fast_chess#Blitz|Blitz chess]] and guidelines for [[Fischer_random_chess|Chess960]]. Some rules are specifically adapted for disabled players. As the rules cover OTB play, they cannot be directly applied to computer chess or online chess, played on a computer device. The rules for [[correspondence chess]] are defined by the [[International_Correspondence_Chess_Federation|ICCF]].

===Moving the pieces===
The movement of pieces is to be done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the {{chessgloss|illegal move|move is illegal}}.{{refn|Article 4.7 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} When castling, the player should first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19–20}}.

In the case of a [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]], if the player releases the pawn on the eighth rank, the player must promote the pawn. After the pawn has moved, the player may touch any piece not on the board and the promotion is not finalized until the new piece is released on the promotion square {{harvcol|Just|2014|}}.

=== Touch-move rule ===
{{Main|Touch-move rule}}
In serious play, if a player having the move touches a piece as if having the intention of moving it, then the player must move it if it can be legally moved. So long as the hand has not left the piece on a new square, any legal move can be made with the piece. If a player touches one of the opponent's pieces then that piece must be {{chessgloss|capture|captured}} if there is a legal move that does so. If none of the touched pieces can be moved or captured there is no penalty {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19–20}}.

When [[castling]], the king must be the first piece touched.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United States Chess Federation]] has a variation that tournament directors can use. If a player ''intending'' to castle touches the rook first, there is no penalty. However, if castling is illegal, the touch-move rule applies to the rook. This variation does not have to be announced in pre-tournament publicity but should be announced at the start of the tournament. {{cite web|url=http://www.uschess.org/docs/gov/reports/RulebookChanges.pdf|title=Rulebook Changes}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player touches the king and a rook, the player must castle with that rook if it is legal to do so.{{refn|Article 4.4.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} If the player completes a two-square king move without touching a rook, the player must move the correct rook accordingly if castling in that direction is legal. If a player starts to castle illegally, another legal king move must be made if possible, including castling with the other rook {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|p=20}}.

If a player moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be substituted for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the [[Promotion (chess)|promoted]] piece is released on that square.

If a player wishes to touch a piece with the intention of adjusting its position on a square, the player must first alert the opponent of this intention by saying ''J'adoube'' or &quot;I adjust&quot;. Once the game has started, only the player with the move may touch the pieces on the board {{harvcol|Schiller|2003|pp=19–20}}.

=== Timing ===
[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=Photo shows a digital chess clock. There are two clocks, one on each side and a button on top of each stops that clock and starts the other|Digital chess clock]]
Tournament games are played under time constraints, called [[time control]]s, using a [[chess clock]]. Players must make their moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls applied. For standard chess, different periods can be defined with different fixed times (e.g. first 40 moves in 100 minutes, next 20 moves in 50 minutes, remaining moves in 15 minutes). For rapid and blitz chess, only one period can be defined where all moves must be performed. Additionally, an [[Time_control#Increment_and_delay_methods|increment or delay]] per move may be defined.{{refn|Comment to Article 6.3.2 in Arbiter's Manual&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
* When a player runs out of time, this event is called {{chessgloss|Flag fall|flag fall}}. A flag fall has no consequences unless stated as observed by the arbiter, in which case the arbiter must intervene,{{refn|For standard chess by Article 6.8, for rapid chess by Article 6.8 if using competition rules, otherwise A.4.5, for blitz chess by Article 6.8 if using competition rules, otherwise rapid chess rules are used so by A.4.5 in FIDE Laws of Chess.&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} or claimed by a player.{{refn|Article 6.8 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
* When no flag fall is stated, and one of the following events occur, the result of the game still holds. It is of no relevance if the player runs out of time afterwards, or has already run out of time, but this was not stated: 
** If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins.{{refn|Article 6.2.1.1 concerning mate in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
** If a move results in a [[stalemate]], {{chessgloss|dead position}}, [[Threefold_repetition#Fivefold_repetition_rule|fivefold repetition]] or the [[Fifty-move_rule#Seventy-five-move_rule|seventy-five-move]] rule applies, the game is over and the game is drawn.{{refn|Article 6.2.1.1 concerning draw in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}
* If a player claims flag fall and is himself not out of time, then he wins the game if he still theoretically could checkmate the opponent; otherwise the game is a draw.{{refn|Article 6.9 in Fide Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}

The [[United States Chess Federation]] (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines &quot;insufficient material to win on time&quot;, that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See [[Monika Soćko#Rules appeal in 2008|Monika Soćko rules appeal in 2008]] and [[Women's World Chess Championship 2008]] for a famous instance of this rule.)
* With mechanical clocks only, flag fall for both players can occur. With digital clocks, the clock indicates which flag fell first, and this information is valid.{{refn|Comment to Article 6.4 &quot;Where electronic clocks are used and both clocks show 0.00, the Arbiter can usually
establish which flag fell first, with the help of the ‘-‘ or any other flag indication.&quot; in Arbiter's manual&lt;ref name=&quot;ArbitersManual&quot;/&gt;}}
* If a flag fall is stated, and as can happen with mechanical clocks only, the flag fall happened for both players, then:{{refn|Article III.3.1 in FIDE Laws of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}}{{refn|Article 5.4.2, &quot;In approved clocks, when both flags fall down must be seen which flag fell first.&quot;, in &quot;FIDE Standards of Chess Equipment, venue for FIDE Tournaments, rate of play and tie-break regulations&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FideTournamentStandards&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Standards of Chess Equipment, venue for FIDE Tournaments, rate of play and tie-break regulations|url=https://handbook.fide.com/files/handbook/C02Standards.pdf|access-date=16 July 2020|website=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
** If it can be established which player ran out of time first, the rules apply for flag fall for one player only.
** Otherwise, the result is a draw, unless this is a standard chess game which is not in the last period, here the play will be resumed.

In the last period of a standard chess game or rapid games, if played without increment, a special set of rules applies regarding the clock, referenced as &quot;Quickplay Finishes&quot;.{{refn|&quot;III. Games without increment including Quickplay Finishes&quot; under Guidelines in Fide Laws Of Chess&lt;ref name=&quot;FideLawsOfChess&quot;/&gt;}} These rules allow a player with under two minutes time to request an increment introduced, or request a draw based on claiming no progress or no effort, to be ruled by the arbiter. These rules have been relevant when playing with mechanical clocks, which do not allow setting an increment and are today with digital clocks of second importance only, as playing with increment is recommended.{{refn|Guideline III.5.2 comment &quot;A time control with an increment is a much better way of concluding a game.&quot; in Arbiter's Manual&lt;ref name=&quot;ArbitersManual&quot;/&gt;}}

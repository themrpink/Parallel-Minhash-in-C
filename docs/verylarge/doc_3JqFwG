Two months after the end of the war, Queen Mary's youngest son, John, died at the age of thirteen. She described her shock and sorrow in her diary and letters, extracts of which were published after her death: &quot;our poor darling little Johnnie had passed away suddenly&amp;nbsp;... The first break in the family circle is hard to bear but people have been so kind &amp; sympathetic &amp; this has helped us [the King and me] much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her staunch support of her husband continued during the later half of his reign. She advised him on speeches and used her extensive knowledge of history and royalty to advise him on matters affecting his position. He appreciated her discretion, intelligence, and judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt; She maintained an air of self-assured calm throughout all her public engagements in the years after the war, a period marked by civil unrest over social conditions, [[Irish War of Independence|Irish independence]], and [[Indian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s, George V became increasingly ill with lung problems, exacerbated by his heavy smoking. Queen Mary paid particular attention to his care. During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir [[Farquhar Buzzard]], was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, &quot;The Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gore, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their [[silver jubilee]], with celebrations taking place throughout the [[British Empire]]. In his jubilee speech, George paid public tribute to his wife, having told his speechwriter, &quot;Put that paragraph at the very end. I cannot trust myself to speak of the Queen when I think of all I owe her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times (London)'', Wednesday, 25 March 1953 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen mother (1936–1952) ==
George V died on 20 January 1936, after his physician, [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson of Penn]], gave him an injection of [[morphine]] and [[cocaine]] that may have hastened his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Watson|title=The Death of George V|journal=History Today|year=1986|volume=36|pages=21–30|pmid=11645856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Mary's eldest son ascended the throne as Edward VIII. She was now the [[queen mother]], though she did not use that style, and was instead known as ''Her Majesty Queen Mary''.

Within the year, Edward caused a [[constitutional crisis]] by announcing his desire to marry his twice-divorced American mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]]. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against the teaching of the [[Church of England|Anglican church]], and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], as well as the [[British Dominions|Dominion]] governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]]. 

Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Airlie, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court,&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved [[Prince Albert, Duke of York]], who had a stammer. Albert ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British [[dowager queen]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;According to custom, crowned heads do not attend coronations of other kings and queens. Pope-Hennessy, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 401 and Pope-Hennessy, p. 575&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen Mary with Princess Elizabeth and Margaret.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Queen Mary with her granddaughters, Princesses [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] (front) and [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]], May 1939|alt=Elderly Mary and the two girls in formal dress]]

Mary took an interest in the upbringing of her granddaughters, Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], and took them on various excursions in London, to art galleries and museums. (The princesses' own parents thought it unnecessary for them to be taxed with any demanding educational regime.)&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], George VI wished his mother to be evacuated from London. Although she was reluctant, she decided to live at [[Badminton House]], [[Gloucestershire]], with her niece, [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort]], the daughter of her brother [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Adolphus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Her personal belongings were transported from London in seventy pieces of luggage. Her household, which comprised fifty-five servants, occupied most of the house, except for the Duke and Duchess's private suites, until after the war. The only people to complain about the arrangements were the royal servants, who found the house too small,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Mosley|editor-first=Charles|title=Burke's Peerage &amp; Gentry, 107th edition|year=2003|pages=vol. I p. 308|chapter=Duke of Beaufort, 'Seat' section|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Queen Mary annoyed her niece by having the ancient ivy torn from the walls as she considered it unattractive and a hazard. From Badminton, in support of the war effort, she visited troops and factories and directed the gathering of scrap materials. She was known to offer lifts to soldiers she spotted on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, her youngest surviving son, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], was killed in an air crash while on active service. Mary finally returned to [[Marlborough House]] in June 1945, after the war in Europe had resulted in the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]].

Mary was an eager collector of objects and pictures with a royal connection.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; She paid above-market estimates when purchasing jewels from the estate of [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clarke|first=William|title=The Lost Fortune of the Tsars|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paid almost three times the estimate when buying the family's Cambridge Emeralds from Lady Kilmorey, the mistress of her late brother [[Prince Francis of Teck|Prince Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thomson, Mark|title=Document – A Right Royal Affair|publisher=BBC Radio 4|date= 29 August 2005}}&lt;br /&gt;See also [http://www.proni.gov.uk/introduction_kilmorey_d2638-2.pdf Kilmorey Papers (D/2638)] (pdf), [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the famous architect [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] created [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]] for her collection of miniature pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, pp. 531–534&lt;/ref&gt; She has sometimes been criticised for her aggressive acquisition of ''objets d'art'' for the [[Royal Collection]]. On several occasions, she would express to hosts, or others, that she admired something they had in their possession, in the expectation that the owner would be willing to donate it.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Her extensive knowledge of, and research into, the Royal Collection helped in identifying artefacts and artwork that had gone astray over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family had lent out many pieces over previous generations. Once she had identified unreturned items through old inventories, she would write to the holders, requesting that they be returned.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being an avid collector, Mary also commissioned many gifts of jewellery, including rings which she presented to her ladies-in-waiting on the occasion of their engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sjrood.weebly.com|title=S.

In 1952, King George VI died, the third of Queen Mary's children to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The death of a third child profoundly affected her. Mary remarked to [[Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein|Princess Marie Louise]]: &quot;I have lost three sons through death, but I have never been privileged to be there to say a last farewell to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Louise, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died on 24 March 1953 in her sleep at the age of 85, ten weeks before her granddaughter's [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/24/newsid_2785000/2785265.stm|title=1953: Queen Mary dies peacefully after illness|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary had let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed.

Year '''358''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLVIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Datianus and [[Neratius Cerealis|Cerealis]]''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1111 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 358 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

__NOTOC__
Year '''357''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCLVII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Wednesday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Constantius and Iulianus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1110 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 357 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''José de Sousa Saramago''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of St. James of the Sword|GColSE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ ðɨ ˈso(w).zɐ sɐɾɐˈmaɣu|lang}}; 16 November 1922 – 18 June 2010), was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer and recipient of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His works, some of which can be seen as [[Allegory|allegories]], commonly present [[Subversion|subversive]] perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the [[Theopoetics|theopoetic]] human factor.

==Novelist==
In 2003 [[Harold Bloom]] described Saramago as &quot;the most gifted novelist alive in the world today&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |date=2003 |title=Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds |location=New York |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0-446-52717-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/geniusmosaicof1000bloo_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 said he considers Saramago to be &quot;a permanent part of the [[Western canon]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Harold|last=Bloom|authorlink=Harold Bloom|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2036477_2036518,00.html|title=Fond Farewells|work=TIME|date=15 December 2010|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] praises &quot;the distinctive tone to his fiction because he narrates his novels as if he were someone both wise and ignorant.&quot;&lt;ref name=militant_magician/&gt; Bloom and Saramago met when Saramago presented Bloom with an honorary degree from the [[University of Coimbra]]; according to Bloom: &quot;A warm acquaintanceship ensued, marked by an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] disagreement concerning ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'', which continued in correspondence and at a later meeting in New York City&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Harold|last=Bloom|authorlink=Harold Bloom|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/02/23/grand-comedian-visits-bible/|title=The Grand Comedian Visits the Bible|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=23 February 2012|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two million copies of Saramago's books have been sold in Portugal alone and his work has been translated into 25 languages.&lt;ref name=eberstadt_dies/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt_defends_work/&gt; A proponent of [[Anarchist communism|libertarian communism]],&lt;ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns/&gt; Saramago criticized institutions such as the [[Catholic Church]], the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. An [[Atheism|atheist]], he defended love as an instrument to improve the human condition. In 1992, the [[Government of Portugal]] under Prime Minister [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]] ordered the removal of one of his works, ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'', from the [[Aristeion Prize]]'s shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive. Disheartened by this political [[censorship]] of his work,&lt;ref name=president_no-show/&gt; Saramago went into exile on the Spanish island of [[Lanzarote]], where he lived alongside his Spanish wife [[Pilar del Río]] until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name=unexpected_fantasist&gt;Quoted in: {{cite news|first=Fernanda|last=Eberstadt|authorlink=Fernanda Eberstadt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/magazine/26saramago-t.html|title=The Unexpected Fantasist|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 August 2007|accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap_dies/&gt;

Saramago was a founding member of the National Front for the Defense of Culture in Lisbon in 1992, and co-founder with [[Orhan Pamuk]], of the European Writers' Parliament (EWP).

Also, while there is no open standing per se, [[prerogative writ]]s like [[certiorari]],&lt;ref&gt;re Smith; Ex parte Rundle (1991) 6 [[Western Australian Reports|WAR]] 295, [[Supreme Court of Western Australia|Supreme Court]] (WA, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; [[writ of prohibition]], [[quo warranto]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac HCA&quot;/&gt; and [[habeas corpus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1329|2001|litigants=[[Ruddock v Vadarlis]] (Tampa case) |parallelcite=(2001) 110 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 491 |date=18 September 2001 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have a low burden in establishing standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;STANDING IN PUBLIC INTEREST CASES&quot;/&gt; &lt;br&gt; Australian courts also recognise [[amicus curiae]] (friend of the court),&lt;ref name=&quot;R.L.L Kelly 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|213|1988|litigants=US tobacco v Minister for Consumer Affairs |parallelcite=(1988) 20 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 520 |date=24 June 1988 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the various [[Attorneys General]]s have a presumed standing in [[administrative law]] cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;R.L.L Kelly 2009&quot;/&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada|Canadian]] [[administrative procedure law|administrative law]], whether an individual has standing to bring an application for judicial review, or an appeal from the decision of a tribunal, is governed by the language of the particular statute under which the application or the appeal is brought. Some statutes provide for a narrow right of standing while others provide for a broader right of standing.&lt;ref&gt;For example, under s. 18(1) the ''Federal Court Act'', an application for review may be made by &quot;anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which the relief is sought&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently a litigant wishes to bring a [[civil action]] for a [[declaratory judgment]] against a public body or official. This is considered an aspect of administrative law, sometimes with a constitutional dimension, as when the litigant seeks to have legislation declared unconstitutional.

===Public interest standing===
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] developed the concept of public interest standing in three constitutional cases commonly called &quot;the Standing trilogy&quot;: ''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]'', [1975] 1 S.C.R. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil]]'', [1976] 2 S.C.R. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Minister of Justice v. Borowski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minister of Justice v. Borowski]]'', [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy was summarized as follows in ''[[Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)]]'', [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It has been seen that when public interest standing is sought, consideration must be given to three aspects. First, is there a serious issue raised as to the invalidity of legislation in question? Second, has it been established that the plaintiff is directly affected by the legislation or if not does the plaintiff have a genuine interest in its validity? Third, is there another reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the court?&lt;ref&gt;http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992rcs1-236/1992rcs1-236.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Public-interest standing is also available in non-constitutional cases, as the Court found in ''Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance)'', [1986] 2 S.C.R. 607 [http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1986/1986rcs2-607/1986rcs2-607.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==International courts==
The [[Council of Europe]] created the first international court before which individuals have automatic ''locus standi''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rhona K. M., ''Textbook on International Human Rights''. 4th Edition.  2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nigeria==
Like in other Jurisdictions, the right to approach court is contained in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;section 6(6)B of Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended&lt;/ref&gt; The right to approach court has been interpreted in several cases, this has caused the right to be view differently in different cases. In recent times, there have been different approaches to locus standi. They are:

* Traditional approach 
* Liberal Approach

The first approach means that only the party who has suffered pecuniary damage or special damage can seek redress in the court of law.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Adesanya V. President (1981)Law Pavilion Electronic Law Report -44501&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of AIRTEL NETWORKS LTD. V. GEORGE&lt;ref&gt;(2015) 4 NIGERIAN WEEKLY LAW REPORT -NWLR- [1448] page 60&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that ″a party is said to have locus if he has shown sufficient interest in the action and that his civil rights and obligations have been or are in danger of being infringed″. Under this approach, a party can only seek redress provided he has proved to the satisfaction of the court that he has suffered sufficient damage over and above any other persons in the concern action.&lt;ref&gt;Jukok Int'l Ltd. V. Diamond Bank PLC (2016) NWLR [1507]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Only the Attorney General can seek redress in any case on public affairs except the party is authorised through fiat emanates from Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt; Fawehinmi V. President (2007)14 NWLR [1054] 275&lt;/ref&gt; On the other approach, it is a departure from the first approach. It can also be said to be an exception to the first approach. Liberal Approach means that locus standi will be granted to any person who challenge any unconstitutionality provided the person is being governed by the said constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Fawehinmi V. President (2007)14 NWLR [1054] 275&lt;/ref&gt; This expands the frontier of locus standi on Constitutional issue. His Lordship Aboki, Justice of Court of Appeal said &quot;the requirement of (strict) locus standi become unnecessary in Constitutional issues as it will merely impede Judicial function.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fawehinmi V. President (2007)14 NWLR [1054] 275&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, any person can also challenge infringement on fundamental human rights&lt;ref&gt;Fawehinmi V. Akilu no. 2(1989) NWLR [122]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this second approach, the locus standi is expanded to enable court adjudicate on certain matters in order to ensure that justice prevails.

==United Kingdom==
In British administrative law, the applicant needs to have a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates.&lt;ref&gt;Senior Courts Act 1981 s.31(3).&lt;/ref&gt; This sufficient interest requirement has been construed liberally by the courts. As [[Lord Diplock]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;''Inland Revenue Commissioners Appellants v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. Respondents'' [1982] A.C. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]t would&amp;nbsp;... be a grave danger to escape ''[[Lacuna (law)|lacuna]]'' in our system of public law if a pressure group&amp;nbsp;... or even a single public spirited taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of ''locus standi'' from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[English law of contract|law of contract]], the doctrine of [[privity]] meant that only those who were party to a contract could sue or be sued upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tweddle v Atkinson]]'', ''[[Dunlop v Selfridge]]'', ''[[Beswick v Beswick]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine was substantially amended by the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]]. which allows beneficiaries under a contract to enforce it.

Almost all criminal prosecutions are brought by the state via the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], so private prosecutions are rare. An exception was the case of [[Whitehouse v Lemon]] where [[Mary Whitehouse|Mrs Mary Whitehouse]], a self-appointed guardian of suburban morality, was permitted to bring a private prosecution for &quot;[[blasphemous libel]]&quot; against the publisher of ''[[Gay News]]'', [[Denis Lemon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.swarb.co.uk/c/hl/1979Whitehouse-GayNews.html ''Whitehouse v Lemon'' 2 WLR 281]&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of crime have standing to sue the perpetrator and they may claim [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority|criminal injuries compensation]] from the state. If the state fails properly to bring a case, the victim or his family may have standing to bring a private prosecution, as in the case of [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|Stephen Lawrence]].

==United States==
{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[United States law]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has stated, &quot;In essence the question of standing is whether the [[litigant]] is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Warth v. Seldin]]'', 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of requirements that a plaintiff must establish to have standing before a federal court. Some are based on the [[case or controversy]] requirement of the judicial power of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], [[Article III of the Constitution of the United States#Powers|§ 2, cl.1]]. As stated there, &quot;The Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases . . .[and] to Controversies . . .&quot; The requirement that a plaintiff have standing to sue is a limit on the role of the judiciary and the law of Article III standing is built on the idea of separation of powers.&lt;ref name=AllenvWright&gt;{{ussc|name=Allen v. Wright|volume=468|page=737|pin=752|year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts may exercise power only &quot;in the last resort, and as a necessity&quot;.&lt;ref name=AllenvWright/&gt;

The [[United States|American]] doctrine of standing is assumed as having begun with the case of ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]''.&lt;ref name=Frothingham&gt;{{ussc|name=Frothingham v. Mellon|volume=262|page=447|pin=|year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal standing truly rests its first prudential origins in ''[[Fairchild v. Hughes]]'', (1922) which was authored by Justice Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Fairchild v. Hughes|volume=258|page=126 |pin=|year=1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Fairchild'', a citizen sued the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to challenge the procedures by which the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] was ratified. Prior to it, the doctrine was that all persons had a right to pursue a private prosecution of a public right.&lt;ref&gt;''The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance'', by Steven L. Winter, 40 ''Stan. L. Rev.'' 1371, July, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the doctrine has been embedded in [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|judicial rules]] and some statutes.

In 2011, in ''[[Bond v. United States (2011)|Bond v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant charged with violating a federal statute does have standing to challenge the constitutionality of that statute under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bond v. United States|link=Bond v. United States (2011)|volume=564|page=211|pin=|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing requirements===
There are three standing requirements:

# '''Injury-in-fact:''' The plaintiff must have suffered or imminently will suffer injury—an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent (that is, neither conjectural nor hypothetical; not abstract).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Varma
|first1=Corey
|year=2016
|title=The Presumption of Injury: Giving Data Breach Victims 'A Leg To Stand On'
|journal=Journal of Information Technology &amp; Privacy Law 
|volume=32
|issue=4
|url=http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1794&amp;context=jitpl
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury can be either economic, non-economic, or both.
# '''Causation:''' There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, so that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party who is not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]''  (global warming caused by EPA's refusal to regulate [[carbon dioxide]] emissions satisfied element of causation for Massachusetts's alleged injury of loss of coastland).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Redressability:''' It must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable court decision will redress the injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lujan v 1992&quot;&gt;{{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|504|555|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prudential limitations===
Additionally, there are three major prudential (judicially created) standing principles. Congress can override these principles via statute:

# '''Prohibition of [[Third-party standing]]:''' A party may only assert his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; exceptions exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the [[next friend]] doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the [[qui tam]] provision of the Civil [[False Claims Act]].&lt;ref name=VermontANR&gt;{{ussc|name=Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens|volume=529|page=765|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Prohibition of generalized grievances:''' A plaintiff cannot sue if the injury is widely shared in an undifferentiated way with many people. For example, the general rule is that there is no federal taxpayer standing, as complaints about the spending of federal funds are too remote from the process of acquiring them. Such grievances are ordinarily more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.
# '''Zone of interest test:''' There are in fact two tests used by the United States Supreme Court for the zone of interest
## Zone of injury: The injury is the kind of injury that Congress expected might be addressed under the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Federal Election Commission v. Akins|volume=524|page=11|pin=|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
## Zone of interests: The party is arguably within the zone of interest protected by the statute or constitutional provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Allen v. Wright|volume=468|page=737|pin=|year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent development of the doctrine===
In 1984, the Supreme Court reviewed and further outlined the standing requirements in a major ruling concerning the meaning of the three standing requirements of injury, causation, and redressability.&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 752 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the suit, parents of black public school children alleged that the Internal Revenue Service was not enforcing standards and procedures that would deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;avw755&quot;&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 755 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court established a significant injury for one of the claims, it found the causation of the injury (the nexus between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injuries) to be too attenuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;avw755&quot; /&gt; &quot;The injury alleged was not fairly traceable to the Government conduct respondents challenge as unlawful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 757 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In another major standing case, ''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'', 504 U.S. 555 (1992), the Supreme Court elaborated on the redressability requirement for standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lujan v 1992&quot;/&gt; The case involved a challenge to a rule promulgated by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] interpreting §7 of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] (ESA). The rule rendered §7 of the ESA applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit, because no injury had been established.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 562.&lt;/ref&gt; The injury claimed by the plaintiffs was that damage would be caused to certain species of animals and that this in turn injures the plaintiffs by the reduced likelihood that the plaintiffs would see the species in the future. The court insisted though that the plaintiffs had to show how damage to the species would produce imminent injury to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 564.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the plaintiffs did not sustain this burden of proof. &quot;The 'injury in fact' test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 563.&lt;/ref&gt; The injury must be imminent and not hypothetical.

Beyond failing to show injury, the Court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the standing requirement of redressability.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 568.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court pointed out that the respondents chose to challenge a more generalized level of government action, &quot;the invalidation of which would affect all overseas projects&quot;. This programmatic approach has &quot;obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causation or redressability is concerned&quot;.

In a 2000 case, ''Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens'', 529 U.S. 765 (2000),&lt;ref name=VermontANR/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] endorsed the &quot;partial assignment&quot; approach to [[qui tam]] relator standing to sue under the [[False Claims Act]] — allowing private individuals to sue on behalf of the U.S. government for injuries suffered solely by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan D. Sturycz, ''The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation'', 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=1537749. For the general standing rule, see {{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|504|555|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxpayer standing===
The initial case that established the doctrine of standing, ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]'', was a taxpayer standing case.&lt;ref name=Frothingham/&gt;

Taxpayer standing is the concept that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file a [[lawsuit]] against the taxing body if that body allocates funds in a way that the [[taxpayer]] feels is improper. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has held that taxpayer standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the [[United States government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Flast v. Cohen|volume=392|page=83|pin=|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., ''[[United States v. Richardson]].''

In ''[[DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno|volume=547|page=332|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court extended this analysis to state governments as well.  However, the Supreme Court has also held that taxpayer standing is constitutionally sufficient to sue a [[municipal government]] in a [[United States federal court|federal court]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-3/section-2/clause-1/substantial-interest-standing&lt;/ref&gt;

States are also protected against lawsuits by their [[sovereign immunity]]. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless have their own rules limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state. Furthermore, states have the power to determine what will constitute standing for a litigant to be heard in a state court, and may deny access to the courts premised on taxpayer standing alone.

In [[Florida]], a taxpayer has standing to sue if the state government is acting unconstitutionally with respect to public funds, or if government action is causing some special injury to the taxpayer that is not shared by taxpayers in general. In [[Virginia]], the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] has more or less adopted a similar rule.  An individual taxpayer generally has standing to challenge an act of a city or county where they live, but does not have general standing to challenge state expenditures.

===Standing to challenge statutes===
With limited exceptions, a party cannot have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless he will be subjected to the provisions of that statute.  There are some exceptions, however; for example, courts will accept [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenges to a statute on overbreadth grounds, where a person who is only partially affected by a statute can challenge the parts that do not affect him on the grounds that laws that restrict speech have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on other people's right to free speech.

The only other way someone can have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute is if the existence of the statute would otherwise deprive him of a right or a privilege even if the statute itself would not apply to him. The Virginia Supreme Court made this point clear in the case of ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'' 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005). Martin and Ziherl were girlfriend and boyfriend and engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse when Martin discovered that Ziherl had infected her with [[herpes]], even though he knew he was infected and did not inform her of this. She sued him for damages, but because it was illegal (at the time the case was filed) to commit &quot;fornication&quot; (sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are not married), Ziherl argued that Martin could not sue him because joint tortfeasors - those involved in committing a crime - cannot sue each other over acts occurring as a result of a criminal act (''Zysk v. Zysk'', 404 S.E.2d 721 (Va. 1990)). Martin argued in rebuttal that because of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (finding that state's sodomy law unconstitutional), Virginia's anti-fornication law was also unconstitutional for the reasons cited in Lawrence. Martin argued, therefore, she could, in fact, sue Ziherl for damages.

Lower courts decided that because the Commonwealth's Attorney doesn't prosecute [[fornication]] cases and no one had been prosecuted for fornication anywhere in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose - the ability to sue Ziherl for damages - if the statute is upheld, she had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Lawrence'' has found that there is a privacy right in one's private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against fornication was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in ''Zysk'' was no longer applicable.

However, the only reason Martin had standing to challenge the statute was that she had something to lose if it stayed on the books.

=== Ballot measures ===
In ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that being the proponents of a ballot measure is not by itself enough to confer legal standing. In that case, [[Proposition 8]] had banned same-sex marriage in California, a ban that was ruled unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that the proponents of Proposition 8 has no standing in court since they failed to show that they were harmed by the decision.

===State law===
State law on standing differs substantially from federal law and varies considerably from state to state.

====California====
On  December 29, 2009,  the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] for the Sixth District ruled that California Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 cannot be read as imposing a federal-style standing doctrine on California's code pleading system of civil procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasmine&quot;&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jasmine Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court (Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.) |vol=180 |reporter=Cal. App. 4th |opinion=980 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2009 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1500032.html |accessdate=2018-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In California, the fundamental inquiry is ''always'' whether the plaintiff has sufficiently plead a cause of action,  not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive merits of the claim advanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasmine&quot; /&gt; The court acknowledged that the word &quot;standing&quot; is often sloppily used to refer to what is really ''[[jus tertii]]'', and held that ''jus tertii'' in state law is not the same thing as the federal standing doctrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasmine&quot; /&gt;

{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[Law of the United States|United States law]], '''ripeness''' refers to the readiness of a case for [[litigation]]; &quot;a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Texas v. United States]]'', {{ussc|523|296|1998}}, p. 300, (internal quotation marks omitted), quoting ''[[Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.]]'', {{ussc|473|568|1985}}, p. 581 (quoting 13A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3532, p. 112 (1984)).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a law of ambiguous quality has been enacted but never applied, a case challenging that law lacks the ripeness necessary for a decision.

The goal is to prevent premature adjudication; if a dispute is insufficiently developed, any potential injury or stake is too speculative to warrant judicial action. Ripeness issues most usually arise when a plaintiff seeks anticipatory relief, such as an [[injunction]]. 

The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] fashioned a two-part test for assessing ripeness challenges to [[Code of Federal Regulations|federal regulations]]. The case is often applied to constitutional challenges to federal and state statutes as well. The Court said in ''[[Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner]]'', {{ussc|387|136|1967}}:

::Without undertaking to survey the intricacies of the ripeness doctrine it is fair to say that its basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. The problem is best seen in a twofold aspect, requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner'', {{ussc|387|136|1967}}, pp. 148-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both ''Abbott Laboratories'' and its first companion case, ''[[Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner]]'', {{ussc|387|158|1967}}, the Court upheld pre-enforcement review of an administrative regulation. However, the Court denied such review in the second companion case because any harm from noncompliance with the FDA regulation at issue was too speculative in the Court's opinion to justify judicial review.

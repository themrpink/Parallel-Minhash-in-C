Chen Shou's treatment of the legitimacy issue was generally accepted through to the [[Northern Song]] dynasty. Despite maintaining that none of the three states truly held the Mandate of Heaven since they all failed to unify China, Song historian [[Sima Guang]] used Wei's era names and thus affirmed the legitimacy of Wei's succession to Han in his [[universal history]] ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2018|p=353}} Sima Guang explained that his choice was merely out of convenience, and he was &quot;not honouring one and treating another with contempt, nor making distinction between orthodox and intercalary positions.&quot;{{sfn|de Crespigny|2018|p=353}} Nonetheless, the influential [[Neo-Confucian]] moralist [[Zhu Xi]] criticized Sima Guang's choice, taking the position that Shu Han was the true successor to the Han dynasty since Liu Bei was related to the imperial Liu clan by blood, and thus used Shu's calendar in his rewrite of Sima Guang's work, the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian Gangmu]]''.{{sfn|Mansvelt Beck|1986|pp=374-375}} This position, first argued by [[Xi Zuochi]] in the fourth century,{{sfn|McLaren|2012|p=53 note 41}} found support in Zhu Xi's time since the Song dynasty found itself in a similar situation as Shu Han, as it was forced out of north China by the [[Jurchens]] in 1127 and became known as the [[Southern Song]].{{sfn|McLaren|2006|pp=295-296}} The revisionist private histories of the time emphasized &quot;[[Ren (Confucianism)|humane]] governence&quot; (仁政) as a mark of legitimate dynastic succession, and saw Liu Bei as an idealized Confucian monarch.{{sfn|McLaren|2006|p=302}} The pro-Shu bias then found its way into popular forms of entertainment such as ''[[pinghua (storytelling)|pinghua]]'' tales and ''[[zaju]]'' performances, and was eventually codified in the 14th century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.{{sfn|McLaren|2012|p=46}}

==Legacy in popular culture==
{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
{{further|List of media adaptations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}
Numerous people and affairs from the period later became Chinese legends. The most complete and influential example is the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', written by [[Luo Guanzhong]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. Possibly due to the popularity of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', the Three Kingdoms era is one of the most well-known non-modern Chinese eras in terms of iconic characters, deeds and exploits. This is reflected in the way that fictional accounts of the Three Kingdoms, mostly based on the novel, play a significant role in East Asian popular culture. Books, television dramas, films, cartoons, anime, games, and music on the topic are still regularly produced in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Craig J.

The '''Han dynasty''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|漢朝}}|p=Hàncháo}}) was the second [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]] (202 BC–220 AD), established by the rebel leader [[Liu Bang]] and ruled by the [[House of Liu]].  Preceded by the short-lived [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC) and a warring [[interregnum]] known as the [[Chu{{ndash}}Han contention]] (206–202 BC), it was briefly interrupted by the [[Xin dynasty]] (9–23 AD) established by the [[usurp]]ing [[regent]] [[Wang Mang]], and was separated into two periods — the '''[[#Western Han|Western Han]]''' (202 BC–9 AD) and the '''[[#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]]''' (25–220&amp;nbsp;AD), before being succeeded by the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220–280 AD).  Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a [[golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in Chinese history, and influenced the identity of the [[History of China|Chinese civilization]] ever since.{{sfnp|Zhou|2003|p=34}} To this day, China's [[Han Chinese|majority ethnic group]] refers to themselves as the &quot;[[Han Chinese]]&quot;, the [[Sinitic language]] is known as &quot;Han language&quot;, and the [[written Chinese]] is referred to as &quot;[[Chinese characters|Han characters]]&quot;.{{sfnp|Schaefer|2008|p=279}}

[[Emperor of China|The emperor]] was at the pinnacle of [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty|Han society]]. He presided over the [[Government of the Han dynasty|Han government]] but shared power with both [[Chinese nobility|the nobility]] and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]]. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]], and a number of [[Kings of the Han dynasty|semi-autonomous kingdoms]]. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]]. From the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;141–87 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored [[Confucianism]] in education and court politics, synthesized with the [[cosmology]] of later scholars such as [[Dong Zhongshu]]. This policy endured until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912 AD.

The Han dynasty saw an [[economy of the Han dynasty|age of economic prosperity]] and witnessed a significant growth of the [[History of Chinese currency#Imperial China|money economy]] first established during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1050–256 BC). [[Ancient Chinese coinage|The coinage]] issued by the central government [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To [[Army of the Han dynasty|finance its military campaigns]] and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|Science and technology during the Han period]] saw significant advances, including the process of [[papermaking]], the nautical steering ship [[rudder]], the use of [[negative number]]s in [[Chinese mathematics|mathematics]], the [[raised-relief map]], the [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]]-powered [[armillary sphere]] for [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], and a [[seismometer]] employing an [[inverted pendulum]] that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.

The [[Xiongnu]], a nomadic [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] confederation,{{sfnp|Bailey|1985|pp=25–26}} defeated the Han in 200&amp;nbsp;BC and forced the Han to submit as a ''de facto'' inferior and vassal partner for several decades, but continued their military raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu launched [[Han–Xiongnu War|several military campaigns]] against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as [[List of tributaries of China|Han tributaries]]. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty and control into the [[Tarim Basin]] of [[Central Asia]], divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the [[Silk Road]], which reached as far as the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]]. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic [[Xianbei]] confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|military expeditions in the south]], annexing [[Han–Nanyue War|Nanyue in 111 BC]] and [[Han campaigns against Dian|Dian in 109 BC]], and in the [[Korean Peninsula]] where the [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]] and [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang Commanderies]] were established in 108 BC. After 92 AD, the palace [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] increasingly involved themselves in court politics, engaging in violent power struggles between the various [[consort clan]]s of the empresses and [[empress dowager|empresses dowager]], causing the Han's ultimate downfall. Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large [[Daoist]] religious societies which instigated the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice|Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion]]. Following the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] (r.&amp;nbsp;168–189 AD), the palace eunuchs [[History of the Han dynasty|suffered wholesale massacre]] by [[Military history of China before 1911|military officers]], allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and [[End of the Han dynasty|divide the empire]]. When [[Cao Pi]], king of [[Cao Wei|Wei]], usurped the throne from [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]], the Han dynasty ceased to exist.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', after the collapse of the [[Qin dynasty]] the [[hegemon]] [[Xiang Yu]] appointed [[Liu Bang]] as prince of the small fief of [[Hanzhong]], named after its location on the [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han River]] (in modern southwest [[Shaanxi]]). Following Liu Bang's victory in the [[Chu–Han Contention]], the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief.{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|p=116}}

[[China]]'s first [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty]] was the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–207 BC). The Qin united the Chinese [[Warring States period|Warring States]] by conquest, but their regime became unstable after the death of the first emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=60–61}} Two former rebel leaders, [[Xiang Yu]] (d.&amp;nbsp;202 BC) of [[Kingdom of Chu|Chu]] and [[Liu Bang]] (d.&amp;nbsp;195 BC) of [[Hanzhong|Han]], engaged [[Chu-Han contention|in a war]] to decide who would become [[wikt:hegemony|hegemon]] of China, which had fissured into [[Eighteen Kingdoms|18 kingdoms]], each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang.{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|pp=116–122}} Although Xiang Yu proved to be an effective commander, Liu Bang defeated him at [[Battle of Gaixia]] (202 BC), in modern-day [[Anhui]]. Liu Bang assumed the title [[Emperor of China|&quot;emperor&quot;]] (''huangdi'') at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;202–195 BC).{{sfnp|Davis|2001|pp=44–46}} [[Chang'an]] (known today as Xi'an) was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|p=122}}

[[File:Han dynasty Kingdoms 195 BC.png|thumb|left|300px|Thirteen direct-controlled [[commandery (China)|commanderies]] including the capital region (Yellow) and ten semi-autonomous kingdoms of the early periods, 195 BC]]

At the beginning of the '''Western Han'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{zh|t={{linktext|西漢}}|s={{linktext|西汉}}|p=Xīhàn|first=t}}), also known as the '''Former Han'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{zh|t={{linktext|前漢}}|s={{linktext|前汉}}|p=Qiánhàn|first=t}}) dynasty, thirteen centrally controlled [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]]—including the capital region—existed in the western third of the empire, while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten [[Kings of the Han dynasty|semi-autonomous kingdoms]].{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|pp=122–125}} To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu, Emperor Gaozu [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] some of them as kings. 

By 196 BC, the Han court had replaced all but one of these kings (the exception being in [[Changsha Kingdom|Changsha]]) with royal [[Liu]] family members, since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned.{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|pp=122–125}} After several insurrections by Han kings—the largest being the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] in 154 BC—the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies.{{sfnp|Loewe|1986|pp=139–144}} Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff; this duty was assumed by the imperial court.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1980 106 chu 1972 76&quot;/&gt; Kings became nominal heads of their [[fief]]s and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bielenstein 1980 106 chu 1972 76&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}}

To the north of [[China proper]], the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] chieftain [[Modu Chanyu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;209–174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. By the end of his reign, he controlled [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia]], and the [[Tarim Basin]], subjugating over twenty states east of [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=175–189, 196–198}}; {{harvp|Torday|1997|pp=80–81}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=387–388}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade [[embargo]] against the group.{{sfnp|Torday|1997|pp=75–77}} 

In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now [[Shanxi]] province, where they [[Battle of Baideng|defeated the Han forces at Baideng]] in 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Torday|1997|pp=75–77}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=190–192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations, the ''[[heqin]]'' agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as [[silk]] clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yü|1967|pp=9–10}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=52}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=192–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the tribute and a negotiation between [[Laoshang Chanyu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;174–160 BC) and [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] (r.&amp;nbsp;180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, many of the [[Chanyu]]'s Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] for additional goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=388–389}}; {{harvp|Torday|1997|pp=77, 82–83}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=195–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a court conference assembled by [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the [[Consensus decision-making|majority consensus]] of the ministers was to retain the ''heqin'' agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Torday|1997|pp=83–84}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=389–390}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a [[Battle of Mayi|limited engagement at Mayi]] involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=389–391}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=211–214}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When this plot failed in 133 BC,{{sfnp|Torday|1997|pp=91–92}} Emperor Wu launched a series of [[Han–Xiongnu War|massive military invasions]] into Xiongnu territory. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the [[Battle of Mobei]], where the Han commanders [[Huo Qubing]] (d.&amp;nbsp;117 BC) and [[Wei Qing]] (d.&amp;nbsp;106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yü|1986|p=390}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=237–240}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Wu's reign, Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu leader [[Huhanye|Huhanye Chanyu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;58–31 BC) finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in 51 BC. His rival claimant to the throne, [[Zhizhi Chanyu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;56–36 BC), was killed by [[Chen Tang]] and Gan Yanshou (甘延壽/甘延寿) at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]], in modern [[Taraz]], [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|1986|pp=196–197, 211–213}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=395–398}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Han Expansion.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC]]

In 121 BC, Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the [[Hexi Corridor]] to [[Lop Nur]]. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-[[Qiang people|Qiang]] invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: [[Jiuquan]], [[Zhangyi]], [[Dunhuang]], and [[Wuwei, Gansu|Wuwei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chang|2007|pp=5–8}}; {{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=241–242}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|pp=34–35}} On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|pp=6, 15–16, 44–45}} The court also encouraged [[commoner]]s, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|pp=15–16, 33–35, 42–43}}

Even before Han's expansion into Central Asia, diplomat [[Zhang Qian]]'s travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]); he also gathered information on Shendu ([[Indus River]] valley of [[North India]]) and Anxi (the [[Parthian Empire]]). All of these countries eventually received Han embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=247–249}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|pp=54–55}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|p=407}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=69}}; {{harvp|Torday|1997|pp=104–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These connections marked the beginning of the [[Silk Road]] trade network that extended to the [[Roman Empire]], bringing [[History of silk|Han items like silk]] to Rome and [[Roman glass|Roman goods such as glasswares]] to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|An|2002|p=83}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From roughly 115 to 60 BC, Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis [[city-state]]s in the Tarim Basin. Han was eventually victorious and established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Di Cosmo|2002|pp=250–251}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=390–391, 409–411}}; {{harvp|Chang|2007|p=174}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1986|p=198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han also [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The [[Han–Nanyue War|naval conquest of Nanyue]] in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]]. [[Yunnan]] was brought into the Han realm with the [[Han campaigns against Dian|conquest]] of the [[Dian Kingdom]] in 109 BC, followed by parts of the [[Korean Peninsula]] with the [[Han conquest of Gojoseon]] and colonial establishments of [[Xuantu Commandery]] and [[Lelang Commandery]] in 108 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=83}}; {{harvp|Yü|1986|pp=448–453}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In China's first known nationwide [[census]] taken in 2&amp;nbsp;AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.{{sfnp|Nishijima|1986|pp=595–596}}

To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu [[Nationalization|nationalized]] several private industries. He created central government [[Monopoly|monopolies]] administered largely by [[Four occupations|former merchants]]. These monopolies included salt, [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron]], and [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|liquor]] production, as well as [[Ancient Chinese coinage|bronze-coin currency]]. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=1–17}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1986|pp=160–161}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=581–588}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=75}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=57}}; see also {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent [[Regent|regency]] of [[Huo Guang]] (d.&amp;nbsp;68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal [[Government budget|budget]] reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Loewe|1986|pp=162, 185–206}}; {{harvp|Paludan|1998|p=41}}; {{harvp|Wagner|2001|pp=16–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Zhengjun]] (71 BC–13 AD) was first empress, then [[empress dowager]], and finally [[grand empress dowager]] during the reigns of the Emperors [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Yuan]] (r.&amp;nbsp;49–33 BC), [[Emperor Cheng of Han|Cheng]] (r.&amp;nbsp;33–7 BC), and [[Emperor Ai of Han|Ai]] (r.&amp;nbsp;7–1 BC), respectively. During this time, a succession of her male relatives held the title of regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=225–226}}; {{harvp|Huang|1988|pp=46–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Ai, Wang Zhengjun's nephew [[Wang Mang]] (45 BC–23 AD) was appointed regent as Marshall of State on 16 August under [[Emperor Ping of Han|Emperor Ping]] (r. 1 BC–6 AD).{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=227–230}} 

When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD, [[Ruzi Ying]] (d. 25 AD) was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=227–230}} Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age.{{sfnp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=227–230}} Despite this promise, and against protest and revolts from the nobility, Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine [[Mandate of Heaven]] called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own: the [[Xin dynasty]] (9–23 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=23–24}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=230–231}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included [[History of slavery|outlawing slavery]], [[nationalization|nationalizing]] land to [[Well-field system|equally distribute]] between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hansen|2000|p=134}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=232–234}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=58}}; {{harvp|Lewis|2007|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the [[Yellow River]] had raised its water level and overwhelmed the [[Flood control|flood control works]]. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the [[Shandong Peninsula]], though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 135 de Crespigny 2007 196 bielenstein 1986 241 244&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Hansen|2000|p=135}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=196}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=241–244}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers, many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the [[Red Eyebrows Rebellions|Red Eyebrows]] to survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 2000 135 de Crespigny 2007 196 bielenstein 1986 241 244&quot;/&gt; Wang Mang's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups.

The [[Gengshi Emperor]] (r.&amp;nbsp;23–25 AD), a descendant of [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] (r.&amp;nbsp;157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch [[Liu Penzi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=197, 560}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=249–250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gengshi's distant cousin Liu Xiu, known posthumously as [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the [[Battle of Kunyang]] in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=558–560}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=251–254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Guangwu's rule the Han Empire was restored. Guangwu made [[Luoyang]] his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his officers [[Deng Yu]] and [[Feng Yi]] had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=251–254}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=196–198, 560}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=54–55, 269–270, 600–601}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=254–255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mang's reign is known as the Western Han ({{zh|t={{linktext|西漢}}|s={{linktext|西汉}}|p=Xīhàn|first=t}}) or Former Han ({{zh|t={{linktext|前漢}}|s={{linktext|前汉}}|p=Qiánhàn|first=t}}) (206 BC–9 AD). During this period the capital was at [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]). From the reign of Guangwu the capital was moved eastward to Luoyang. The era from his reign until [[End of the Han dynasty|the fall of Han]] is known as the Eastern Han or Later Han (25–220 AD).{{sfnp|Hinsch|2002|pp=24–25}}

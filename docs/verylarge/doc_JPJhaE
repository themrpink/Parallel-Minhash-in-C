=== Great Migration of 1843 ===
[[File:ColumbiaAmericasGreatHighway040.png|thumb|A wagon lashed to a raft for the last stage of the emigration.]]

In what was dubbed &quot;The Great Migration of 1843&quot; or the &quot;Wagon Train of 1843&quot;, an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |title = The Wagon Train of 1843: The Great Migration |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531061021/http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |archive-date = May 31, 2008 |access-date = December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1840_1850.htm Events in The West: 1840–1850] PBS. Retrieved December 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They were led initially by [[John Gantt]], a former U.S. Army Captain and fur trader who was contracted to guide the train to Fort Hall for $1 per person. The winter before, Marcus Whitman had made a brutal mid-winter trip from Oregon to St. Louis to appeal a decision by his mission backers to abandon several of the Oregon missions. He joined the wagon train at the Platte River for the return trip. When the pioneers were told at Fort Hall by agents from the Hudson's Bay Company that they should abandon their wagons there and use pack animals the rest of the way, Whitman disagreed and volunteered to lead the wagons to Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons. The biggest obstacle they faced was in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] of Oregon where they had to cut and clear a trail through heavy timber. The wagons were stopped at [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], Oregon, by the lack of a road around Mount Hood. The wagons had to be disassembled and floated down the treacherous Columbia River and the animals herded over the rough [[Lolo Pass (Oregon)|Lolo trail]] to get by Mt. Hood. Nearly all of the settlers in the 1843 wagon trains arrived in the Willamette Valley by early October. A passable wagon trail now existed from the Missouri River to The Dalles. Jesse Applegate's account of the emigration, &quot;[[A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]],&quot; has been described as &quot;the best bit of literature left to us by any participant in the [Oregon] pioneer movement...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reviews|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=34|number=4|year=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been republished several times from 1868 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[wikisource:en:Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843|Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]] |journal=The Oregon Historical Quarterly |year=1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but completely passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about {{convert|2000|mi|km}}.

=== Oregon Country ===
In 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley drafted the [[Organic Laws of Oregon]] organizing land claims within the Oregon Country. Married couples were granted at no cost (except for the requirement to work and improve the land) up to {{convert|640|acre|km2}} (a [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] or square mile), and unmarried settlers could claim {{convert|320|acre|km2}}. As the group was a provisional government with no authority, these claims were not valid under United States or British law, but they were eventually honored by the United States in the [[Donation Land Act]] of 1850. The Donation Land Act provided for married settlers to be granted {{convert|320|acre|km2}} and unmarried settlers {{convert|160|acre|km2}}. Following the expiration of the act in 1854 the land was no longer free but cost $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare) with a limit of {{convert|320|acre|km2}}—the same as most other unimproved government land.

=== Women on the Overland Trail ===
Consensus interpretations, as found in John Faragher's book, ''Women and Men on the Overland Trail'' (1979), held that men and women's power within marriage was uneven. This meant that women did not experience the trail as liberating, but instead only found harder work than they had handled back east. However, feminist scholarship, by historians such as Lillian Schlissel,&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Schlissel, &quot;Women's diaries on the western frontier.&quot; ''American Studies'' (1977): 87-100 [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2301/2260 online].&lt;/ref&gt; Sandra Myres,&lt;ref&gt;Sandra L. Myres, ed., '' Ho for California!: Women's Overland Diaries from the Huntington Library'' (Huntington Library Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and Glenda Riley,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 969452 |title = The Specter of a Savage: Rumors and Alarmism on the Overland Trail |journal = The Western Historical Quarterly |volume = 15 |issue = 4 |pages = 427–444 |last1 = Riley |first1 = Glenda |year = 1984 |doi = 10.2307/969452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests men and women did not view the West and western migration in the same way. Whereas men might deem the dangers of the trail acceptable if there was a strong economic reward at the end, women viewed those dangers as threatening to the stability and survival of the family. Once they arrived at their new western home, women's public role in building western communities and participating in the western economy gave them a greater authority than they had known back East. There was a &quot;female frontier&quot; that was distinct and different from that experienced by men.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Holmes, ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, Introduction by Anne M. Butler, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, (1983) pp 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's diaries kept during their travels or the letters they wrote home once they arrived at their destination supports these contentions. Women wrote with sadness and concern of the numerous deaths along the trail. Anna Maria King wrote to her family in 1845 about her trip to the [[Luckiamute River|Luckiamute Valley]] Oregon and of the multiple deaths experienced by her traveling group:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But listen to the deaths: Sally Chambers, John King and his wife, their little daughter Electa and their babe, a son 9 months old, and Dulancy C. Norton's sister are gone. Mr. A. Fuller lost his wife and daughter Tabitha. Eight of our two families have gone to their long home.&lt;ref&gt;From the letter of Anna Maria King, in Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Similarly, emigrant [[Martha Gay Masterson]], who traveled the trail with her family at the age of 13, mentioned the fascination she and other children felt for the graves and loose skulls they would find near their camps.&lt;ref&gt;Peavy, Linda S., and Ursula Smith. ''Pioneer Women: The Lives of Women on the Frontier''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Anna Maria King, like many other women, also advised family and friends back home of the realities of the trip and offered advice on how to prepare for the trip. Women also reacted and responded, often enthusiastically, to the landscape of the West. Betsey Bayley in a letter to her sister, Lucy P. Griffith described how travelers responded to the new environment they encountered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mountains looked like volcanoes and the appearance that one day there had been an awful thundering of volcanoes and a burning world. The valleys were all covered with a white crust and looked like [[salaratus]]. Some of the company used it to raise their bread.&lt;ref&gt;From the letter of Betsey Bayley, in ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mormon emigration ===
{{Main|Mormon Trail}}

Following persecution and mob action in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and other states, and the assassination of their prophet [[Joseph Smith]] in 1844, [[Mormon]] leader [[Brigham Young]] was chosen by the leaders of the [[Latter Day Saints]] (LDS) church to lead the Mormon settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]] encampments near [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in [[Iowa]] including [[Council Bluffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title = Mormons in Iowa towns |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archive-date = July 19, 2011 |access-date = January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from [[Mississippi]], Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in [[Nebraska]] to [[Fort Laramie]] in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with no one left behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants. Typically taking about 100 days to cover the {{convert|1000|mi|km}} trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about {{convert|15|mi|km}} per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to [[Fort Bridger]], where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as [[Hastings Cutoff]], used by the ill-fated [[Donner Party]] in 1846.

Between 1847 and 1860, over 43,000 Mormon settlers and tens of thousands of travelers on the [[California Trail]] and Oregon Trail followed Young to Utah. After 1848, the travelers headed to California or Oregon resupplied at the Salt Lake Valley, and then went back over the [[Salt Lake Cutoff]], rejoining the trail near the future Idaho&amp;ndash;Utah border at the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] in Idaho.

Starting in 1855, many of the poorer Mormon travelers made the trek with hand built [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcart]]s and fewer wagons. Guided by experienced guides, handcarts—pulled and pushed by two to four people—were as fast as ox-drawn wagons and allowed them to bring {{convert|75|to|100|lb|kg}} of possessions plus some food, bedding, and tents to Utah. Accompanying wagons carried more food and supplies. Upon arrival in Utah, the handcart pioneers were given or found jobs and accommodations by individual Mormon families for the winter until they could become established. About 3,000 out of over 60,000 [[Mormon pioneers]] came across with handcarts.

Along the Mormon Trail, the Mormon pioneers established a number of ferries and made trail improvements to help later travelers and earn much needed money. One of the better known ferries was the Mormon Ferry across the North Platte near the future site of [[Fort Caspar]] in Wyoming which operated between 1848 and 1852 and the [[Green River, Utah|Green River]] ferry near Fort Bridger which operated from 1847 to 1856. The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll of from $3 to $8.

=== California Gold Rush ===
{{Main|California Trail}}

In January 1848, James Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada portion of the [[American River]], sparking the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Peters |first = Arthur K. |title = Seven trail west |publisher = Abbeville Press |year = 1996 |isbn = 978-1-55859-782-2 |url = https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete |url-access = registration |page = [https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete/page/109 109] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about two-thirds of the male population in Oregon went to California in 1848 to cash in on the opportunity. To get there, they helped build the Lassen Branch of the Applegate-Lassen Trail by cutting a wagon road through extensive forests. Many returned with significant gold which helped jump-start the Oregon economy. Over the next decade, gold seekers from the [[Midwest|Midwestern United States]] and [[East Coast of the United States]] dramatically increased traffic on the Oregon and California Trails. The &quot;forty-niners&quot; often chose speed over safety and opted to use shortcuts such as the [[Sublette Cutoff|Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff]] in Wyoming which reduced travel time by almost seven days but spanned nearly {{convert|45|mi|km}} of desert without water, grass, or fuel for fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |title = American West - Oregon Trail |website = American West |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205115352/http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |archive-date = December 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1849 was the first year of large scale [[cholera]] epidemics in the United States, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California—most buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska. The &quot;adjusted&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The 1850 U.S. California Census, the first census that included everyone, showed only about 7,019 females with 4,165 non-native females older than 15 in the state. To find a &quot;correct&quot; census there should be added about 20,000 men and about 1,300 females from San Francisco, Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties whose censuses were lost and not included in the official totals.[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850a-01.pdf] Retrieved August 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 1850 U.S. Census of California showed this rush was overwhelmingly male with about 112,000 males to 8,000 females (with about 5,500 women over age 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850a-01.pdf U.S. Seventh Census 1850: California] Retrieved August 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Women were significantly underrepresented [[Women in the California Gold Rush|in the California Gold Rush]], and sex ratios did not reach essential equality in California (and other western states) until about 1950. The relative scarcity of women gave them many opportunities to do many more things that were not &quot;normally&quot; considered &quot;women's work&quot; of this era. After 1849, the California Gold Rush continued for several years as the miners continued to find about $50,000,000 worth of gold per year at $21 per ounce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/greeley/railroad_to_pacific.html |title = An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco in the Summer of 1859 |last = Greeley |first = Horace |website = www.yosemite.ca.us |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once California was established as a prosperous state, many thousands more emigrated there each year for the opportunities.

=== Later emigration and uses of the trail ===
The trail was still in use during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but traffic declined after 1855 when the [[Panama Railroad]] across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was completed. Paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships, often heavily subsidized to carry the mail, provided rapid transport to and from the east coast and [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, to and from [[Panama]] to ports in California and Oregon.

Over the years many ferries were established to help get across the many rivers on the path of the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, [[Kansas River]], [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]], [[Elkhorn River]], [[Loup River]], Platte River, [[South Platte River]], North Platte River, [[Laramie River]], Green River, [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]], two crossings of the Snake River, [[John Day River]], [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30 per wagon but increased the speed of the transit from about 160 to 170 days in 1843 to 120 to 140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent death by drowning at river crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 410|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1859, an expedition of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers]] led by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] left Camp Floyd, [[Utah]], to establish an army supply route across the [[Great Basin]] to the eastern slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]]. Upon return in early August, Simpson reported that he had surveyed the [[Central Overland Route]] from [[Camp Floyd]] to [[Genoa, Nevada]]. This route went through central Nevada (roughly where [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|U.S. Route 50]] goes today) and was about {{convert|280|mi|km}} shorter than the &quot;standard&quot; [[Humboldt River]] [[California trail]] route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Simpson |first = Capt. J. H. |author-link = James H. Simpson |year = 1876 |title = Report of Explorations across the Great Basin of the Territory of Utah |place = Washington, D.C. |pages = [https://archive.org/details/reportexplorati00simpgoog/page/n27 25]–26 |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office |url = https://archive.org/details/reportexplorati00simpgoog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CentralNevadaRoute.gif|thumb|The Central Route in [[Genoa, Nevada|Nevada]]]]

The Army improved the trail for use by wagons and [[stagecoach]]es in 1859 and 1860. Starting in 1860, the American Civil War closed the heavily subsidized [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] stage Southern Route through the deserts of the American Southwest.

In 1860–61 the [[Pony Express]], employing riders traveling on horseback day and night with relay stations about every {{convert|10|mi|km}} to supply fresh horses, was established from [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], to [[Sacramento, California]]. The Pony Express built many of their eastern stations along the Oregon/California/Mormon/Bozeman trails and many of their western stations along the very sparsely settled [[Central Route]] across Utah and Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pony Express&quot;&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf Pony Express Trail maps], Retrieved January 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Pony Express delivered mail summer and winter in roughly 10 days from the midwest to California.

In 1861, [[John Warren Butterfield|John Butterfield]], who since 1858 had been using the Butterfield Overland Mail, also switched to the Central Route to avoid traveling through hostile territories during the American Civil War. [[George Chorpenning]] immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line along with their stations from the &quot;Northern Route&quot; (California Trail) along the Humboldt River. In 1861, the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] also laid its lines alongside the Central Overland Route. Several stage lines were set up carrying mail and passengers that traversed much of the route of the original Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger and from there over the Central Overland Route to California. By traveling day and night with many stations and changes of teams (and extensive mail subsidies), these stages could get passengers and mail from the midwest to California in about 25 to 28 days. These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Oregon Trail and Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the First Transcontinental Telegraph stations and telegraph line, which followed much the same route in 1861 from [[Carson City, Nevada]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. The Pony Express folded in 1861 as they failed to receive an expected mail contract from the U.S. government and the telegraph filled the need for rapid east&amp;ndash;west communication. This combination wagon/stagecoach/pony express/telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pony Express&quot;/&gt; From Salt Lake City the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon/California/Oregon trails to Omaha, Nebraska.

[[File:Oregon Trail pic.jpg|thumb|left|Covered wagon replica and Mission Monument at the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site]] about ten miles west of Walla Walla, Washington]]

After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, telegraph lines usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and telegraph lines were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. Telegraph lines to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned.

As the years passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used corridor from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots of the trail continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 the population in the states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences.

Even before the famous Texas [[cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] after the Civil War, the trail was being used to drive herds of thousands of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hM2_IXMY3jQC |title = The Plains Across the Overland Emigrants and Trans-Mississippi West 1840–1860 |last = Unruh |first = John D |publisher = University of Illinois Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-252-06360-2 |pages = 392, 512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, there were even records of a 1,500-turkey drive from Illinois to California.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Louise. ''The Beginnings of the West''. 1972. pp 1084–85&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the midwest and at the end of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the midwest for about 1/3 to 1/10 what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the trail large herds of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets.

=== Trail decline ===
The first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, providing faster, safer, and usually cheaper travel east and west (the journey took seven days and cost as little as $65, or $1189.39 in 2016 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |title = Railroad ticket 1870 Transcontinental Railroad Statistics |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624020241/http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |archive-date = June 24, 2009 |access-date = January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some emigrants continued to use the trail well into the 1890s, and modern highways and railroads eventually paralleled large portions of the trail, including [[U.S. Highway 26]], [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] in Oregon and Idaho and [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska. Contemporary interest in the overland trek has prompted the states and federal government to preserve landmarks on the trail including wagon ruts, buildings, and &quot;registers&quot; where emigrants carved their names. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a number of re-enactments of the trek with participants wearing period garments and traveling by wagon.

[[File:South pass marker2.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trail pioneer [[Ezra Meeker]] erected this boulder near [[Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming)|Pacific Springs]] on Wyoming's [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''Ventures and Adventures of Ezra Meeker: Or, Sixty Years of Frontier Life'' by Ezra Meeker. Rainer Printing Company 1908. ASIN: B000861WA8&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As the trail developed it became marked by many cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.

While the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was [[Independence, Missouri]], or [[Westport, Kansas City, Missouri|Westport]], (which was annexed into modern day [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across Kansas, and some towns became starting points, including [[Weston, Missouri|Weston]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|Fort Leavenworth]], [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], St. Joseph, and Omaha.

The Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], at the time the proposed capital of the [[Oregon Territory]]. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.

At dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Many other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of [[California]]; and the Bozeman Trail to [[Montana]]. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established on both sides of the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may have been between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.

Remnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the entire trail is a designated [[National Historic Trail]].

=== Missouri ===
Initially, the main &quot;jumping off point&quot; was the common head of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and Oregon trail&amp;mdash;Independence, and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], they ferried across the Kansas River to start the trek across [[Kansas]] and points west. Another busy &quot;jumping off point&quot; was [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]—established in 1843.&lt;ref name=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/ |title = Saint Peters: Missouri |access-date = August 30, 2007 |publisher = North America Travel Guide |author = North America Travel Guide |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006123625/http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/ |archive-date = October 6, 2007 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to St. Louis and other ports on the combined [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and Mississippi River systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin, [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], and [[Fort Osage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/spacepix/franklin-mo.html |title = Franklin Missouri The Beginning of the Santa Fe Trail |last = Larry and Carolyn |website = www.santafetrailresearch.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson obtained from France the [[Louisiana Purchase]] for $15&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to about $230&amp;nbsp;million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of Iowa and Missouri, located west of the Mississippi River and east of Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805–1806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many [[Sauk people|Sauk]] (Sac) natives and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Native Americans from [[Iowa Territory]]. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President [[Martin Van Buren]] on July 4, 1838, signed the U.S. Congress laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the Platte and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|fur trapper rendezvous]] traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the [[Mormons]], expelled from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], traversed Iowa (on part of the Mormon Trail) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of Nebraska at their [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] near the future city of Omaha, Nebraska. (See: Missouri River settlements (1846–1854))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title = Winter Quarters Project |publisher = Winterquarters.byu.edu |access-date = March 19, 2011 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archive-date = July 19, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mormons established about 50 temporary towns including the town of Kanesville, Iowa (renamed [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] in 1852) on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the mouth of the Platte River. For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction Kanesville and other towns became major &quot;jumping off places&quot; and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]] District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.) By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and &quot;jumping off places&quot; for travelers on the Mormon, California, Oregon, and other trails west.

=== Kansas ===
[[File:Ks rivers.png|thumb|Map of principal rivers in Kansas]]

Starting initially in Independence, Missouri, or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Missouri, the initial trail follows the Santa Fe Trail into Kansas south of the [[Wakarusa River]]. After crossing [[Mount Oread]] at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], the trail crosses the Kansas River by [[ferry]] or boats near Topeka and crossed the Wakarusa and Black Vermillion rivers by ferries.  West of Topeka, the route paralleled what is now [[U.S. Route 24 in Kansas|U.S. Route 24]] until west of St. Mary's. After the Black Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to Nebraska paralleling the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] until reaching the south side of the Platte River.  Destinations along the Oregon Trail in Kansas included [[St. Mary's Mission (Kansas)|St. Mary's Mission]], [[Pottawatomie Indian Pay Station]], [[Louisville, Kansas#Oregon Trail crossing|Vieux's Vermilion Crossing]], [[Alcove Springs]] and [[Hollenberg Pony Express Station|Hollenberg Station]]. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Those emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in Missouri or Iowa used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in Nebraska. Several towns in Nebraska were used as ''jumping off places'' with Omaha eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. [[Fort Kearny]] (est. 1848) is about {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the Platte River west. The army maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.

The Platte River and the North Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was &quot;too thin to plow and too thick to drink&quot;. While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and [[cow dung|buffalo chip]]s for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Mattes, Merrill J. ''The Great Platte River Road''. Bison Books, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|to|60|in|cm}} deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.

In the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of [[bison]] migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Native Americans fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte River. Travelers gathered and ignited dried cow dung to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River Valley into present-day Wyoming heading to Fort Laramie. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.globalclassroom.org/nebraska.html |title = The Oregon Trail in Western Nebraska |website = www.globalclassroom.org |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable landmarks in Nebraska include [[Courthouse and Jail Rocks]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], and [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park|Ash Hollow]] with its steep descent down [[Windlass Hill]] over the South Platte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://gnelson.incolor.com/neocta.html |title = NE - OCTA Home Page |last = Nelson |first = Greg |website = gnelson.incolor.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along Interstate 80 from Wyoming to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], Nebraska. From there [[U.S. Highway 30]] which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/upload/NE_ATRIG_Web.pdf Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming] NPS road guide, accessed February 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cholera on the Platte River ====
Because of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years (1849–1855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. One of the side effects of cholera is acute diarrhea, which helps contaminate even more water unless it is isolated and/or treated. The cause of cholera (ingesting the ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' bacterium from contaminated water) and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Thousands of travelers on the combined California, Oregon, and Mormon trails succumbed to cholera between 1849 and 1855. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. Although also considered part of the [[Mormon Trail]], the grave of [[Rebecca Winters (pioneer)|Rebecca Winters]] is one of the few marked ones left. There are many cases cited involving people who were alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.

=== Colorado ===
A branch of the Oregon trail crossed the very northeast corner of [[Colorado]] if they followed the South Platte River to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present day [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] before entering Wyoming. Later settlers followed the Platte and South Platte Rivers into their settlements there (much of which became the state of Colorado).

=== Wyoming ===
{{Main|Emigrant Trail in Wyoming}}

After crossing the South Platte River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], at the confluence of the Laramie and North Platte rivers, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |title = Chronological List of Fort Laramie History |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121161424/http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |archive-date = November 21, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last army outpost till travelers reached the coast.

The '''Pax Romana''' ([[Latin]] for &quot;Roman Peace&quot;) is a roughly 200-year-long period in [[Roman history]] which is identified with increased and sustained inner [[Pax Romana#Analogous peaces|hegemonial peace]] and [[golden age|stability]] (though not meaning without [[List of Roman wars and battles|wars]], [[Roman expansion|expansion]] and [[List of Roman civil wars and revolts|revolts]]).  It is traditionally dated as commencing from the accession of [[Caesar Augustus]], founder of the [[Roman principate]], in 27 BC and concluding in 180 AD with the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the last of the &quot;[[Five Good Emperors]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/447447/Pax-Romana |title=Pax Romana |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was inaugurated by Augustus with the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]], it is sometimes called the '''Pax Augusta'''.

The Pax Romana is said to have been a &quot;[[miracle]]&quot; because prior to it there had never been peace for so many centuries in a given period of history. However, [[Walter Goffart]] wrote: &quot;The volume of the [[The Cambridge Ancient History|''Cambridge Ancient History'']] for the years AD 70–192 is called 'The Imperial Peace', but peace is not what one finds in its pages&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffart1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55pDIwvWnpoC&amp;pg=PA111|title=Rome's Fall and After|publisher=Hambledon Press|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85285-001-2|page=111|author=Walter Goffart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the [[Roman Republic]] in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: &quot;Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous “Roman Peace” in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: [[Sicily]] after 210 [BC], the [[Italian Peninsula]] after 200 [BC]; the [[Po Valley]] after 190 [BC]; most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] after 133 [BC]; [[North Africa]] after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek East]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RosensteinMorstein-Marx2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Rosenstein |editor2=Robert Morstein-Marx|title=A Companion to the Roman Republic|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4rmmvFAKjoC&amp;pg=PA574|origyear=2006|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5720-2|page=574|chapter=Conceptualizing Roman Imperial Expansion under the Republic: An Introduction|author= Arthur M. Eckstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known record of the term ''Pax Romana'' appears in a writing by [[Seneca the Younger]] in AD 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali Parchami|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pwt6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-00704-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] noted that &quot;''Pax Romana'' is a simple formula for [[propaganda]], but a difficult subject for research.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Momi&quot;/&gt; In fact, the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; was broken by the [[Bellum Batonianum]] (described by [[Suetonius]] as the most serious Roman conflict since the [[Punic Wars]]) of 6-9, the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the [[Kitos War]] (also in Judea, 115–117), the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba Revolt]] (also known as the Third Jewish–Roman War), the [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63]], Trajan's [[Trajan|Roman–Parthian War]] of 113, the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], various battles with Germanic tribes, including the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Teutoburg Forest]], and [[Boudica]]'s war in Britain in AD 60 or 61.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] in the [[Battle of Actium]] on 2 September 31 BC and became Roman emperor.&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul K. |last=Davis |authorlink=Paul K.

Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a [[Military junta|junta]] of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of [[civil war]]. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in [[Hispania]] and in the [[Alps]]. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the [[Gates of Janus]] (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times,&lt;ref&gt;Augustus states in ''Res Gestae'' 13 that he closed the Gates three times, a fact documented by many other historians (See [[Gates of Janus]]).&lt;/ref&gt; first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but [[Inez Scott Ryberg]] (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the [[Ara Pacis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Procession of the Ara Pacis |first=Inez |last=Scott Ryberg |authorlink=Inez Scott Ryberg |journal=Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome |volume=19 |year=1949 |pages=77, 79–101 |doi=10.2307/4238621|jstor=4238621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agPYfLmueWEC |title=Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus' vision of a new world order in 13 BCE. |first=Gaius |last=Stern |year=2010 |origyear=2006 |isbn=978-0-549-83411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Ronald Syme]] had suggested a later date (but Rome was then at war).&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the [[Ludi Saeculares]] in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicized, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Augustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]], who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; Romans regarded peace, not as an absence of war, but the rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Momi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=750454 |title=The Peace of the Ara Pacis |first=Arnaldo |last=Momigliano | journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=5 |year=1942 |pages=228–231 |doi=10.2307/750454 |url=https://people.exeter.ac.uk/jda208/The%20Peace%20of%20the%20Ara%20Pacis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. [[List of Roman emperors|Subsequent emperors]] followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

After Augustus' death in AD 14, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics.  The last five emperors of the Pax Romana were considered the &quot;[[Five Good Emperors]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ushistory/&gt;

==Influence on trade==
Roman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana.  Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices.  Romans benefited from large profits and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Roman market economy|last=Temin|first=Peter|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691147680|location=Princeton|pages=13|language=English|oclc = 784708336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pax Romana : war, peace, and conquest in the Roman world|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian Keith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300178821|location=New Haven|pages=392|oclc=941874968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[German Empire]]'s imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like [[Saxony]]) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire dissolved because the Greek [[city states]] maintained their political identity and more importantly, embryos of their own armed forces. [[Raymond Aron|Aron]] notes that during the Pax Romana, the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish war]] was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, &quot;In other words, ''imperial peace'' becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aron2003&quot;/&gt;

The concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and attempts to  imitate it occurred in the [[Byzantine Empire]], and in the [[Christian West]], where it morphed into the [[Peace and Truce of God]] (''pax Dei'' and ''treuga Dei'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Gress&quot;/&gt; A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was [[Dante Aligheri]]. Dante's works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by [[William Mitchell Ramsay]] in the book ''The Imperial Peace; An Ideal in European History'' (1913).&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Brown Scott]]|title=Law, the State, and the International Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA223|year=2002|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-178-4|pages=223–224|origyear=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialpeaceide00ramsrich|title=The imperial peace; an ideal in European history|work=Internet Archive|publisher=Oxford, The Clarendon Press|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
Birch appeared in commercials in the late 1980s for [[Burger King]], [[California Raisins]], [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]] (alongside [[Wilford Brimley]]), and [[Vlasic Pickles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Paul|last1=Fischer |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1206/thora-birch-for-dungeons-and-dragons |title=Thora Birch for &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; |website=Dark Horizons |date=December 8, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her film debut in the 1988 science-fiction comedy ''[[Purple People Eater (film)|Purple People Eater]]'', for which she won a Youth In Film Award and a [[Young Artist Award]] in the category of &quot;Best Young Actress Under Nine Years of Age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|301|section=awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1988, she guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0564437/|title=Vinnie Video Vici|date=25 October 1989|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was cast as Molly in the NBC television series ''[[Day by Day (American TV series)|Day By Day]]'', being credited as &quot;Thora&quot;. The show aired for two seasons on [[NBC]] and earned her two Young Artist Award nominations.

===1990s===
In 1990, Birch had one of the lead roles in the sitcom ''[[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', based on the [[Parenthood (film)|1989 film of the same name]]. It aired on NBC and was cancelled after one season. In the next year, she starred in the drama ''[[Paradise (1991 film)|Paradise]]'', with [[Don Johnson]], [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Elijah Wood]]. She won her role over more than 4,000 other young hopefuls who auditioned for it. [[Roger Ebert]] felt she played her part with &quot;strong, simple charm&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boone |first=Steven |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/paradise-1991 |title=Paradise Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1991) |publisher=Roger Ebert |date=1991-10-04 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later earned another [[Young Artist Award]] nomination. For the rest of the 1990s, Birch continued to find steady recognition as a [[child actor|child]] and teen actress through leading parts in numerous comedy and family feature films.

In 1991, she starred with [[Ethan Embry]] in the comedy ''[[All I Want for Christmas (film)|All I Want for Christmas]]'', as a girl who plans to get her divorced parents back together for Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vicki Notaro |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/25-christmas-movies-for-the-25th-and-other-days-1.2468598 |title=25 Christmas movies for the 25th (and other days) |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2015-12-19 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mediocre reviews and moderate attention from audiences upon its theatrical release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1039460-all_i_want_for_christmas/|title=All I Want for Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alliwantforchristmas.htm |title=All I Want for Christmas (1991) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=1991-12-31 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but developed a following on television and on [[home video]] in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by Joanna |url=http://www.christmastvhistory.com/2014/08/all-i-want-for-christmas-1991.html |title=All I Want for Christmas (1991) |publisher=Christmas TV History |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/photo-gallery/42799209/image/42801466/All-I-Want-Christmas-1991 |title=All I Want For Christmas (1991) &amp;#124; '90s Movies That Will Bring Back the Magic of Your Childhood Holidays &amp;#124; POPSUGAR Entertainment |publisher=Popsugar.com |date=2016-12-24 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, she played the daughter of [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) in the spy thriller ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'', which was a commercial success, grossing US$178 million at the worldwide box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=patriotgames.htm |title=Patriot Games (1992) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=1992-08-18 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10 years old, Birch appeared in the [[fantasy film|fantasy]] comedy ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993), opposite [[Bette Midler]], [[Kathy Najimy]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. The film saw her play the younger sister of a teenage boy who inadvertently resurrects a villainous trio of witches. ''Hocus Pocus'' rated average with reviewers and made a modest US$39 million in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1045250-hocus_pocus/|title=Hocus Pocus|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hocuspocus.htm |title=Hocus Pocus (1993) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=1993-10-22 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a [[cult film]] due to strong DVD sales and large television following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cavan Sieczkowski |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/five-reasons-why-hocus-pocus-one-greatest-cult-classic-films-325484 |title=Five Reasons Why 'Hocus Pocus' is One of the Greatest Cult Classic Films |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=1993-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-magical-tale-of-how-hocus-pocus-went-from-144105863.html |title=The Magical Tale of How 'Hocus Pocus' Went From Box-Office Flop to Halloween Favorite |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=2015-10-28 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1994 comedy ''[[Monkey Trouble]]'', Birch portrayed a girl who adopts a [[Capuchin monkey]] trained to pick pockets and burglarize houses. The movie had a mixed reception, but Marjorie Baumgarten, for the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', observed that her &quot;nuanced performance (a rarity amongst child performers) no doubt lends ''Monkey Trouble'' its realistic touch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1994-03-25/monkey-trouble/ |title=Monkey Trouble - Film Calendar |newspaper=The Austin Chronicle |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1994, she reprised her ''Patriot Games'' role in the sequel, ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'', which grossed over US$215 million globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=clearandpresentdanger.htm |title=Clear and Present Danger (1994) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=1994-10-25 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Birch was cast as the younger version of Melanie Griffith's character in the [[coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] film ''[[Now and Then (film)|Now and Then]]'', also starring [[Gaby Hoffmann]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. It was released to largely mediocre reviews, but proved to be a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nowandthen.htm |title=Now and Then (1995) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=1995-12-05 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She landed a leading role in the adventure drama ''[[Alaska (1996 film)|Alaska]]'' (1996) opposite [[Vincent Kartheiser]], portraying two siblings who search through the Alaskan wilderness for their lost father ([[Dirk Benedict]]). For the next two years, she did not appear in a film but guest-starred in ''[[Promised Land (TV series)|Promised Land]]'' and ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superiorpics.com/thora_birch/ |title=The Thora Birch Picture Pages |publisher=Superiorpics.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently filmed the [[television film|made-for-television]] film ''Night Ride Home'' and an uncredited role for ''[[Anywhere but Here (film)|Anywhere but Here]]'', both released in 1999.

Also in 1999, she appeared in the [[Sam Mendes]]-directed drama ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', as Jane Burnham, the insecure daughter of [[Kevin Spacey]]'s character. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' felt Birch &quot;[glimmered] with grown-up radiance&quot; in her role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Travers |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Travers|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/american-beauty-19990915 |title=American Beauty |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 1, 1999|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she later received a [[BAFTA Award]] nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=American%20Beauty |title=BAFTA Awards Search &amp;#124; BAFTA Awards |publisher=Awards.bafta.org |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the recipient of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2000 |title=2000 &amp;#124; Oscars.org &amp;#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=March 26, 2000 |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed over US$356 million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=americanbeauty.htm |title=American Beauty (1999) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerging as the biggest commercial success of Birch's career to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/person/14640401-Thora-Birch#tab=acting |title=Thora Birch - Box Office |publisher=The Numbers |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Following her success with ''American Beauty'', she appeared in two films released in 2000. The small-scale drama ''[[The Smokers (film)|The Smokers]]'' received a straight-to-DVD release in the US, going largely unnoticed, but Birch was called &quot;a scene-stealer&quot; in her supporting role by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0185908/|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|title=Film review: 'Smokers'|date=20 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other film of the year was the poorly received ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', a fantasy film based on the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|role-playing game of the same name]]. In 2001, she starred with [[Keira Knightley]] in the horror film ''[[The Hole (2001 film)|The Hole]]'', in which her headlining credit and highly publicized seven figure salary was attributed to her appearance in ''American Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netribution.co.uk/features/interviews/2001/thora_birch/1.html Interview with Birch], just after the film's release in the UK&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in theaters in the UK, and on DVD in the US, receiving mixed reviews. Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, Derek Elley stated that Birch gave &quot;an effectively creepy lead [performance]&quot; in the film, which he called &quot;a clunky British attempt to merge the psychothriller and teen movie genres&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Derek Elley |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/the-hole-3-1200467768/ |title=The Hole |magazine=Variety |date=2001-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birch headlined the 2001 [[black comedy]] ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'', directed by [[Terry Zwigoff]] and co-starring [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Brad Renfro]]. The film, focused on the lives of two teenage outsiders (Birch and Johansson) in an unnamed American city, was released in a specialty theatrical run, to a highly favorable critical reception. [[James Berardinelli]] found Birch's part to be her &quot;first effectively developed role&quot; since ''American Beauty'' and positively singled out the actress for the &quot;quirkiness [and the] underlying sense of melancholy and ennui&quot; in her portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A movie review by James Berardinelli |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/ghost_world.html |title=Ghost World &amp;#124; Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date=2001-08-03 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-02-10/news/0202100096_1_afi-nominations-golden-globe |title=The contenders |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=2002-02-10 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fonda - Birch at 2015 HFA.jpg|thumb|upright=.65|left|[[Jane Fonda]] backstage with Birch before being honored at the 2015 [[Hollywood Film Awards]]]]
Birch appeared as the [[Liz Murray|title character]] in the biographical [[television film]] ''[[Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story]]'' (2003), playing a young woman who, after becoming homeless at 15 amid personal tragedies, begins her work to finish her studies. She garnered acclaim for her part, receiving an Emmy nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/thora-birch |title=Thora Birch Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her professional achievements in the 1990s and early 2000s, Birch's profile decreased significantly in the next decade, as she had more infrequent acting appearances in much smaller-scale productions. Reflecting on her career trajectory the subsequent years during a January 2014 interview, she attributed it to not &quot;taking&quot; the demands the film industry had for her, opting to &quot;maintain a strong identity and pursue things that were a little more thoughtful, and I guess nobody really wanted women to do that at that time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Had&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Thora Birch: how Hollywood's darling disappeared|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/23/thora-birch-hollywood-darling-disappeared?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 January 2014|author=Hadley Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birch appeared in several music videos including [[Moby]]'s &quot;[[We Are All Made of Stars#Music video|We Are All Made of Stars]]&quot;, and [[Limp Bizkit]]'s &quot;[[Eat You Alive]]&quot;, which also featured [[Bill Paxton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb24kLd459Y |title=Limp Bizkit - Eat You Alive |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1rFAaAKpVc |title=Moby 'We Are All Made of Stars' - Official video |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She played a supporting role in ''[[Silver City (2004 film)|Silver City]]'', a political satire written and directed by [[John Sayles]], which premiered at the 2004 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 2006, Birch had the lead role in the horror-thriller ''[[Dark Corners]]'', portraying a troubled young woman who wakes up one day as a different person—someone who is stalked by creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|485376|Dark Corners}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film did not receive a theatrical release, and instead, went straight to DVD. It rated poorly with reviewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/anchhor2.htm#dark |title=Three Horror Films from Anchor Bay - Reviews by David Nusair |publisher=Reelfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Birch was considered &quot;convincing as the two halves of this split personality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/dark-corners-film-review-by-tony-sullivan |title=Dark Corners (2006) Movie Review |publisher=Eye for Film |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed with the female lead role in the 2008 [[slasher film|slasher]] ''[[Train (film)|Train]]'', which revolved around a group of US college athletes who get stalked and killed in an Eastern Europe train. The film received a DVD release, to a mediocre overall reception, with critics comparing it unfavorably to ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' and ''[[Turistas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com.co/2008/10/train.html |title=Horror Movie A Day: Train (2008) |publisher=Horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com.co |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Film Review: Train (2008) |url=https://horrornews.net/19438/film-review-train-2008/ |title=Film Review: Train (2008) |publisher=Horrornews.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

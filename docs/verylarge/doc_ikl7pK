[[File:1878 poster for Jacques Offenbach's Orphée aux enfers.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=Colourful theatre poster depicting a party in Hades|Poster for Paris revival, 1878]]
'''''Orpheus in the Underworld'''''&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; and '''''Orpheus in Hell'''''&lt;ref name=g276/&gt; are English names for '''''Orphée aux enfers''''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔʁfe oz‿ɑ̃fɛʁ|lang}}), a comic opera with music by [[Jacques Offenbach]] and words by [[Hector-Jonathan Crémieux|Hector Crémieux]] and [[Ludovic Halévy]]. It was first performed as a two-act &quot;[[opéra bouffon]]&quot; at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens]], Paris, on 21 October 1858, and was extensively revised and expanded in a four-act &quot;[[opéra féerie]]&quot; version, presented at the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (rue Papin)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], Paris, on 7 February 1874.

The opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]]. In this version Orpheus is not the son of [[Apollo]] but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of [[Mount Olympus#Name and mythological associations|Olympus]] in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of [[Napoleon III]], Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists' disrespect for classic mythology and the composer's parody of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]''; others praised the piece highly.

''Orphée aux enfers'' was Offenbach's first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulty. The 1874 revival broke records at the Gaîté's box-office. The work was frequently staged in France and internationally during the composer's lifetime and throughout the 20th century. It is his most often performed opera and continues to be revived in the 21st century.

In the last decade of the 19th century the Paris cabarets the [[Moulin Rouge]] and [[Folies Bergère]] adopted the music of the &quot;[[Galop]] infernal&quot; from the culminating scene of the opera to accompany the [[can-can]], and ever since then the tune has been popularly associated with the dance.

Between 1855 and 1858 [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] presented more than two dozen one-act [[List of operettas by Jacques Offenbach|operettas]], first at the [[Théâtre des Folies-Marigny|Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze]], and then at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens|Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul]]. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question.&lt;ref name=g49/&gt; In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer [[Hector-Jonathan Crémieux|Hector Crémieux]] that when he was musical director of the [[Comédie-Française]] in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there.&lt;ref&gt;Teneo, Martial.

The first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner.&lt;ref&gt;Gammond, p. 49; and Yon, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic [[Jules Janin]] of the ''[[Journal des débats]]''.

In 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate [[opéra bouffon]] of 1858 into a four-act [[opéra féerie]] extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences.

A spoken introduction with orchestral accompaniment (Introduction and Melodrame) opens the work. Public Opinion explains who she is – the guardian of morality (&quot;Qui suis-je? du Théâtre Antique&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; She says that unlike the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in Ancient Greek plays she does not merely comment on the action, but intervenes in it, to make sure the story maintains a high moral tone. Her efforts are hampered by the facts of the matter: Orphée is not the son of [[Apollo]], as in classical myth, but a rustic teacher of music, whose dislike of his wife, Eurydice, is heartily reciprocated. She is in love with the shepherd, Aristée (Aristaeus), who lives next door (&quot;La femme dont le coeur rêve&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; and Orphée is in love with Chloë, a shepherdess. When Orphée mistakes Eurydice for her, everything comes out, and Eurydice insists they abandon the marriage. Orphée, fearing Public Opinion's reaction, torments his wife into keeping the scandal quiet using violin music, which she hates (&quot;Ah, c'est ainsi&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristée enters. Though seemingly a shepherd he is in reality Pluton (Pluto), God of the Underworld. He keeps up his disguise by singing a pastoral song about sheep (&quot;Moi, je suis Aristée&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Eurydice has discovered what she thinks is a plot by Orphée to kill Aristée – letting snakes loose in the fields – but is in fact a conspiracy between Orphée and Pluton to kill her, so that Pluton may have her and Orphée be rid of her. Pluton tricks her into walking into the trap by showing immunity to it, and she is bitten.{{refn|In their plot summary in ''Gänzl's Book of Musical Theatre'', [[Kurt Gänzl]] and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] write &quot;she gets an asp in the ankle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl and Lamb, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} As she dies, Pluton transforms into his true form (Transformation Scene).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Eurydice finds that death is not so bad when the God of Death is in love with one (&quot;La mort m'apparaît souriante&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 29–29&lt;/ref&gt; They descend into the Underworld as soon as Eurydice has left a note telling her husband she has been unavoidably detained.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

All seems to be going well for Orphée until Public Opinion catches up with him, and threatens to ruin his violin teaching career unless he goes to rescue his wife. Orphée reluctantly agrees.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

====Act 1, Scene 2: Olympus====
The scene changes to Olympus, where the Gods are sleeping (&quot;Dormons, dormons&quot;). Cupidon and Vénus enter separately from amatory nocturnal escapades and join their sleeping colleagues,{{refn|In the 1874 revision a third verse is added for Mars, also returning from a night on the tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Offenbach (1874) pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} but everyone is soon woken by the sound of the horn of Diane, supposedly chaste huntress and goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; She laments the sudden absence of [[Actaeon]], her current love (&quot;Quand Diane descend dans la plaine&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; to her indignation, Jupiter tells her he has turned Actaeon into a stag to protect her reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercury arrives and reports that he has visited the Underworld, to which Pluton has just returned with a beautiful woman.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Pluton enters, and is taken to task by Jupiter for his scandalous private life.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 48–52&lt;/ref&gt; To Pluton's relief the other Gods choose this moment to revolt against Jupiter's reign, their boring diet of ambrosia and nectar, and the sheer tedium of Olympus (&quot;Aux armes, dieux et demi-dieux!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter's demands to know what is going on lead them to point out his hypocrisy in detail, poking fun at all his mythological affairs (&quot;Pour séduire Alcmène la fière&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Orphée's arrival, with Public Opinion at his side, has the gods on their best behaviour (&quot;Il approche! Il s'avance&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt; Orphée obeys Public Opinion and pretends to be pining for Eurydice: he illustrates his supposed pain with a snatch of &quot;Che farò senza Euridice&quot; from [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orfeo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Offenbach (1859), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Pluton is worried he will be forced to give Eurydice back; Jupiter announces that he is going to the Underworld to sort everything out. The other gods beg to come with him, he consents, and mass celebrations break out at this holiday (&quot;Gloire! gloire à Jupiter&amp;nbsp;... Partons, partons&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Act 2, Scene 1: Pluton's boudoir in the Underworld====
[[File:Désiré-as-Jupiter-1858.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=man dressed up as a fly|Jupiter transformed into a fly – [[Désiré (baritone)|Désiré]], in the 1858 production]]
Eurydice is being kept locked up by Pluton, and is finding life very tedious. Her gaoler is a dull-witted tippler by the name of John Styx. Before he died, he was King of Boeotia (a region of Greece that [[Aristophanes]] made synonymous with country bumpkins),&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, Paul A. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25598406 &quot;The Small and Great Daidala in Boiotian History&quot;], ''Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte'',  56, no. 4 (2007), p. 381 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he sings Eurydice a doleful lament for his lost kingship. (&quot;Quand j'étais roi de Béotie&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter discovers where Pluton has hidden Eurydice, and slips through the keyhole by turning into a beautiful, golden fly. He meets Eurydice on the other side, and sings a love duet with her where his part consists entirely of buzzing (&quot;Duo de la mouche&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he reveals himself to her, and promises to help her, largely because he wants her for himself. Pluton is left furiously berating John Styx.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Act 2, Scene 2: The banks of the Styx====
The scene shifts to a huge party the gods are having, where ambrosia, nectar, and propriety are nowhere to be seen (&quot;Vive le vin! Vive Pluton!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Eurydice is present, disguised as a [[bacchante]] (&quot;J'ai vu le dieu Bacchus&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; but Jupiter's plan to sneak her out is interrupted by calls for a dance. Jupiter insists on a minuet, which everybody else finds boring (&quot;La la la. Le menuet n'est vraiment si charmant&quot;). Things liven up as the most famous number in the opera, the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, begins, and all present throw themselves into it with wild abandon (&quot;Ce bal est original&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Ominous violin music heralds the approach of Orphée (Entrance of Orphée and Public Opinion),&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; but Jupiter has a plan, and promises to keep Eurydice away from her husband. As with the standard myth, Orphée must not look back, or he will lose Eurydice forever (&quot;Ne regarde pas en arrière!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Public Opinion keeps a close eye on him, to keep him from cheating, but Jupiter throws a lightning bolt, making him jump and look back, Eurydice vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the ensuing turmoil, Jupiter proclaims that she will henceforth belong to the god Bacchus and become one of his priestesses. Public Opinion is not pleased, but Pluton has had enough of Eurydice, Orphée is free of her, and all ends happily.&lt;ref&gt;Crémieux, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised 1874 version===
The plot is essentially that of the 1858 version. Instead of two acts with two scenes apiece, the later version is in four acts, which follow the plot of the four scenes of the original. The revised version differs from the first in having several interpolated ballet sequences, and some extra characters and musical numbers. The additions do not affect the main narrative but add considerably to the length of the score.{{refn|The 1858 version of the vocal score runs to 147 pages; the 1874 vocal score issued by the same firm is 301 pages long.&lt;ref name=simeone/&gt;|group=n|name=long}} In Act I there is an opening chorus for assembled shepherds and shepherdesses, and Orpheus has a group of youthful violin students, who bid him farewell at the end of the act. In Act 2 Mercure is given a solo entrance number (&quot;Eh hop!&quot;). In Act 3, Eurydice has a new solo, the &quot;Couplets des regrets&quot; (&quot;Ah! quelle triste destinée!&quot;), Cupidon has a new number, the &quot;Couplets des baisers&quot; (&quot;Allons, mes fins limiers&quot;), the three judges of Hades and a little band of policemen are added to the cast to be involved in Jupiter's search for the concealed Eurydice, and at the end of the act the furious Pluton is seized and carried off by a swarm of flies.&lt;ref name=simeone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notes to EMI LP set SLS 5175 (1979) {{oclc|869200562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an &quot;abundance of couplets&quot; (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), &quot;a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales&quot;. Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles – from [[Rococo#music|Rococo]] pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop – displaying, in Faris's analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that &quot;leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well&quot;. In such up-tempo numbers as the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, pp. 66–67 and 69&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the &quot;duo de la mouche&quot; Jupiter's part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing [[Glossary of musical terminology#sul ponticello|sul ponticello]], to produce a similarly buzzing sound.&lt;ref&gt;Offenbach-Keck, pp. 227–229.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Gustave Lafargue remarked that Offenbach's use of a piccolo trill punctuated by a tap on a cymbal in the finale of the first scene was a modern recreation of an effect invented by Gluck in his score of ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name=gl&gt;Lafargue, Gustave. [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k275142w/f3.item.zoom &quot;Chronique musicale&quot;], ''Le Figaro'', 10 February 1874, p. 3 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|&quot;l'effet du groupetto de petite flûte et le coup de cymbale … qui renouavelle un effet invente par Gluck dans sa partition d'''Iphigénie en Aulide''.&lt;ref name=gl/&gt;|group=n}} [[Wilfrid Mellers]] also remarks on Offenbach's use of the piccolo to enhance Eurydice's couplets with &quot;girlish giggles&quot; on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Mellers, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gervase Hughes]] comments on the elaborate scoring of the &quot;ballet des mouches&quot; [Act 3, 1874 version], and calls it &quot;a ''tour de force''&quot; that could have inspired [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1962), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Orphéé aux enfers 3 numbers compared.tif|thumb|upright=1.75|alt=three individual lines of a musical score|Opening themes of &quot;Quand j'étais roi de Béotie&quot;, &quot;J'ai vu le Dieu Bacchus&quot; and the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, showing main notes in common: A–C{{music|sharp}}–E–C{{music|sharp}}–B–A&lt;ref&gt;Simplified version of illustration in Faris, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Faris comments that in ''Orphée aux enfers'' Offenbach shows that he was a master of establishing mood by the use of rhythmic figures. Faris instances three numbers from the second act (1858 version), which all are in the key of [[A major]] and use identical notes in almost the same order, &quot;but it would be hard to imagine a more extreme difference in feeling than that between the song of the King of the Boeotians and the ''Galop''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study Heather Hadlock comments that for the former, Offenbach composed &quot;a languid yet restless melody&quot; over a static [[Musette de cour|musette]]-style [[Pastorale|drone-bass]] accompaniment of alternating [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] and [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] harmonies, simultaneously evoking and mocking nostalgia for a lost place and time and &quot;creating a perpetually unresolved tension between pathos and irony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hadlock, pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Mellers finds that Styx's aria has &quot;a pathos that touches the heart&quot; – perhaps, he suggests, the only instance of true feeling in the opera.&lt;ref&gt;Mellers, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Thomas Schipperges wrote in the ''International Journal of Musicology'' that many scholars hold that Offenbach's music defies all [[musicological]] methods. He did not agree, and analysed the &quot;Galop infernal&quot;, finding it to be sophisticated in many details: &quot;For all its straightforwardness, it reveals a calculated design. The overall 'economy' of the piece serves a deliberate musical [[dramaturgy]].&quot;&lt;ref name=musico/&gt;  Hadlock observes that although the best-known music in the opera is &quot;driven by the propulsive energies of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossinian]] comedy&quot; and the up-tempo galop, such lively numbers go side by side with statelier music in an 18th-century vein: &quot;The score's sophistication results from Offenbach's intertwining of contemporary urban musical language with a restrained and wistful tone that is undermined and ironized without ever being entirely undone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hadlock, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orphée aux enfers'' was the first of Offenbach's major works to have a chorus.{{refn|There were choruses in his earlier one-act pieces ''[[Ba-ta-clan]]'' (1855) and ''[[Mesdames de la Halle]]'' (1858).&lt;ref&gt;Harding,  pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In a 2017 study Melissa Cummins comments that although the composer used the chorus extensively as Pluton's minions, bored residents of Olympus, and bacchantes in Hades, they are merely there to fill out the vocal parts in the large ensemble numbers, and &quot;are treated as a nameless, faceless crowd who just happen to be around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, Melissa.

The orchestra at the Bouffes-Parisiens was small – probably about thirty players.&lt;ref name=simeone/&gt; The 1858 version of ''Orphée aux enfers'' is scored for two flutes (the second doubling piccolo), one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, two horns, two [[cornets]],{{refn|Offenbach specified cornets in this score; in other operas, such as ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'' he wrote for trumpets.&lt;ref&gt;Schuesselin, John Christopher.

For the premiere of the revised version he engaged an orchestra of sixty players, as well as a military band of a further forty players for the procession of the gods from Olympus at the end of the second act.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the 1874 revision was well received by contemporary reviewers,&lt;ref name=gl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, H.

The best-known and much-recorded ''Orphée aux enfers'' overture&lt;ref name=g69/&gt; is not by Offenbach, and is not part of either the 1858 or the 1874 scores.

Fifteen years or so after Offenbach's death the galop from Act 2 (or Act 4 in the 1874 version) became one of the world's most famous pieces of music,&lt;ref name=simeone/&gt; when the [[Moulin Rouge]] and the [[Folies Bergère]] adopted it as the regular music for their [[can-can]]. Keck has commented that the original &quot;infernal galop&quot; was a considerably more spontaneous and riotous affair than the fin de siècle can-can (Keck likens the original to a modern [[rave]]) but the tune is now inseparable in the public mind from high-kicking female can-can dancers.&lt;ref name=simeone/&gt;

:With ''Orphée aux enfers'', the genre we now know as operetta gathered its forces and leapt forward, while still retaining the quick, concise style of its one-Act predecessors, their absurdist and risqué sensibility, and their economy in creating maximum comic impact with limited resources. At the same time, it reflects Offenbach's desire to establish himself and his company as legitimate heirs of the eighteenth-century French comic tradition of [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and [[André Grétry|Grétry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hadlock, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

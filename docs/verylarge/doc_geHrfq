== Context and drift ==
Some phrases that are euphemisms in certain contexts can be considered dysphemistic in others. These are often referred to as X-phemisms:&lt;ref name=Metaphor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaff|first=Kerry|author2=Raymond W. Gibbs |author3=Michael D. Johnson |doi=10.1017/S0142716400009875|title=Metaphor in using and understanding euphemism and dysphemism|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|year=1997|volume=18|issue=1|pages=59–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether the utterance is dysphemistic or not depending on the context of the utterance. For example, many X-phemisms regarding [[sexual intercourse]] could be considered euphemistic within peer groups yet dysphemistic in certain audiences. One might be more likely to say that one &quot;got laid&quot; to a friend than to one's grandparents.&lt;ref name=Metaphor /&gt;

There may also be instances in which conflicting definitions of the same word may lead to unintentional dysphemism. The pejorative use of the word [[terrorist]] is a salient example, as definitions of the word terrorist may vary across cultures and even within individuals in the same culture. Typically the word &quot;terrorist&quot; refers to one who uses violence and fear as a means to pursue political, religious or ideological aims. This definition is ambiguous, and many groups that refer to themselves as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;liberators&quot; are referred to as &quot;terrorists&quot; by dissenting parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting Words&quot; /&gt; Labeling groups as terrorist draws associations with other groups labeled as such even when no direct connection might be present. In 2003, the Philippine government's intention to label the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] as a terrorist organization was indicated by the organization to be an escalation of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting Words&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhatia|first=Michael|title=Fighting Words: Naming Terrorists, Bandits, Rebels and Other Violent Actors|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1080/0143659042000322874|url=http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/courses/PoliticalScience/357B1/documents/BhatiaFightingWordsNamingTerroristsBanditsRebels.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2014|url-status=dead|archivedate=24 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624113340/http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/courses/PoliticalScience/357B1/documents/BhatiaFightingWordsNamingTerroristsBanditsRebels.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was their belief that by calling their organization a terrorist organization they were being directly compared to Al-Qaeda, with whom they claim no connection. Naming groups in this way has been described, &quot;A name will place emphasis on certain aspects and characteristics of an object, while neglecting or omitting other key areas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting Words&quot; /&gt;

The interpretation and the production of a text (whether it be written, verbal, or multi-modal) depends on the previous knowledge and experience of the interpreter or producer. The individual compares matching features with representations stored in their long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairclough|first=Norman|title=Language and power|year=2001|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow, [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-41483-9|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/languagepower00fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain lexical items can be used to activate these representations, conjuring stereotypical images which then become the prototype in the listener's mind. Dysphemic terms activate negative stereotypes present in the listener's memory and affect their interpretation of the given text.

=== Move from euphemism to dysphemism ===

The process of [[pejoration]] leads to words that were once considered euphemisms to now be considered dysphemisms. In [[American culture]], words like &quot;colored&quot; were once considered euphemisms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Obscenity Symbol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=Allan|title=An Obscenity Symbol|journal=American Speech|year=1934|volume=9|issue=4|doi=10.2307/452191}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have since been replaced by terms like &quot;black&quot; and &quot;African-American&quot;. Sometimes slight modifications of dysphemisms can make them acceptable: while &quot;colored people&quot; is considered dysphemistic, &quot;people of color&quot; does not carry the same connotations.
The words &quot;[[idiot]]&quot; and &quot;[[moron (psychology)|moron]]&quot; were once polite terms to refer to people with mental disabilities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mismeasure of Man&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|title=The mismeasure of man|url=https://archive.org/details/mismeasureofman00goul_1|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03972-2|edition=Rev. and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are now rarely used without dysphemism. Likewise, the word &quot;retarded&quot; was introduced as a new polite form once the previous terms were outdated. Since then &quot;retard&quot; has been used dysphemistically, suggesting that this term might now be outdated as well. Often a word with both taboo and non-taboo meanings becomes restricted to the taboo definition alone. The term &quot;[[euphemism treadmill]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Blank Slate&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200334-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Steven Pinker]], describes this process, in which terms with an emotionally charged referent that were once euphemisms become dysphemistic by association with the referent.

=== Reclamation of dysphemisms ===

&quot;[[Nigger]]&quot; would typically be dysphemistic; however, if used between African-Americans it may be seen as neutral (although extremely casual) by the listener, depending on their social distance from the speaker and perceived status relative to the other party;&lt;ref name=&quot;E &amp; D&quot; /&gt; see &quot;[[nigga]]&quot;.

[[Reappropriation|Reclamations]] of taboo terms have been both successful and unsuccessful. The term &quot;[[chicano]]&quot; was a derogatory term and has been successfully reclaimed. Some terms like &quot;[[Yankee]]&quot; (for an American) or &quot;punk&quot; (for a late 1970s rocker), began as derogatory but were not considered such and adopted proudly by the named group. There have also been movements to reclaim words for homosexuals such as &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;dyke&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawson 1989&quot; /&gt;

Other historic examples of dysphemism reclamation include the term [[Impressionism]], which originated as a critical remark that &quot;[[Monet]]'s ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' was not art, it was an impression&quot;, but was adopted to be the formal name of the style, and was accepted by the artists themselves.

== Taboo terms ==
[[Taboo]] terms are used as insults, epithets, and expletives because they damage the listener's face, which might destroy social harmony—especially if the speaker and listener are socially distant from each other. For this reason, terms of insult are socially taboo and dysphemistic. Breaking a social taboo can act as an emotional release, with the illocutionary act of expressing a feeling or attitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;E &amp; D&quot; /&gt;

Bad or taboo words for many things far outnumber the &quot;good&quot; words. Hugh Rawson notices in his book ''Wicked Words'' that when looking at Roget's International Thesaurus, there are &quot;...89 synonyms for drunk, compared to 16 for sober, and 206 for bad person compared to 82 for good person. The synonyms for unchastity in the Thesaurus fill 140 lines, occupying exactly four times as much space as those for chastity. For unchaste woman, 34 synonyms are listed; for unchaste man, 24. No synonyms at all are given for chaste woman and chaste man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawson 1989&quot; /&gt;

Bodily effluvia, or bodily excretions, are perennial targets for dysphemy. Many communities historically believed that bodily effluvia such as [[feces]], [[spittle]], [[blood]], nail-parings, and hair-clippings were cursed. Such revulsion is apparently learned: children and animals are not put off by bodily effluvia (unless they have a foul smell). In a study done at Monash and La Trobe Universities in [[Melbourne, Australia]], subjects rated bodily effluvia according to how revolting they found them. Feces, vomit, [[semen]] and menstrual blood were rated as most revolting while nail parings, breath, blood from a wound, hair clippings, and breast milk were rated as least revolting.&lt;ref name=&quot;E &amp; D&quot; /&gt; This continuum of the level of revulsion is apparent in certain dysphemism such as ''shitter'' for &quot;toilet&quot;, ''to come'' for &quot;to ejaculate&quot;, and ''puke hole'' for &quot;tavern&quot; or &quot;toilet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slang &amp; Euphemism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Spears|first=Richard A.|title=Slang and euphemism: a dictionary of oaths, curses, insults, ethnic slurs, sexual slang and metaphor, drug talk, college lingo, and related matters|year=2001|publisher=Signet|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-451-20371-7|edition=3. rev. and abridged}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Secretary of the Interior''' is the head of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. The Secretary and the Department of the Interior are responsible for the management and conservation of most [[federal land]] and [[natural resources]], leading such agencies as the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[United States Geological Survey]], and the [[National Park Service]].  The Secretary also serves on and appoints the private citizens on the [[National Park Foundation]] Board. The Secretary is a member of the [[United States Cabinet]] and reports to the [[President of the United States]]. The U.S. Department of the Interior should not be confused with the [[Interior ministry|Ministries of the Interior]], as used in many other countries. 

As the policies and activities of the Department of the Interior and many of its agencies have a substantial impact in the [[Western United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_wests_new_land_lords/C41/L41/ Salazar, Vilsack: The West's New Land Lords] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220221345/http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_wests_new_land_lords/C41/L41/ |date=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Secretary of the Interior has typically come from a western state; only one Secretary since 1949, [[Rogers Morton]], was not a resident or native of a state lying west of the [[Mississippi River]]. 

The current Secretary of the Interior is [[David Bernhardt]], who held the office in an acting capacity until April 2019. He succeeded [[Ryan Zinke]], who resigned on January 2, 2019.

==Line of succession==
The line of succession for the Secretary of Interior is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/0/doc/951/Page1.aspx|title=Chapter 3: SECRETARIAL SUCCESSION (2) - Laserfiche WebLink|website=elips.doi.gov|access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The English Patient''''' is a 1992 novel by [[Michael Ondaatje]]. The book follows four dissimilar people brought together at an Italian villa during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The four main characters are: an unrecognisably burned man — the eponymous patient, presumed to be English; his [[Canadian Army|Canadian Army nurse]], a [[Sikh]] [[British Army]] [[sapper]], and a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[thief]]. The story occurs during the [[North African Campaign]] and centres on the incremental revelations of the patient's actions prior to his injuries, and the emotional effects of these revelations on the other characters. The story is told by multiple characters and &quot;authors&quot; of books the characters are reading. The book won the 1992 [[Booker Prize]], the 2018 [[The Golden Man Booker|Golden Man Booker]], and the [[Governor General's Award]].

The book is, in part, a sequel to ''[[In the Skin of a Lion]]'', continuing the characters of Hana and Caravaggio, as well as revealing the fate of the latter's main character, Patrick Lewis.

==Plot synopsis==
[[File:Fiesole, villa san girolamo vista da san francesco 02.JPG|thumb|Villa San Girolamo in [[Fiesole]] (Florence)]]
The novel's historical backdrop is the [[North African Campaign|North African]]/[[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaigns]] of [[World War II]]. The story is told out of sequence, moving back and forth between the severely burned &quot;English&quot; patient's memories from before his accident and current events at the bomb-damaged [[Church of San Girolamo|Villa San Girolamo]] (in [[Fiesole]]), an Italian monastery, where he is being cared for by Hana, a troubled young Canadian Army nurse. A few chapters are also devoted to Kip, an Indian [[Sikh]], during his time in England training and working as a [[sapper]] on unexploded ordnance.

The English patient's only possession is a well-worn and heavily annotated copy of [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' that has survived the fiery parachute drop.{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=16}} Hearing the book constantly being read aloud to him brings about detailed recollections of his desert explorations, yet he is unable to recall his own name. Instead, he chooses to believe the assumption by others that he is an Englishman based on the sound of his voice. The patient is in fact [[Laszlo de Almasy|László de Almásy]], a Hungarian Count and desert explorer, one of many members of a British [[cartography]] group.

Caravaggio, an Italian-Canadian in the British foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, is a friend of Hana and Patrick, her mother's lover. He had remained in North Africa to spy when the German forces gain control and then transfers to Italy. He is eventually caught, interrogated, and tortured; they even cut off his thumbs.{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=54}} After the war, he recovers at an hospital for over four months before he accidentally overhears about the patient and Hana. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars from his painful war experience for which he seeks vengeance.

During a thunderstorm, Kip and another British soldier arrive at the villa while Hana is playing on the piano. Kip decides to stay at the villa to attempt to clear it of unexploded ordnance. Kip and the English patient immediately become friends due to the latter's extensive knowledge on both Allied and enemy weaponry and a detailed topography of [[Tuscany]]. At one point, Hana risks her life while Kip is defusing a bomb telling him later that she had hoped both of them had died. Shortly after, Kip and Hana develop feelings for one another and begin a relationship.

The English patient, sedated by morphine, begins to reveal everything: he fell in love with the Englishwoman Katharine Clifton who, with her husband Geoffrey, accompanied Almásy's [[desert exploration]] team. Almásy was mesmerized by Katharine's voice as she read Herodotus' tale of [[Candaules]] aloud by the campfire.{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=233}} They soon began a very intense affair, but she cut it short, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he were to discover them.

Geoffrey offers to return Almásy to [[Cairo]] on his plane since the expedition will break camp with the coming of war. Almásy is unaware that Katharine is aboard the plane as it flies low over him and then crashes. Geoffrey is killed outright. Katharine is injured internally and Almásy leaves her in [[Cave of Swimmers|the Cave of Swimmers]]. Caravaggio tells Almásy that British Intelligence knew about the affair. Almásy makes a three-day trek to British-controlled [[El Tag|El Taj]] for help. When he arrives, he is detained as a spy because of his name, despite telling them about Katharine's predicament. He later guides German spies across the desert to Cairo. Almásy retrieves Katharine's dead body from the Cave and, while flying back, the decrepit plane leaks oil onto him and both of them catch fire. He parachutes from the plane and is found severely burned by the Bedouin.

Towards the end of the novel, Kip learns that the U.S. has [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] over his headset and a situation develops where he nearly shoots the English patient. Hana calms him down and Caravaggio reflects that they would not have dropped that kind of bomb on a white nation. Kip departs from the villa, estranged from his white companions, and returns to India. He marries and has two children though he still thinks of Hana.

==Characters==

===Almásy===
Count Ladislaus de Almásy is the titular character who comes under Hana's care in Italy after being burned unrecognizably in Africa. Although Hungarian by birth, because he has lived without government identification or many verifiable long-term interactions, his accent prompts the authorities around him to perceive an English affiliation and to refer to him as the English Patient. Almásy serves as a blank canvas onto which the other characters project their experience during this time in Italy. For example, Hana treats him tenderly to redeem herself for not being by the side of her father when he was engulfed in flames and died. She provides comfort to the English Patient that she could not provide to her own father.

The rejection of a nationalistic identity enables Almásy to rationalize his duplicitous actions with his associates. He socializes with, and is a mapmaker for, the British before the war, then uses that information to smuggle German spies across northern Africa. Almásy is portrayed in a sympathetic light, partly because he tells his own story, but also because he always adheres to his own moral code.

Almásy is also at the centre of one of the novel's love stories. He is involved in an adulterous relationship with Katharine Clifton, which eventually leads to her death and the death of her husband, Geoffrey Clifton. Katharine is the figure who leads Almásy to sensuality. He falls in love with her voice as she reads [[Herodotus]]. Sensuality, both sexual and observational, is a major theme in the novel.

The character is loosely based on [[László Almásy]], a well-known desert explorer in 1930s Egypt, who helped the German side in World War II. Almásy did not suffer burns or die in Italy, but survived the war and lived until 1951.

===Hana===
Hana is a twenty-year-old Canadian Army nurse torn between her youth and her maturity. Being a good nurse, she quickly learns that she cannot become emotionally attached to her patients. She calls them all &quot;buddy,&quot;{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=51}} and forgets them immediately once they die. Her lover, a Canadian officer, is killed and because of this, Hana comes to believe that she is cursed and that all those around her are doomed to die.

In contrast, upon hearing of her father's death Hana has an emotional breakdown. She then puts all of her energy into caring for the English Patient. She washes his wounds, reads to him and provides him with morphine. When the hospital is abandoned, Hana refuses to leave, staying with her patient. She sees Almásy as saint-like and falls in love with his pure nature.{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=45}}

In addition to her relationship with Almásy, Hana also forms a strong relationship with Kip during his stay at the villa.

Hana seems to not be able to acknowledge or even come to terms with her father's death. As she almost sees no reason in returning home and her excuse to stay in the now abandoned hospital is to take proper care of the English patient, due to Almasy not being able to move because of how severe his burns are externally and internally as well. On top of this Hana fails to reply or write back her step-mother, whom she loves and is the only living family she has left. Clara writes to Hana for a year whilst she is in Italy; Hana keeps every letter, but fails to write back even with such woe and guilt filling her heart.

Hana seems to be putting off her life as a young adult and at times shows her immaturity throughout the novel. In ignoring Caravaggio's advice or suggestions or simply not facing the reality that awaits her back home. She seems as if escaping reality and being completely isolated from the rest of society is better than growing up. Hana escapes reality simply by stalling in taking care of the patient, rearranging her set up inside the defaulting villa, listening to what the Almasy has to say or the stories he tells, and by reading books to him over and over again.

Hana claims to have changed and grown up mentally throughout being a nurse during the war, as one would expect, but her &quot;growing up&quot; seems to be much more of building up a wall and being stuck in this continuous process of trying to heal an already dead body.&lt;ref&gt;Adhikari, M. &quot;History and Story: Unconventional History in Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient and James A.

===Kip===

Kirpal (Kip) [[Singh]] is an Indian [[Sikh]] who has volunteered with the British military for sapper bomb disposal training under Lord Suffolk. This act of patriotism is not shared by his [[Indian nationalist]] brother; the skepticism of his unit's white peers discourages a sense of community for Kip.

Lord Suffolk, an eccentric English nobleman, has developed techniques to dismantle complicated, unexploded bombs in what is a very dangerous occupation. Kip feels a sense of belonging in a community when he is welcomed into the Suffolk household and regards Lord Suffolk as a father figure. Lord Suffolk and his sapper team are killed while attempting to dismantle a new type of bomb. Their deaths cause Kip's emotional withdrawal to become more pronounced. [[Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk]], was a real person who did dismantle bombs and was killed while attempting to dismantle one.

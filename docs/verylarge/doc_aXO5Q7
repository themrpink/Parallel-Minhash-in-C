'''Frederick County''' is located in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 78,305.&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51069.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607061330/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51069.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[county seat]] is [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was formed in 1743 by the splitting of [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]]. It is Virginia's northernmost county.

Frederick County is included in the [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], VA-[[West Virginia|WV]] [[Winchester, VA–WV MSA|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-[[Baltimore]]-Northern Virginia, DC-[[Maryland|MD]]-VA-WV-[[Pennsylvania|PA]] [[Washington metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].

== History ==
The area that would become Frederick County, Virginia was inhabited and transited by various [[indigenous peoples]] for thousands of years before European [[colonization]]. The &quot;Indian Road&quot; refers to a historic pathway made by local [[tribe]]s.

Colonization efforts began with the [[Virginia Company of London]], but European settlement did not flourish until after the company lost its charter and Virginia became a royal colony in 1624. In order to stimulate migration to the colony, the [[headright]] system was used. Under this system, those who funded an emigrant's transportation costs (not the actual colonizers) were compensated with land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dividing the Land: Early American Beginnings of Our Private Property Mosaic|last=Price|first=Edward T.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=9780226680651|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dividinglandearl0000pric/page/91 91, 105–107]|url=https://archive.org/details/dividinglandearl0000pric/page/91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 17th century, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted several acres of colonial Virginia lands to “seven loyal supporters,” including Lord Fairfax. This passed to [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], who married the daughter of [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper|Thomas Colepeper]], who also owned several acres of land. After their son, [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Thomas Fairfax]], inherited the combined grants, he controlled over 5,000,000 acres of land in Virginia, including much of the land that became Frederick County.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/|title=About the Virginia Land Office Patents and Grants/Northern Neck Grant and Surveys|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Virginia|access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick County was created from [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] in 1738, and was officially organized in 1743.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapofus.org|title=Maps of Virginia|last=|first=|date=|website=Maps of US|access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia Assembly named the new county for [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick Louis]], [[Prince of Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|author=Gannett, Henry|publisher=Govt. Print. Off.|year=1905|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n120 131]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1707–1751), the eldest son of King [[George II of Great Britain]]. At that time, &quot;Old Frederick County&quot; encompassed all or part of four counties in present-day Virginia and five in present-day [[West Virginia]]:
* [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire]] (West Virginia), created 1754
* [[Dunmore County|Dunmore]], created 1772 and renamed [[Shenandoah County, Virginia|Shenandoah]] in 1778
* [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] (West Virginia), created 1772

=== Colonial era ===
As [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the new Colonial Virginia regiment in 1754, [[Colonel]] [[George Washington]] located his headquarters in Winchester before and during the [[George Washington in the French and Indian War|French and Indian War]]. He resigned from military service in 1758. He represented Frederick County in his first elective office, having been elected to the [[House of Burgesses]] in 1758 and 1761. 

Seventeen years later, on June 15, 1775, the Continental Congress &quot;elected&quot; George Washington as commanding general of the yet-to-be-created Continental Army. He accepted the appointment the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/amrev/contarmy/accepts.html |title=Creating a Continental Army|work=The American Revolution 1763-1783|publisher=Library of Congress|date=nd|access-date=26 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This preceded the Congress's declaration of independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.

=== War of 1812 ===

=== American Civil War ===
Winchester was a site of volatile conditions during the Civil War, with control shifting between the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] and [[Union Army|Union]] armies on average once every three weeks during the war. Many battles were fought in Frederick County. Some of those battles include:
* [[Battle of Kernstown I|First Battle of Kernstown]], March 1862
* [[First Battle of Winchester]], May 1862
* [[Battle of Winchester II|Second Battle of Winchester]], June 1863
* [[Battle of Kernstown II|Second Battle of Kernstown]], July 1864
* [[Battle of Opequon|Third Battle of Winchester (Battle of Opequon)]], September 1864
* [[Battle of Cedar Creek]], October 1864

The first constitution of [[West Virginia]] provided for Frederick County to be added to the new state if approved by a local election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/statehood/constitution.html|title=West Virginia Constitution|website=www.wvculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the residents of neighboring Berkeley and Jefferson counties, those in Frederick County voted to remain in Virginia, despite being occupied by the [[Union Army]] at the time.

==Civilian history of the area==
Four (alkaline, saline, chalybeate, and sulphured) types of [[Mineral spring|mineral water springs]] naturally occur on the land that would later be named [[Rock Enon Springs, Virginia|Rock Enon Springs]].&lt;ref name=Engelhard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engelhard|first1=G.P.|title=The Standard medical directory of North America|date=1902|pages=924}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|868}} The area was once called Capper Springs, named for area settler John Capper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peale|first1=Albert Charles|title=Lists and Analyses of the Mineral Springs of the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/listsandanalyse00pealgoog|date=1886|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=[https://archive.org/details/listsandanalyse00pealgoog/page/n239 235]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} William Marker bought the {{convert|942|acre}} in 1856 and built a hotel, the first building of the [[Rock Enon Springs, Virginia#Rock Enon Springs Resort|Rock Enon Springs Resort]]. It survived the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell Jr.|first1=Stewart|title=Rock Enon Springs Records #1303|publisher=Handley Regional Library|location=Winchester, VA, USA|url=http://www.youseemore.com/handley/contentpages.asp?loc=490|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, 1899 the Shenandoah Valley National Bank purchased the property for $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock Enon Springs Sold: Property Purchased by Bank to Protect Deed of Trust |newspaper=Washington Post|date=March 25, 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} During the summer of 1914 botanists found a variety of ferns on the property: ''polypodium vulgare,'' ''phegopteris hexagonoptera,'' ''adiantum pedatum,'' ''pteris aquilina,'' and ''cheilanthes lanosa'' on the property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fern Trips in Virginia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuttle|first1=Mary Louise|title=Fern Trips in Virginia|journal=American Fern|date=1915|volume=5|issue=4|pages=108–113|doi=10.2307/1544094|jstor=1544094}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea that soaking in the natural spring water had medical value made this and other springs popular tourist destinations through the early 20th century. &lt;ref&gt;Tourism: {{Hanging indent |{{cite book|last1=Bell Jr.|first1=Stewart|title=Rock Enon Springs Records #1303|publisher=Handley Regional Library|location=Winchester, VA, USA|url=http://www.youseemore.com/handley/contentpages.asp?loc=490|accessdate=27 February 2017}}}} {{Hanging indent |{{cite news|title=The Movements of Officials|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 24, 1888}}{{rp|2}}}} {{Hanging indent |{{cite news|title=At Rock Enon Springs Several Washingtonians Enjoy Vacations in Quiet Virginia Resort|issue=Special|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 30, 1911}}{{rp|E1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1944, people no longer had as much faith in the springs, and there was much more competition for tourists at other sites. Due to declining business, the Glaize family sold the property to the [[Shenandoah Area Council]]. They adapted the resort to operate as a Boy Scout site, [[Camp Rock Enon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot; /&gt; In 1944 the {{convert|5|acre|km2}} Miller Lake was created by adding a {{convert|200|ft|m}} earth dam across Laurel Run using equipment, owned by the Federal fish hatchery in Leestown.&lt;ref name=&quot;dam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Dam to Back Up Water For Scout Camp Lake|newspaper=Washington Post|date=Feb 27, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|M4}} In 1958 &quot;walnut, chestnut and persimmon trees&quot; were planted on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report, Volume 49|date=1958|publisher=Northern Nut Growers Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}}

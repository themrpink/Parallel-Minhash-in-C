:''Mary was hugged.''

This shift is called ''promotion'' of the object.

The passive-voice construction cannot take an object. The passivized sentence could be continued with the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]]:

:''Mary was hugged by David.''
It cannot be continued with a direct object to be taken by &quot;was hugged.&quot; For example, it would be ungrammatical to write &quot;Mary was hugged her daughter&quot; to show that Mary and her daughter shared a hug.

Intransitive verbs can be made passive in some languages. In English, intransitive verbs can be used in the passive voice when a prepositional phrase is included, as in, &quot;The houses were lived in by millions of people.&quot;

Some languages, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], have an [[impersonal passive voice]] that lets an intransitive verb without a prepositional phrase be passive. In [[German language|German]], a sentence such as &quot;The children sleep&quot; can be made passive to remove the subject and becomes, &quot;It is slept.&quot; However, no addition like &quot;...by the children&quot; is possible in such cases.

In languages with [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] [[morphosyntactic alignment|alignment]], the passive voice (where the object of a transitive verb becomes the subject of an intransitive verb) does not make sense, because the noun associated with the intransitive verb is marked as the object, not as the subject.  Instead, these often have an [[antipassive voice]].  In this context, the ''subject'' of a transitive verb is promoted to the &quot;object&quot; of the corresponding intransitive verb.  In the context of a [[nominative–accusative language]] like English, this promotion is nonsensical because intransitive verbs don't take objects, they take subjects, and so the subject of a transitive verb (&quot;I&quot; in ''I hug him'') is ''also'' the subject of the intransitive passive construction (''I was hugged by him'').  But in an ergative–absolutive language like [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], &quot;I&quot; in the transitive ''I hug him'' would take the [[ergative case]], but the &quot;I&quot; in ''I was hugged'' would take the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], and so by analogy the antipassive construction more closely resembles ''*was hugged me''.  Thus in this example, the ergative is promoted to the absolutive, and the agent (i.e., ''him''), which was formerly marked by the absolutive, is deleted to form the antipassive voice (or is marked in a different way, in the same way that in the English passive voice can still be specified as the agent of the action using ''by him'' in ''I was hugged by him''—for example, Dyirbal puts the agent in the [[dative case]], and [[Basque language|Basque]] retains the agent in the absolutive).

==Ambitransitivity==
{{Main article|Ambitransitive verb}}
In many languages, there are &quot;ambitransitive&quot; verbs, which can be either transitive or intransitive. For example, English ''play'' is ambitransitive, since it is grammatical to say ''His son plays'', and it is also grammatical to say ''His son plays guitar''. English is rather flexible as regards verb valency, and so it has a high number of ambitransitive verbs; other languages are more rigid and require explicit valency changing operations ([[grammatical voice|voice]], [[causative]] morphology, etc.) to transform a verb from intransitive to transitive or vice versa.

In some ambitransitive verbs, called ''[[ergative verb]]s'', the alignment of the syntactic arguments to the semantic roles is exchanged. An example of this is the verb ''break'' in English.

:(1) ''{{green|He}} broke {{maroon|the cup}}.''
:(2) ''{{maroon|The cup}} broke.''

In (1), the verb is transitive, and the subject is the ''agent'' of the action, i.e. the performer of the action of breaking the cup. In (2), the verb is intransitive and the subject is the ''patient'' of the action, i.e. it is the thing affected by the action, not the one that performs it. In fact, the patient is the same in both sentences, and sentence (2) is an example of implicit [[middle voice]]. This has also been termed an ''anticausative''.

Other alternating intransitive verbs in English are ''change'' and ''sink''.

In the [[Romance language]]s, these verbs are often called ''pseudo-reflexive'', because they are signaled in the same way as [[reflexive verb]]s, using the [[clitic]] particle ''se''. Compare the following (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]):

:(3a) ''La taza se rompió.'' (&quot;The cup broke.&quot;)
:(3b) ''El barco se hundió.'' (&quot;The boat sank.&quot;)
:(4a) ''Ella se miró en el espejo.'' (&quot;She looked at herself in the mirror.&quot;)
:(4b) ''El gato se lava.'' (&quot;The cat washes itself.&quot;)

Sentences (3a) and (3b) show Romance pseudo-reflexive phrases, corresponding to English alternating intransitives. As in ''The cup broke'', they are inherently without an agent; their [[deep structure]] does not and can not contain one. The action is not reflexive (as in (4a) and (4b)) because it is not performed by the subject; it just happens to it. Therefore, this is not the same as [[passive voice]], where an intransitive verb phrase appears, but there is an implicit agent (which can be made explicit using a complement phrase):

:(5) ''The cup was broken (by the child).''
:(6) ''El barco fue hundido (por piratas).'' (&quot;The boat was sunk (by pirates).&quot;)

Other ambitransitive verbs (like ''eat'') are not of the alternating type; the subject is always the agent of the action, and the object is simply optional. A few verbs are of both types at once, like ''read'': compare ''I read'', ''I read a magazine'', and ''this magazine reads easily''.

Some languages like Japanese have different forms of certain verbs to show transitivity. For example, there are two forms of the verb &quot;to start&quot;:

: (7) 会議が始まる。 (''Kaigi ga hajimaru.'' &quot;The meeting starts.&quot;)

: (8) 会長が会議を始める。 (''Kaichō ga kaigi o hajimeru.'' &quot;The president starts the meeting.&quot;)

In Japanese, the form of the verb indicates the number of arguments the sentence needs to have.&lt;ref&gt;Tsujimura, N., ed. by Natalia Gagarina and I. Gülzow (2007). The acquisition of verbs and their grammar : the effect of particular languages. Dordrecht [u.a.]: Springer. p. 106. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4336-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unaccusative and unergative verbs==
{{Main article|Unaccusative verb|Unergative verb}}
Especially in some languages, it makes sense to classify intransitive verbs as:
*''unaccusative'' when the subject is not an agent; that is, it does not actively initiate the action of the verb (e.g. &quot;die&quot;, &quot;fall&quot;).
**Unaccusative verbs are typically used to show action or movement.
***Examples:
****I '''arrived''' at the party around 8 o'clock.
****Do you know what time the plane '''departed'''?
****How did the disease '''spread''' to this town so rapidly?
****I '''sat''' on the train.
****I was in a car accident and the other person '''appeared''' out of no where. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://primus.arts.u-szeged.hu/bese/Chapter5/5.2.1.htm|title=Basic English Syntax with Exercised|last=Konzorcium|first=Bolcsesz|access-date=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''unergative'' when they have an agent subject.
**Examples:
***I am going to '''resign''' from my position at the bank.
***I have to '''run''' six miles in the morning.
***Will you '''talk''' to your child about sex before or after they are a teenager?
***The icecube tray '''froze''' solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/norvin/www/24.902/unaccusatives.html|title=Unergatives and Unaccusatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This distinction may in some cases be reflected in the grammar, where for instance different [[auxiliary verb]]s may be used for the two categories.

==Cognate objects==
{{Main article|Cognate object}}
In many languages, including English, some or all intransitive verbs can take ''cognate objects''—objects formed from the same roots as the verbs themselves; for example, the verb ''sleep'' is ordinarily intransitive, but one can say, &quot;He slept a troubled sleep&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;He slept, and his sleep was troubled.&quot;

== Other languages ==
In [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], a [[Micronesian language]], intransitive verb sentence structure is often used, with no object attached. There must be a stative or active verb to have an intransitive sentence. A stative verb has a person or an object that is directly influenced by a verb. An active verb has the direct action performed by the subject. The [[word order]] that is most commonly associated with intransitive sentences is [[subject-verb]]. However, [[verb-subject]] is used if the verb is unaccusative or by discourse pragmatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Preverbal particles in Pingelapese: A language of Micronesia - ProQuest|id = {{ProQuest|1267150306}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]], the noun phrases used with verbs are required when verbs are placed in groups. Verbs are divided into two major groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simona|first1=Ropati|title=Tokelau Dictionary|date=1986|publisher=Office of Tokelau Affairs|location=New Zealand|page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every verbal sentence must have that structure, which contains a singular noun phrase, without a preposition, called an unmarked noun phrase. Only if a ''ko''-phrase precedes the predicate, that rule may be ignored. [[Intransitive verb#cite note-6|[6]]] The agent is what speakers of the language call the person who is performing the action of the verb.[[Intransitive verb#cite note-6|[6]]] If a noun phrase that starts with the preposition ''e'' is able to express the agent, and the receiving person or thing that the agent is performing the action of the verb to is expressed by a singular noun phrase that lack a preposition, or unmarked noun phrase, the verb is then considered  transitive.[[Intransitive verb#cite note-6|[6]]] All other verbs are considered intransitive.[[Intransitive verb#cite note-6|[6]]]

[[File:Micrometers.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Outside, inside, and depth micrometers]]

A '''micrometer''', sometimes known as a '''micrometer screw gauge''', is a device incorporating a calibrated [[screw]] widely used for [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] measurement of components&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Americana (1988) &quot;Micrometer&quot; Encyclopedia Americana 19: 500 {{ISBN|0-7172-0119-8}} (set)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[machining]] as well as most mechanical trades, along with other [[Metrology|metrological]] instruments such as [[Caliper#Dial caliper|dial]], [[Caliper#Vernier caliper|vernier]], and [[Caliper#Digital caliper|digital calipers]]. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of [[caliper]]s (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.

Micrometers are also used in telescopes or microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects. The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about 1638 by [[ William Gascoigne (scientist)| William Gascoigne]], an English astronomer. &lt;ref name=&quot;SGMicrometer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a Micrometer &amp; How it Historically Develops? |publisher=SG Micrometer. |url=http://sgmicrometer.com/micrometer-historically-develops-82.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the device and its name==
[[File:Gascoigne's micrometer as drawn by Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|right|Gascoigne's Micrometer, as drawn by [[Robert Hooke]]]]
 
The word ''micrometer'' is a [[classical compound|neoclassical coinage]] {{ety|gre|micros|small||metron|measure}}. The ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|micrometer}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that English got it from French and that its first known appearance in English writing was in 1670. Neither the [[metre]] nor the [[micrometre]] (μm) nor the micrometer (device) as we know them today existed at that time. However, the people of that time did have much need for, and interest in, the ability to measure small things and small differences. The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor, even if it did not refer specifically to its present-day senses.

The first ever micrometric screw was invented by [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] in the 17th century, as an enhancement of the [[vernier scale|vernier]]; it was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects.

[[Henry Maudslay]] built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was [[wikt:jocular#Adjective|jocularly]] nicknamed &quot;the Lord Chancellor&quot; among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement [[accuracy and precision]] in the firm's work. In 1844, details of [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]]'s workshop micrometer were published.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whitworth's workshop micrometer&quot;, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's magazine, Nov 1844, pp43-44&lt;/ref&gt; This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was ''to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop''.

The first documented development of handheld micrometer-screw [[caliper]]s was by [[Jean Laurent Palmer]] of [[Paris]] in 1848;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog &lt;!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --&gt; Roe 1916:212.]&lt;/ref&gt; the device is therefore often called ''palmer'' in French, ''tornillo de Palmer'' (&quot;Palmer screw&quot;) in Spanish, and ''calibro Palmer'' (&quot;Palmer caliper&quot;) in Italian. (Those languages also use the ''micrometer'' cognates: ''micromètre, micrómetro, micrometro''.) The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by [[Brown &amp; Sharpe]] in 1867,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog &lt;!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --&gt; Roe 1916:210-213, 215.]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop. Brown &amp; Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer's design. In 1888, [[Edward W. Morley]] added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.

The culture of [[toolroom]] accuracy and precision, which started with [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability]] pioneers including [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Gribeauval]], [[Louis de Tousard|Tousard]], [[Simeon North|North]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|Hall]], [[Eli Whitney|Whitney]], and [[Samuel Colt|Colt]], and continued through leaders such as Maudslay, Palmer, [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]], Brown, Sharpe, [[Francis A. Pratt|Pratt]], [[Amos Whitney|Whitney]], [[Henry M. Leland|Leland]], and others, grew during the [[Machine Age]] to become an important part of combining [[applied science]] with [[technology]]. Beginning in the early 20th century, one could no longer truly master [[tool and die maker|tool and die making]], [[machine tool]] building, or [[engineering]] without some knowledge of the science of metrology, as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics (for [[metallurgy]], [[kinematics]]/[[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], and [[quality (business)|quality]]).

==Types==
[[File:Micrometer--large--Woodworth 1908 p204.png|thumb|upright|Large micrometer caliper]]

===Specialized types===
[[File:Machining Turning.jpg|thumb|Another large micrometer in use.]]
Each type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of [[screw thread]], in the form of a v-block, or in the form of a large disc.
* '''Universal micrometer sets''' come with interchangeable anvils, such as flat, spherical, spline, disk, blade, point, and knife-edge. The term '''universal micrometer''' may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc. (often known by the brand names Mul-T-Anvil and Uni-Mike).
* '''Blade micrometers''' have a matching set of narrow tips (blades). They allow, for example, the measuring of a narrow [[o-ring|o-ring groove]].
* '''Pitch-diameter micrometers''' (aka '''thread mics''') have a matching set of thread-shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads.
* '''Limit mics''' have two anvils and two spindles, and are used like a [[Go-NoGo gauge#Snap gauge|snap gauge]]. The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap in order to be within specification. The two gaps accurately reflect the top and bottom of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range.
* '''Bore micrometer''', typically a three-anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters.
* '''Tube micrometers''' have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes.
* '''Micrometer stops''' are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine, bedways of a lathe, or other machine tool, in place of simple stops. They help the operator to position the table or carriage precisely. Stops can also be used to actuate kickout mechanisms or limit switches to halt an automatic feed system.
* '''Ball micrometers''' have ball-shaped ([[sphere|spherical]]) anvils. They may have one flat and one ball anvil, in which case they are used for measuring tube wall thickness, distance of a hole to an edge, and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface. They differ in application from tube micrometers in that they may be used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes, but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer. Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides. The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads (which is also done [[Threading (manufacturing)#Inspection|with conical anvils or the 3-wire method]], the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair-of-balls approach).
* '''Bench micrometers''' are tools for [[inspection]] use whose [[accuracy and precision]] are around half a micrometre (20 millionths of an inch, &quot;a fifth of a tenth&quot; in machinist jargon) and whose [[repeatability]] is around a quarter micrometre (&quot;a tenth of a tenth&quot;). An example is the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt &amp; Whitney]] Supermicrometer brand.
* '''Digit mics''' are the type with mechanical digits that roll over.
* '''Digital mics''' are the type that uses an encoder to detect the distance and displays the result on a digital screen.
* '''V mics''' are outside mics with a small V-block for an anvil. They are useful for measuring the diameter of a circle from three points evenly spaced around it (versus the two points of a standard outside micrometer). An example of when this is necessary is measuring the diameter of 3-flute endmills and twist drills.

==Operating principles==

[[File:Micrometer no zero error.gif|thumb|Animation of a micrometer in use. The object being measured is in black. The measurement is 4.140{{nbsp}}±{{nbsp}}0.005{{nbsp}}mm.]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (that are too small to measure directly) into large rotations of the screw that are big enough to read from a scale. The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design. In some cases it is a [[differential screw]]. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows:
# The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw's ''[[screw thread#Lead, pitch, and starts|lead]]'' ({{IPA|/ˈliːd/}}). A screw's ''lead'' is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360[[Degree (angle)|°]]). (In most threads [that is, in all single-start threads], ''lead'' and ''pitch'' refer to essentially the same concept.)
# With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw, a given amount of axial movement will be ''amplified'' in the resulting circumferential movement.

For example, if the lead of a screw is 1&amp;nbsp;mm, but the major diameter (here, outer diameter) is 10&amp;nbsp;mm, then the circumference of the screw is 10π, or about 31.4&amp;nbsp;mm. Therefore, an axial movement of 1&amp;nbsp;mm is amplified (magnified) to a circumferential movement of 31.4&amp;nbsp;mm. This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer's thimble. In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a [[differential screw]] adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

In classic-style analog micrometers, the position of the thimble is read directly from scale markings on the thimble and sleeve (for names of parts see next section). A [[vernier scale]] is often included, which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark. In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an [[LCD]] on the instrument. There also exist mechanical-digit versions, like the style of car [[odometer]]s where [[:File:Odometer2.jpg|the numbers &quot;roll over&quot;]].

==Parts==
[[File:Micrometer caliper parts 0001.png|thumb|right|The parts of a micrometer caliper. Note the addition of a [[unit conversion]] chart etched onto the frame, useful for converting between [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[inch]] measurements and their [[decimal]] equivalents.]]

A micrometer is composed of:

; Frame: The C-shaped body that holds the anvil and barrel in constant relation to each other. It is thick because it needs to minimize flexion, expansion, and contraction, which would distort the measurement.{{paragraph}}The frame is heavy and consequently has a high thermal mass, to prevent substantial heating up by the holding hand/fingers. It is often covered by insulating plastic plates which further reduce heat transference.{{paragraph}}Explanation: if one holds the frame long enough so that it heats up by 10&amp;nbsp;°C, then the increase in length of any 10&amp;nbsp;cm linear piece of steel is of magnitude 1/100&amp;nbsp;mm. For micrometers this is their typical accuracy range.{{paragraph}}Micrometers typically have a specified temperature at which the measurement is correct (often 20&amp;nbsp;°C [68&amp;nbsp;°F], which is generally considered &quot;[[room temperature]]&quot; in a room with [[HVAC]]). [[Toolroom]]s are generally kept at 20&amp;nbsp;°C [68&amp;nbsp;°F].
; Anvil: The shiny part that the spindle moves toward, and that the sample rests against.
; Sleeve, barrel, or stock: The stationary round component with the linear scale on it, sometimes with vernier markings. In some instruments the scale is marked on a tight-fitting but movable cylindrical sleeve fitting over the internal fixed barrel. This allows zeroing to be done by slightly altering the position of the sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waitelet|first1=Ermand L.|title=Micrometer with adjustable barrel sleeve.

; Lock nut, lock-ring, or thimble lock: The knurled component (or lever) that one can tighten to hold the spindle stationary, such as when momentarily holding a measurement.
; Screw: (Not visible) The heart of the micrometer, as explained under [[#Operating principles|&quot;Operating principles&quot;]]. It is inside the barrel. This references the fact that the usual name for the device in German is ''Messschraube'', literally &quot;measuring screw&quot;.
; Spindle: The shiny cylindrical component that the thimble causes to move toward the anvil.
; Thimble: The component that one's thumb turns. Graduated markings.
; Ratchet stop: (Not illustrated) Device on end of handle that limits applied pressure by slipping at a calibrated torque.

The spindle of a micrometer graduated for the [[Imperial and US customary measurement systems]] has 40 threads per inch, so that one turn moves the spindle axially 0.025&amp;nbsp;inch (1 ÷ 40 = 0.025), equal to the distance between adjacent graduations on the sleeve. The 25 graduations on the thimble allow the 0.025&amp;nbsp;inch to be further divided, so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially 0.001&amp;nbsp;inch (0.025 ÷ 25 = 0.001). Thus, the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve, multiplied by 25 (the number of [[thousandth of an inch|thousandths of an inch]] that each division represents), plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve. The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch. As the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., appear below every fourth sub-division on the sleeve, indicating hundreds of thousandths, the reading can easily be taken.

Suppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 2, and three additional sub-divisions, were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 1 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading would then be 0.2000 + 0.075 + 0.001, or 0.276&amp;nbsp;inch.

==Publication history==
The word &quot;drow&quot; is from the [[Orcadian dialect|Orcadian]] and [[Shetland dialect|Shetland]] dialects of [[Scots language|Scots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen%3D11075%26startset%3D44442733%26query%3DTROW%26fhit%3Dtrowe%26dregion%3Dentry%26dtext%3Dsnd#fhit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526192047/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=11075&amp;startset=44442733&amp;query=TROW&amp;fhit=trowe&amp;dregion=entry&amp;dtext=snd |archivedate=2011-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative form of &quot;[[Trow (folklore)|trow]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Warrior Rising&quot; /&gt; which is a cognate with &quot;[[troll]]&quot;. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' gives no entry for &quot;drow&quot;, but two of the citations under &quot;trow&quot; name it as an alternative form of the word. Trow/drow was used to refer to a wide variety of evil sprites. Everything about the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' drow was invented by ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' co-creator [[Gary Gygax]] except for the basic concept of &quot;dark elves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027151422/http://geocities.com/rgfdfaq/sources.html Literary Sources of D&amp;D, compiled by Aardy R. DeVarque]{{better source|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Prose Edda]], [[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote about the [[Svartálfar|black elves]]: &quot;... the dark elves however live down below the ground. ... while the dark elves are blacker than pitch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krause&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Krause|first=Arnulf|title=Die wirkliche Mittelerde - Tolkiens Mythologie und ihre Wurzeln im Mittelalter (German)|publisher=Theiss|year=2012|isbn=978-3-8062-2478-8| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}

Gygax stated, &quot;Drow are mentioned in [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Keightley]]'s ''The Fairy Mythology'', as I recall (it might have been ''The Secret Commonwealth''—neither book is before me, and it is not all that important anyway), and as Dark Elves of evil nature, they served as an ideal basis for the creation of a unique new mythos designed especially for the AD&amp;D game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Books Are Books, Games Are Games&quot; in ''Dragon Magazine'', Nov. 1979, #31&lt;/ref&gt; The form &quot;drow&quot; can be found in neither work.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Gygax later stated that he took the term from a listing in the ''Funk &amp; Wagnall's Unexpurgated Dictionary'', and no other source at all. &quot;I wanted a most unusual race as the main power in the Underdark, so used the reference to 'dark elves' from the dictionary to create the Drow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/3813928-post34.html|title=Gygaxian Monsters - Page 4|website=Enworld.org|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to be no work with this title. However, the following entry can be found in abridged editions of Funk &amp; Wagnall's ''Standard Dictionary of the English Language'', such as ''The Desk Standard Dictionary of the English Language'': &quot;[Scot.] In folk-lore, one of a race of underground elves represented as skillful workers in metal.

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 1st edition===
The drow were first mentioned in the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game in the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|1st Edition]] 1977 ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' ''[[Monster Manual]]'' under the &quot;Elf&quot; entry, where it is stated that &quot;The 'Black Elves,' or drow, are only legend.&quot; No statistics are given for the drow in this book, apart from the statistics for normal elves. The drow are described as purportedly dwelling deep beneath the surface world, in strange subterranean realms. They are said to be evil, &quot;as dark as faeries are bright&quot;, and pictured in tales as poor [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighters]] but strong [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-users]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hinted in G1 ''Steading of the Hill Giant Chief'' (TSR, 1978) that there is a &quot;secret force, some motivational power behind this unusual banding of different races of giants.&quot; G2 ''The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl'' (TSR, 1978) mentions this guiding force again in its introduction. The third module in the series, G3 ''[[Against the Giants|Hall of the Fire Giant King]]'', again mentions the party's need to find out whatever is behind the giants' alliance, and this time mentions the drow specifically by name. In the adventure, the [[player character]]s can discover the first hint of drow involvement in the fire giant king's council room, on a scroll which promises &quot;powerful help from the Drow&quot;, signed by [[Eclavdra]]. Actual drow can be encountered starting on level #2 of the king's hall, beginning with a group of drow priests, and then other drow later.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3&quot;&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Hall of the Fire Giant King]]'' (TSR, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Having discovered that the drow instigated the alliance between the races of giants and its warfare against mankind, in ''D1 [[Descent into the Depths of the Earth]]'' the party follows the fleeing drow into the tunnels leading northwest and deep into the earth, to eliminate the threat they pose. Examining a golden spider pin found on one of the drow priestesses, the party can discover runes in the drow language reading &quot;[[Lolth]], Death Queen Mother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Descent into the Depths of the Earth]]'' (TSR, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The party continues to pursue the drow in D2 ''Shrine of the Kuo-Toa'', meeting the [[kuo-toa]] and the deep gnomes (also known as the [[svirfneblin]] ). As the party travels, signs of the drow are noted all around; the drow clearly freely pass through these subterranean areas, even though they are hated and feared by the other local intelligent races. The drow and kuo-toa trade with each other openly, but the kuo-toa hate and fear the drow, resulting in frequent skirmishes between the two peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Shrine of the Kuo-Toa]]'' (TSR, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''D3 [[Vault of the Drow]]'' the adventurers follow one of two subterranean passages leading out from the kuo-toan temple to come upon the Vault of the Drow, &quot;a hemispherical cyst in the crust of the earth, an incredibly huge domed fault over 6 miles long and nearly as broad.&quot; The party eventually makes it to Erelhei-Cinlu, the vast subterranean city of the drow, which is thoroughly described in the module. The characters may freely enter the city and spend time there, unless they attempt to organize any escaped slave groups for open warfare against the drow; the threat of a slave uprising will bring the chaotic drow into full cooperation. An extensive overview of the drow power structure is given for the purpose of creating any number of mini-campaigns or adventures taking place inside the drow capital. The House of Eilservs, led by Eclavdra, turned from worship of Lolth to the [[Tharizdun|Elder Elemental God]] when the city's other noble houses allied against them after proclaiming that their mistress should be the Queen of All Drow. Eilservs attempted to establish a power base through a puppet kingdom in the surface world dedicated to the worship of their new deity, so that their demands of supreme power in the Vault can no longer be denied, but this scheme was recently ruined. The characters travel on to the Egg of Lolth, where they must enter the dungeon level and fight the demoness herself. The players may discover an astral gate leading to the plane of the [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Abyss]], which sets them up for module Q1. The statistics and information for drow are reprinted from ''Hall of the Fire Giant King'' in the back of this module, along with statistics for Lolth herself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Vault of the Drow]]'' (TSR, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The story concludes in module ''Q1 [[Queen of the Demonweb Pits]]''. The astral gate from D3 leads to the Abyssal realm of Lolth, Demon Queen of Spiders, goddess of the drow elves, and architect of the sinister plot described in the two previous series of modules. Her realm, the 66th layer of the Abyss, is referred to as the [[Demonweb Pits]]. The Q1 module offers a glimpse into the Abyss itself, home to the ''D&amp;D'' race of [[Demon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demons]], where time and space stretch and twist in bizarre ways, and there are many portals that allow passage into entirely different worlds. At the very end of the module, the players face a final confrontation with Lolth, an exceptionally difficult challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[[David C. Sutherland|Sutherland III, David C]], and [[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Queen of the Demonweb Pits]]'' (TSR, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The G1-G3 modules were later published together in 1981 as a single combined module as ''G1-2-3 Against the Giants'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Against the Giants]]'' (TSR, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; and the entire series of modules in which the drow originally appeared were later published together in ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Warrior Rising&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Ed|authorlink=Ed Greenwood|title=Dark Warrior Rising: A Novel of Niflheim|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/darkwarriorrisin00gree/page/297 297]–298|chapter=Afterword|isbn=978-0-7653-1765-0|url=https://archive.org/details/darkwarriorrisin00gree|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]'' (TSR, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first hardcover ''D&amp;D'' rulebook featuring statistical information on the drow was the original ''[[Fiend Folio#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st edition|Fiend Folio]]''. Gygax wrote this entry, listed under &quot;Elf, Drow&quot;, according to the book's credits section. The text is a slightly abridged version of the text originally found in modules G3 and D3. Likewise, Lolth's description from module D3 is reprinted in the ''Fiend Folio'' under the &quot;Demon&quot; heading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Turnbull, Don]], ed. ''[[Fiend Folio#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st edition|Fiend Folio]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The drow are first presented as a [[player character]] race in ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985), also written by Gygax. Several elven sub-races are described in the book, including gray elves, wood elves, wild elves, and valley elves; the dark elves are described as the most divergent sub-race, and dark elf player characters are considered outcasts from their homeland, either by choice, differing from the standard chaotic evil alignment of the race, or having lost in some family-wide power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (TSR, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
[[Gary Gygax]]'s 1986 novel for [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; series, ''[[Artifact of Evil]]'', was the first novel to feature the drow prominently. Gygax's subsequent ''[[Gord the Rogue]]'' novels, published by New Infinities, Inc., continued the story and the drow's involvement, in the novels ''Sea of Death'' (1987), ''Come Endless Darkness'' (1988), and ''Dance of Demons'' (1988).

[[R. A. Salvatore]]'s 1988–1990 ''[[The Icewind Dale Trilogy]]'' featured the unlikely hero [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] as one of the protagonists, and the 1990–1991 followup ''[[The Dark Elf Trilogy]]'' focused on Drizzt and the drow of the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting. Salvatore continued the story of Drizzt and the drow in his subsequent series ''[[Legacy of the Drow]]'' (1992–1996), ''[[Paths of Darkness]]'' (1998–2001), and ''[[The Hunter's Blades Trilogy]]'' (2002–2004). Other works continuing the story of the drow in the Forgotten Realms include [[Elaine Cunningham]]'s ''[[Starlight and Shadows]]'' series (1995–1996, 2003), the ''[[War of the Spider Queen]]'' series (2002–2005, various authors), and [[Lisa Smedman]]'s ''[[The Lady Penitent]]'' series (2007–2008).

[[Keith Baker (game designer)|Keith Baker]]'s ''The Dreaming Dark'' trilogy (2005–2006) featured the story of the drow in Baker's world of [[Eberron]].

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 5th edition===
The drow appear as a playable elf subrace in the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' for this edition (2014). They also appear in the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' for this edition (2014). In the 5E adventure module ''Out of the Abyss'', the players are captured by the Drow at the beginning of the adventure. The drow are also discussed in the ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]'' and in the ''[[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]'' supplements, including write-ups for their pantheon updated to the 5e status-quo ([[Eilistraee]], [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Keptolo]], [[Kiaransalee]], [[Lolth]], [[Malyk]], [[Vhaeraun]], and [[Zinzerena]]).

==Description==
The drow made their first statistical appearance in ''Hall of the Fire Giant King'' in the Hellfurnace Mountains of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons World of Greyhawk campaign setting at the end of the module, and received a lengthy writeup. The history of the drow within the game is revealed; in ages past, the [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]] were torn by discord and warfare, driving out from their surface lands their selfish and cruel members, who sought safety in the [[Underdark|underworld]]. These creatures, later known as the &quot;dark elvenfolk&quot; or drow, grew strong in the arcane arts over the centuries and content with their gloomy fairyland beneath the earth, though they still bear enmity towards and seek revenge against their distant kin, the elves and faeries who drove them down. They are described as [[Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] in [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]], and highly intelligent. They are described as black-skinned and pale haired in appearance, around 5-feet tall and slight of build with somewhat sharp features, with large eyes and large pointed ears. Their equipment (magical boots and cloaks, and fine mesh armor similar to chainmail) is black in color and described as being empowered by exposure to the strange radiations of the Drow homeland, losing this power and eventually falling apart when exposed to direct sunlight and kept from the radiation for too long. Females are inherently more powerful than males, and only females may be [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]] or [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighter]]/clerics; male drow are commonly fighters, [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-users]], or both classes at once. Drow move silently and with a graceful quickness, even when wearing their armor, and blend into shadows with ease. They carry long daggers and short swords of an adamantite alloy and small one-handed crossbows which shoot darts carrying a poison that causes unconsciousness. Drow are difficult to surprise as they are able to see very well in the dark, have an intuitive sense about their underground world similar to that of [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], and can detect hidden or secret doors as easily as other elves do. Drow are highly resistant to [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|magic]], while all drow have the ability to use some inherent magical abilities even if they are not strictly spellcasters. The module also reveals that there are rumors of vast caverns housing whole cities of drow which exist somewhere deep beneath the earth, and now that the drow have dwelled in these dark labyrinthe places they dislike daylight and other forms of bright light as it hampers their abilities. They are able to communicate using a silent language composed of hand movements, and when coupled with facial and body expression, movement, and posture, this form of communication is the equal of any spoken language.&lt;ref name=&quot;G3&quot;/&gt;

The ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game's second edition product ''Monstrous Compendium Volume Two'' describes the world of the drow, where violent conflict is part of everyday life, so much so that most drow encountered are ready for a fight. Their inherent magic use comes from training in magic, which all drow receive. Not long after the creation of the elves, they were torn into rival factions, one evil and one good; after a great civil war, those who followed the path of evil and chaos were driven far from the world's forests and into the bleak, lightless caverns and tunnels of the underworld. Most creatures who live on the surface have never met a drow, but those who have seen a drow city report nightmarish buildings constructed of stone and minerals, carved into weird, fantastic shapes. Drow society is fragmented into opposing noble houses and merchant families, and they base their rigid class system on the belief that the strongest should rule. Female drow tend to fill many positions of great importance, with priests of the dark goddess Lolth holding a very high place in society. Drow fighters are required to go through rigorous training in their youth, and those who fail are put to death. Drow use giant lizards as pack animals, use bugbears and troglodytes as servants, and have alliances with many of the underworld's evil inhabitants such as [[illithid|mind flayers]]. Drow constantly war with other underground neighbors such as dwarves and dark gnomes (svirfneblin), and keep slaves of all types - including allies who fail to live up to drow expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC2&quot;/&gt; ''The Complete Book of Elves'' by [[Colin McComb]] focuses some of its attention on the drow. The ''Elfwar'' is presented, an elven myth in which the elves were one people until the Spider Queen Lolth used the dissent among the elves to gain a foothold; the elves of Lolth took the name Drow to signify their new allegiance, but as they massed to conquer the other elves, [[Corellon Larethian]] and his followers drove Lolth and her people deep into the earth, where they chose to remain. The dark elves who became the drow were originally simply elves who held more with the tenets of might than those of justice, and as they quested for power they became corrupted and turned against their fairer brethren. Dark elves rarely produce [[Half-elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|half-elves]], as they would slaughter any fool who trusts them. Drow infravision is described as so intense that their eyes actually radiate heat; therefore, a character viewing a drow through infravision would see two burning eyes atop a normally glowing torso. Any elf character of good or neutral alignment, even drow, is allowed into the realm of Arvanaith where elves go upon reaching old age. The book notes that drow [[player character]]s have a large number of benefits while suffering few disadvantages, but that &quot;the major disadvantage to being a drow ''is'' being a drow.&quot; Drow characters are extraordinarily dexterous and intelligent, but have the typically low elf constitution; also, their personalities are described as grating at best, and all other elves ''hate'' the drow which affects their reactions to a drow character.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBoE&quot;/&gt;

===Forgotten Realms===
1991's ''[[Drow of the Underdark#Second edition|The Drow of the Underdark]]'', a 128-page sourcebook all about the drow, expanded the drow significantly for the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons second edition version of the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting. The first chapter explains &quot;The Nature of Dark Elves&quot;, augmenting the information in the ''Monstrous Compendium'' entry. It describes their variable physical builds, their alert and inquisitive intelligence, their highly developed senses, the personal magic that all drow are trained in; it also details drow wizards (the most dangerous drow likely to be encountered outside the Underdark), as well as the driders, misfit drow who have failed a test of Lolth. ''Dark Elven Society'' is detailed in the second chapter. Drow society, being strongly matriarchal, allows the females to hold all positions of power in the government, and to choose and discard mates freely. Social station is the most important thing in drow society, making ascension to greater power a drow's ultimate goal. Drow have a strong affinity for arachnids, as most worship the spider goddess Lolth, and spiders dwell freely among drow communities. The third chapter details &quot;Drow Religion&quot; in the Forgotten Realms setting; as the majority of drow worship Lolth (or &quot;Lloth&quot;, formerly known as Araushnee in ancient times), they simply don't speak of or recognize those who do not. Drow deities in this world include [[Eilistraee]], the &quot;Dark Maiden&quot;, the goddess of good-aligned drow, and of song, dance, swordwork, and hunting; [[Ghaunadaur]], That Which Lurks (also known as &quot;The Elder Elemental Eye&quot;), a tentacled dark purple blob served by [[Roper (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ropers]] and patron of [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|oozes]] and all things subterranean; Lolth; and [[Vhaeraun]], the god of thievery and the patron god of drow males in opposition to the matriarchy of drow society. &quot;The High History of the Drow&quot; in the Realms is revealed in the fourth chapter, detailing the descent of the Ilythiiri (the original &quot;Dark Elves&quot;) of the southern jungles into the underground, and their dark wars as they became the drow they are today. The fifth chapter details 27 new &quot;Drow [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Spells]]&quot; for both wizards and priests; the sixth chapter includes dozens of &quot;Drow [[Magic item (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Magical Items]]&quot;, some of which previously appeared in first edition ''AD&amp;D'' sources; the seventh chapter details &quot;Drow Craftwork&quot;, discussing their unique clothing and weaponry, their poison, as well as mining and engineering, and drow artisans. The eighth chapter briefly describes &quot;Drow Language&quot;, while the ninth chapter goes into &quot;Drow Nomenclature&quot; by providing example female and male given names and drow house names, and the tenth chapter provides &quot;A Selected Glossary of Deep Drow&quot;. &quot;Dark Elven Symbols&quot; are described in the eleventh chapter, including drow runes such as way-marker runes, sacred glyphs, house defense glyphs; the twelfth chapter, &quot;The Spider and the Axe: War in the Depths&quot; details an &quot;ideal longterm campaign setting&quot; involving a war between drow and [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]]; the thirteenth chapter provides a brief look at &quot;The Underdark&quot;, but advises readers to see the ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]'' series and the ''[[Dwarves Deep]]'' sourcebook for further information. The fourteenth chapter provides game statistics for several &quot;Monsters of the Underdark&quot; that associate with drow, or compete with them, including the [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|deep dragon]], the [[myrlochar]], the [[Rothé|deep rothe]], the [[yochlol]], and several species of spider and spider-like creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;DotU2E&quot;/&gt; According to ''The Complete Book of Elves'', drow are not welcome in [[Evermeet]] and are turned away.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBoE&quot;/&gt;

With the ability to resist magic and powerful [[darkvision (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|darkvision]], drow are more powerful than many of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''{{'}}s races.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF16intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=F. Wesley|first2=James|last2=Jacobs|authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|title=Pathfinder #16: Endless Night|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing]]|location=[[Bellevue, Washington]], [[United States]]|year=2008|series=Pathfinder Adventure Path|pages=4–5|chapter=Foreword: To Serve the Matron|isbn=978-1-60125-129-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drow are naturally resistant to magic. They also possess darkvision superior to most other supernatural races.

Drow possess natural magical abilities which enables them to summon globes of darkness, outline targets in faerie fire which causes no harm but makes the target brightly visible to everyone who sees them, and create magical balls of light. They can also levitate for short periods of time. Female Drow are naturally inclined to priestly magic, and males are naturally inclined towards arcane magic.

Like other elves, Drow are more dexterous than humans, but have a weaker constitution. They live to extraordinarily long ages if not killed by violence first, over a thousand years in some cases. Their hearing and vision are better than that of a human being and they are difficult to sneak up on because of this. They also naturally excel at moving silently.

However, ruleswise the Drow from the ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition setting do not seem to possess some of the natural abilities of [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|surface elves]], despite being of a common stock. Included among them are their immunity to Ghoul paralysis; natural resistance to ''sleep'' and ''charm'' magic; and the surface elves' natural bonuses for swords and bow. Beginning in the ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' and continued in subsequent publications, corresponding stats were not established for Drow, and no explanation for their absence offered.

==Reception==
The drow originally created by [[Gary Gygax]] are now &quot;essentially the drow of fantasy fiction today&quot;, according to [[Ed Greenwood]], who believes them to be &quot;arguably Gary Gygax's greatest, most influential fantasy creation&quot; after the D&amp;D game itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Warrior Rising&quot; /&gt; Designer [[James Jacobs (game designer)|James Jacobs]] considers the drow to be a rare example of a D&amp;D-invented monster becoming mainstream, with even non-gamers recognizing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF13intro&quot; /&gt;

Drow have been proven to draw additional sales of products which feature them. While [[Paizo Publishing]] was printing ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' and ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'', covers featuring drow often sold better than other issues in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF13intro&quot; /&gt;

The drow, especially when used as [[player character]]s, are surrounded by much controversy,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} especially after the release of [[R. A. Salvatore]]'s novel, ''[[The Crystal Shard]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF13intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Greg A.|first2=James|last2=Jacobs|authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|title=Pathfinder #13: Shadow in the Sky|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing]]|location=[[Bellevue, Washington]], [[United States]]|year=2008|series=Pathfinder Adventure Path|pages=4–5|chapter=Foreword: ...And I Feel Fine|isbn=978-1-60125-115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[James Jacobs (game designer)|James Jacobs]] has said that the drow player characters often spark arguments, with some players refusing to play in a campaign that allows drow PCs. Jacobs says that &quot;even the name&quot; is controversial, having at least two pronunciations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PF13intro&quot; /&gt;

Rob Bricken from [[io9]] named the drow as the 8th most memorable D&amp;D monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-10-most-memorable-dungeons-dragons-monsters-1326074030/|title=The 10 Most Memorable Dungeons &amp; Dragons Monsters|work=io9|last=Bricken|first=Rob|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===Environment===
Within the context of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game, the drow were forced underground in what is now known as the [[Underdark]] after the great war amongst the elves, a vast system of caverns and tunnels spanning much of the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Races&quot;&gt;Eric L. Boyd, Matt Forbeck and James Jacobs — ''Races of Faerûn''; [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2003 {{ISBN|0-7869-2875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost&quot;&gt;Richard Baker, Ed Bonny, Travis Stout — ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn (accessory)|Lost Empires of Faerûn]]''; [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2005 {{ISBN|0-7869-3654-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drow live in city-states in the Underdark,&lt;ref name=&quot;Underdark&quot; /&gt; becoming one of the most powerful races therein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underdark&quot; /&gt;

The drow are well adapted to seeing in the dark, and they loathe, are terrified of, and are easily blinded by the light of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM4&quot; /&gt; Some magic weapons, armor, and various other items of the drow disintegrate on contact with sunlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underdark&quot; /&gt;

===Typical physical characteristics===
Drow characters are extremely intelligent, charismatic and dexterous, but share surface elves' comparative frailty and slight frames. Females tend to be bigger and stronger than males.&lt;ref name=&quot;DotU2E&quot;/&gt; Drow are characterized by white or silver hair and [[obsidian]] black skin. Their eyes are red (or rarely gray, violet, or yellow) in darkness and can be many different colors in normal light.&lt;ref&gt;From the book ''Homeland'' by [[R.A. Salvatore]].&lt;/ref&gt; Drow have several kinds of innate spell powers and spell resistance. This is balanced by their weakness in daylight. Also, drow [[weapons]] and [[armor]] (usually made of [[adamant]]ite or another metal unique to the [[Underdark]]) slowly lose their [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties if exposed to the [[sun]]. In ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' second edition, adamantite disintegrates upon exposure to sunlight unless specifically treated. Drow also employ the unusual hand [[crossbow]], firing small, though very lethal, darts. Half-drow are the result of crossbreeding between another race and a drow, and share characteristics of both. (The term &quot;half-drow&quot; usually refers to one who is half drow and half human.) Half-drow are also generally evil; however, half-drow of differing alignments are more common than non-evil full drow.

Drow males are commonly [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizards]] or [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighters]]. Females are almost always [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]] and almost never wizards.

===Alignment===
As a race, drow are usually [[alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|evil]]. Exceptions exist, the most notable being [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], [[Jarlaxle|Jarlaxle Baenre]], and [[Liriel Baenre]], but these are highly unusual. (Note that even Liriel Baenre was arguably of evil alignment for the first portion of her life, only shifting to a good alignment after close relationships with several good-aligned characters.) Originally, drow were chaotic evil in alignment.  Beginning with 3rd edition D&amp;D, drow are usually neutral evil.  There have been encounters with non-evil drow, but these are distrusted as much as their brethren, due to their reputation. The Drow followers of [[Eilistraee]] are the largest group of good Drow, as Eilistraee is the patron goddess of all Drow that have a good alignment.

==Society==
{{One source|section|date=August 2018}}
Drow society is primarily [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], with priestesses of their evil spider goddess [[Lolth]] (sometimes spelled ''Lloth'') in the highest seats of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Warrior Rising&quot; /&gt; However, in the original world of Greyhawk campaign setting created by Gary Gygax, Drow rank structure was based much more on personal experience level and proven personal abilities rather than on gender. Males were just as likely to have positions of authority over both males and females, and the tradition of Matriarchy, where the highest-ranking member was always a female, was not a special directive of the Demon Queen Lolth. The vast majority of Drow Elves both male and female in the original campaign setting of Greyhawk have no authority or ranking at all and live an idle and degenerate life in the great city of the Drow.

Drow society is based upon violence, murder, cunning, and the philosophy that only the strong survive (though in Drow tongue, a quirk of the language creates a reversal of cause-and-effect; more correctly, it can be translated as &quot;those who survive are strong&quot;).  Hence, most Drow plot endlessly to murder or otherwise incapacitate their rivals and enemy Drow using deceit and betrayal.  Drow, particularly in higher positions, are constantly wary of assassins and the like.  One of the quirks of this constant infighting is the relatively short lifespan of the average Drow. While being just as long lived as their surface cousins, living as long as a thousand years, elderly Drow are rarely encountered. Consequently, they are the only race of Elves that matches the fertility of 'lesser' races, such as humans. Their society, as a whole, is seemingly nonviable.  The only reason they do not murder themselves to extinction is by the will of Lolth, working primarily through her clergy.  Lolth does not tolerate any Drow that threaten to bring down her society, and the clergy make certain that perpetrators cease their destructive actions by either threatening or killing them.

There are exceptions to the rule, of course.  Some communities of drow worship other gods (like [[Vhaeraun]] or [[Eilistraee]]), and thus, their hierarchy changes, reverses the roles of males and females, or (such as in the case of Eilastree) even approaching something like a workable, progressive society.

Most drow societies hate surface elves, but will wage war with almost any surface race and other subterranean races, such as [[Illithid|mind flayers]], [[svirfneblin]], [[Duergar (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|duergar]], [[kuo-toa]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], and orcs, for spoils and territory.

==In various campaign settings==

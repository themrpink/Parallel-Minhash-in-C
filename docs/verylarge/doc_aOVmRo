After the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1917, the new [[Russian Provisional Government]] in [[Petrograd]] had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or ''soviet'') in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=47}} He did not join the [[Bolshevik]]s until 1918, a year in which the [[Russian Civil War]], between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the [[White Movement|White Army]], began in earnest. His biographer, [[William Taubman]], suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the [[Menshevik]]s who prioritised economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47–48}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47–48}}

In March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|a separate peace]] with the [[Central Powers]], [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|the Germans occupied the Donbas]] and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the [[Red Army]] as a [[political commissar]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=48–49}} The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=12}} though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilised and assigned as commissar to a labour brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}

The wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of [[typhus]] in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|Bolshevik principles]], refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}

== Party official ==
=== Donbas years ===
Through the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=54–55}}

[[File:NikitaNina.JPG|thumb|Khrushchev's second wife (though they were never officially married) was Ukrainian-born [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], whom he met in 1922]]
Khrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to [[Donetsk National Technical University|the newly established technical college]] (''tekhnikum'') in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (''[[rabfak]]'') attached to the ''tekhnikum'' that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the ''tekhnikum''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} While enrolled in the ''rabfak'', Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=14}} One of his teachers later described him as a poor student.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} He was more successful in advancing in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]; soon after his admission to the ''rabfak'' in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire ''tekhnikum'', and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of [[Leon Trotsky]] against those of [[Joseph Stalin]] over the question of party democracy.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56–57}} All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his ''rabfak'' studies, it is unclear whether this was true.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56–57}}

Khrushchev's studies were aided by [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants, according to some sources.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=58–59}} The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.

In mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky ''[[raikom]]'', or district, near Stalino. The ''raikom'' was about {{convert|400|sqmi|km2}} in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=16–17}} In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party]] in Moscow.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=63}}

=== Kaganovich protégé ===
[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[NKVD]] chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]], 1935. Khrushchev is left behind Yagoda.]]
Khrushchev met [[Lazar Kaganovich]] as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64–66}} and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of the Stalino party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64–66}} Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to [[Kharkov]], then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=66}} In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to [[Kyiv]], where he served as second-in-command of the Party organization there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=68}}

In 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the [[Kremlin]] as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the [[Industrial Academy (Moscow)|Stalin Industrial Academy]]. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31–32}} Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and, afterward, purging the cell of the rightists.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31–32}} Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow city Party organization]], and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party's Central Committee]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=78}} Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=33–34}}

While head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended construction of the [[Moscow Metro]], a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the [[Order of Lenin]] for his role in its construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=94–95}} Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the [[Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow Regional Committee]] which was responsible for [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow ''oblast'']], a province with a population of 11&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}}

=== Involvement in purges ===
[[File:Khrushchyov, Beria and Khanjian.jpg|thumb| [[Nestor Lakoba]], Khrushchev, [[Lavrenti Beria]] and [[Aghasi Khanjian]] during opening of the [[Moscow Metro]] in 1936.]]
Stalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's ''dacha'', while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=105–06}}
[[File:Вручение орденов ЦИК СССР.jpg|thumb|right|Khrushchev (sitting first from left), head of Moscow party branch, with various regional party leaders in 1935. Standing first from right is [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]]]]
Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the [[Great Purge]], during which millions of people were executed or sent to the [[Gulag]]. Central to this campaign were the [[Moscow Trials]], a series of [[show trial]]s of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-[[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinovievite]] gang. That word is execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=98}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Khrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow ''oblast''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} Of 38&amp;nbsp;top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}}—the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=57}} Of the 146&amp;nbsp;Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=99–100}} By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}

Party leaders were given numerical quotas of &quot;enemies&quot; to be turned in and arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}} In June 1937, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] set a quota of 35,000&amp;nbsp;enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000&amp;nbsp;wealthy peasants, or ''[[kulak]]s'' living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305&amp;nbsp;&quot;criminal and ''kulak'' elements&quot; had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}

Khrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, &quot;blanched&quot; (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=103–04}} Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an [[enemy of the people]] then and there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=104}} Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=69}}
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhDPL92SOY Khrushchev speech in 1937]}}
In late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party in Ukraine]], and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kyiv, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=114–15}} Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=116}} All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=60}}

Biographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kyiv, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying &quot;Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers.&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}}

== World War II ==
=== Occupation of Polish territory ===
When Soviet troops, pursuant to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded the eastern portion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the [[Western Ukraine|western portion of Ukraine]]. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|USSR Supreme Soviet]], and Western Ukraine became a part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Ukrainian SSR) on 1 November 1939.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=135–37}} Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with [[Eastern Ukraine|Eastern Ukrainians]], and giving confiscated land to collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]es'') rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=72}}

=== War against Germany ===
When [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the USSR]], in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kyiv.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=149}} Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=150}} As the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military in an attempt to defend and save Kyiv. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon [[Battle of Kyiv (1941)|encircled by the Germans]]. While the Germans stated they took 655,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541&amp;nbsp;men out of 677,085 escaped the trap.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=163}} Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point. According to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Georgi Zhukov]], writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kyiv.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=162–64}} However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]] proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|p=347}} Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:

{{quote|But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished&amp;nbsp;... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy.&amp;nbsp;... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them.&amp;nbsp;... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|pp=349–50}}}}

In 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the [[Kharkov]] area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000&amp;nbsp;Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to [[Second Battle of Kharkov|attack at Kharkov]], and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers, including more than 200,000&amp;nbsp;men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to [[Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=164–68}}

[[File:RIAN archive 882837 The defenders of Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|left|Khrushchev (left) on the Stalingrad Front]]
Khrushchev reached the [[Stalingrad Front]] in August 1942, soon after the start of [[Battle of Stalingrad|the battle for the city]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168–71}} His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General [[Vasily Chuikov]], who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=81}} Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a [[counterattack]], only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned [[Operation Uranus]], a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before ''Uranus'' was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168–71}}

Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son [[Leonid Khrushchev|Leonid]], a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,{{sfn|Birch|2008}} as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life.{{sfn|Birch|2008}} This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech.{{sfn|Birch|2008}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=157–58}} While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=82}} In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=158}} In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=158–62}}

After ''Uranus'' forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served in other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the [[Battle of Kursk]], in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=171–72}} Khrushchev related that he interrogated an [[SS]] defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as &quot;almost certainly exaggerated&quot;.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177–78}} He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kyiv in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177–78}} As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=81–82}}

According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era were generally favorable, at a time when it was &quot;barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context&quot;.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}} Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}}

== Rise to power ==
=== Return to Ukraine ===
Almost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=179}}

Khrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine, but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=180}} As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000&amp;nbsp;men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=193–95}} Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}}

In an effort to increase agricultural production, the ''[[kolkhoz]]es'' (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. ''Kolkhoz'' leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000&amp;nbsp;people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} He also worked to impose [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=87–88}} The partisans, many of whom fought as the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 &quot;bandits&quot; and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}} About 600,000&amp;nbsp;Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}}

The war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} The [[Soviet government]] sought to collect as much grain as possible to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=199}} Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=199–200}} Food was rationed—but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions, and was little noticed outside the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free [[soup kitchen]]s.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=200–201}} However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to &quot;help&quot; Khrushchev.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=92}} The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}}

Soon after Kaganovich arrived in Kyiv, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}} However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in [[Latvia]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}} Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet [[Kaliningrad]], where he toured factories and quarries.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=27}} By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favour of [[Demyan Korotchenko]], Khrushchev's protégé.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}}

Khrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=95}} Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=205}} Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=96}} With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a &quot;rural proletariat&quot;, Khrushchev conceived the idea of the &quot;agro-town&quot;.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96–97}} Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96–97}}

In his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction&amp;nbsp;... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts&amp;nbsp;... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=16–17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Stalin's final years ===
Khrushchev attributed his recall to Moscow to mental disorder on the part of [[Stalin]], who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated [[Leningrad case]], in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=18–22}} Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of [[Georgy Malenkov]] and security chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=210}}

At this time, the ageing leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin. These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and [[Nikolai Bulganin]], who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favoured by Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211–15}} Stolen from the West, they lacked subtitles.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211–15}} The dictator had the meal served at around 1&amp;nbsp;am, and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance [[hopak|a traditional Ukrainian dance]]. Khrushchev did so, later stating, &quot;When Stalin says dance, a wise man dances.&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211–15}} Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, &quot;Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.&quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=43}}

In 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. A large part of the housing was in the form of five- or six-story apartment buildings, which became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=99}} Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=226}} These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946 to 1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed ''[[Khrushchyovka]]'' by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called ''Khrushchoba'', combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word ''trushchoba'', meaning &quot;slum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vocabulary of Soviet Society and Culture: A Selected Guide to Russian Words, Idioms, and Expressions of the Post-Stalin Era, 1953–1991 |author=Irina H. Corten |page=[https://archive.org/details/vocabularyofsovi00cort/page/64 64] |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8223-1213-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/vocabularyofsovi00cort/page/64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, almost 60,000,000&amp;nbsp;residents of the former Soviet Union still lived in these buildings.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=99}}

In his new positions, Khrushchev continued his ''kolkhoz'' consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=100–01}} Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in ''[[Pravda]]'' in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=228–30}}

On 1 March 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders not to be disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=236–41}}

Khrushchev reflected on Stalin in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an &quot;enemy of the people.&quot; He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, &quot;the enemies of the people&quot; had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal&amp;nbsp;... &lt;nowiki&gt;[P]&lt;/nowiki&gt;eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never!&amp;nbsp;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=167–68}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Struggle for control ===
On 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|first vice-chairmen]]. [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin#Funeral service|Stalin's funeral]] was conducted on 9 March. Those members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee]] who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=114}} ''The New York Times'' listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1953-03-10}}

However, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee on 14 March.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614785/Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics &quot;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot;] at ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=258}}

After Stalin's death, Beria launched a number of reforms. According to Khrushchev biographer [[William Taubman]], &quot;unparalleled in his cynicism, he [Beria] didn't let ideology stand in his way. Had he prevailed, he would almost certainly have exterminated his colleagues, if only to prevent them from liquidating him. In the meantime, however, his burst of reforms rivaled Khrushchev's and in some ways even Gorbachev's thirty five years later.&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million non-political prisoners.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=246}} Another, which was not adopted, was to release [[East Germany]] into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=247}}—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=184}} Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=121}} and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that &quot;Beria is getting his knives ready for us.&quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=186}} The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy K.  Blauvelt, &quot;Patronage and betrayal in the post-Stalin succession: The case of Kruglov and Serov&quot; ''Communist &amp; Post-Communist Studies'' (2008) 43#1 pp 105–20.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret, and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates. The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=123}}

The power struggle in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=125–26}} Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}}

Khrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}} Khrushchev arranged for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] grounds to be opened to the public, an act with &quot;great public resonance&quot;.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=263}} While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader, and included the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]], under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern [[Kazakhstan]]. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=174}} In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the [[Leningrad affair|Leningrad case]], they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the [[KGB]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=260–264}}

At a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial [[Supreme Soviet]] the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favour of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=15–17}} Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, &quot;Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the [[collective leadership]] was now beyond any reasonable doubt.&quot;{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=141–42}}

The post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign-policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by the European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's &quot;secret speech&quot; attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts, and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality—he remained unpredictable, and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik, but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marantz, &quot;Internal Politics and Soviet Foreign Policy: A Case Study.&quot; ''Western Political Quarterly'' 28.1 (1975): 130–46.

{{main|Secret Speech}}
After the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=266}} However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=266–67}} The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=27}} Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=268–69}}

By the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the [[Gulag]] labor camps.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=275}} Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=276}} Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279–80}}

The 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the Communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with [[Klement Gottwald]] and the little-known [[Kyuichi Tokuda]].{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=153}} In the early morning hours of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the &quot;[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot; to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the &quot;congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.&quot;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=212}} Khrushchev told the delegates:

=== Economic measures ===
Knack and Keefer (1996) measured [[Econometrics|econometric]] correlations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, with [[economic growth]] in a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in less [[Social polarization|polarized]] societies in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger.

Narayan and Pritchet (1997) researched the [[associativity]] degree and economic performance in rural homes of [[Tanzania]]. They observed that even in [[Poverty index|high poverty indexes]], families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level.

=== Group membership-based ===
In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such as [[political parties]]) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant.  While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done by [[Yankee City]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Lloyd Warner, J.O. Low, Paul S. Lunt, &amp; Leo Srole (1963). ''Yankee City''.  New Haven, CT: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups.

How a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] is an example of this kind of organizations.

=== Social behaviour-based ===
Foschi and Lauriola have presented a measure of [[sociability]] as a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement and [[political participation]], as predictors of social capital, in a [[Holism|holistic]] model of [[political behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foschi | first1 = R. | last2 = Lauriola | first2 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Does sociability predict civic involvement and political participation? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 339–357 | doi=10.1037/a0035331| pmid = 24467426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Social Capital Monitor]] is an instrument for measuring [[social goods]] and social capital created by the [[United Nations Sustainable Development Group]] in partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such as [[Trust (social science)|trust]], [[solidarity]], [[helpfulness]], [[friendliness]], [[hospitality]] and the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymous [[Survey sampling|surveys]]. The surveys started in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=11706#updates|title=World Social Capital Monitor - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrating history and socio-economic analysis ==

=== Beyond Putnam ===
While influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work of [[Robert D. Putnam]]. This includes:
* the lack of awareness of the structural socio-economic conditions of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skocpol | first1 = T | year = 1996 | title = Unravelling from Above | journal = The American Prospect | volume = 25 | pages = 20–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skocpol | first1 = T. | last2 = Ganz | first2 = M. | last3 = Munson | first3 = Z. | year = 2000 | title = A Nation of Organisers: The institutional Origins of Civic Voluntarism in the United States | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12641806| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 94 | issue = 3| pages = 527–46 | doi=10.2307/2585829| jstor = 2585829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = I.T. | year = 2005 | title = The Theory that Won't Die: From Mass Society to the Decline of Social Capital | journal = Sociological Forum | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 421–48 | doi=10.1007/s11206-005-6596-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the level of income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knack | first1 = S. | last2 = Keefer | first2 = P. | year = 1997 | title = Does Social Capital Have an Economic Pay-Off ?

* the excessive [[determinism]] of the [[historical analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lupo|first1=S|year=1993|title=Usi e Abusi del Passato. Le Radici dell'Italia di Putnam|journal=Meridiana|volume=18|pages=151–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemann|first1=N|year=1996|title=Kicking in Groups|journal=Atlantic Monthly|volume=277|pages=22–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarrow|first1=S|year=1996|title=Making Social Science Work across Space and Time: A Critical Reflection on Robert Putnam's Making Democracy Work|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=90|issue=2|pages=389–97|doi=10.2307/2082892|jstor=2082892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Putnam's social capital index does not consider [[Race (human categorization)|racial diversity]] which links to worse outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Racial Diversity and Social Capital: Equality and Community in America|last = Hero|first = Rodney|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-521-69861-0|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/racialdiversitys0000hero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does Putnam consider [[ethnic diversity]], which often creates barriers to [[cooperation]] and [[democratization]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowley, Kathleen M., and Brian D. Silver. 2002. &quot;Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States.&quot; ''[[Europe-Asia Studies]]'' 54(4):505–27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the conflation of social capital with [[civil society]], the lack of empirical evidence connecting social capital's promotion of economic growth and substantiating the decline of social capital in the United States in the last 35 years, and the assumption that social networks produce win-win relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeFilippis|first=James|date=2001-01-01|title=The myth of social capital in community development|journal=Housing Policy Debate|volume=12|issue=4|pages=781–806|doi=10.1080/10511482.2001.9521429|issn=1051-1482|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b30eeab18a70790e2ca300ade3bb407b0aa7d83a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social capital motives ===
Robison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robison|first1=Lindon J.|last2=Shupp|first2=Robert S.|last3=Jin|first3=Songqing|last4=Siles|first4=Marcelo E.|last5=Ferrarini|first5=Tawni H.|year=2012|title=The relative importance of selfishness and social capital motives|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=41|pages=118–127|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''selfishness motive''' assumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as the ''selfishness of preference assumption'' in [[neoclassical economics]].

'''Social capital motives''' assume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging:&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

# The first social capital motive seeks for validation by acting consistently with the values of one's [[ideal self]].
# The second social capital motive seeks to be validated by others by winning their [[Social approval|approval]].
# The third social capital motive seeks to [[Belongingness|belong]]. Recognizing that one may not be able to influence the sympathy of others, persons seeking to belong may act to increase their own sympathy for others and the organizations or institutions they represent.
# The fourth social capital motive recognizes that our sympathy or social capital for another person will motivate us to act in their interest. In doing so we satisfy our own needs for validation and belonging. Empirical results reject the hypothesis often implied in economics that we are 95% selfish.

== Relation with civil society ==
Various authors give definitions of ''[[civil society]]'' that refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessandrini 2002&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox in Alessandrini (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt in Alessandrini (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walzer (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is very close to that of the ''third sector'', which consists of &quot;private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

According to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002),&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessandrini 2002&quot; /&gt; Newtown, Stolle &amp; Rochon, Foley &amp; Edwards (1997),&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 1997&quot; /&gt; and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, the ''third sector'', that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. These [[Voluntary association|voluntary associations]] also connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is &quot;this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society&quot; that constitutes the sources of social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessandrini 2002&quot; /&gt;

Not only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons' ''Third Sector'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Sector| year=2001| last=Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt; social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community.&lt;ref&gt;Onyx (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into &quot;the community.&quot; However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary.

Foley and Edwards (1997) believe that &quot;political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 1997&quot; /&gt; Alessandrini agrees, saying that, &quot;in Australia in particular, [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] has been recast as [[economic rationalism]] and identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessandrini 2002&quot; /&gt;

The resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In [[international development]], [[Ben Fine]] (2001) and [[John Harriss]] (2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Fine|Fine, Ben]]. 2001. ''Social Capital versus Social Theory: Political Economy and Social Science at the Turn of the Millennium''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-24179-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Harriss|Harriss, John]]. 2001. ''Depoliticizing Development: The World Bank and Social Capital''. [[LeftWord Books|Leftword]] / Anthem / Stylus.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.
An abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modern [[liberal democracy]]. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little.

=== Sample societies ===
'''Post-Communist''': Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled &quot;Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States&quot;, in which they find that in [[Post-communist countries|post-communist states]], higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 826422|title = Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States|journal = Europe-Asia Studies|volume = 54|issue = 4|pages = 505–527|last1 = Dowley|first1 = Kathleen M.|last2 = Silver|first2 = Brian D.|year = 2002|doi = 10.1080/09668130220139145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third-world''': A number of intellectuals in [[Developing country|developing countries]] have argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-driven [[imperialism]] and that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition.&lt;ref&gt;see Moore, David, ed. 2007. ''The World Bank''. [[University of KwaZulu-Natal Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese''': The concept of social capital in a Chinese [[social context]] has been closely linked with the concept of ''[[guanxi]]''.

'''American''': One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=corporatealliance.net|url=http://www.corporatealliance.net|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=corporatealliance.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=xentrum.org|url=http://www.xentrum.org|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=xentrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camara Latinoamericana &gt; Home|url=http://www.camaralatinoamericana.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128191333/http://camaralatinoamericana.com/|archive-date=28 January 2011|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such as [[LinkedIn]], these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of the ''number'' of their relationships, meetings designed to boost the ''strength'' of each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles of ''influential'' people.

== Effects on women's engagement with politics ==
{{See also|Sex differences in social capital}}

There are many factors that drive volume towards the [[ballot box]], including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and men [[voter turnout]] is diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harell 2009&quot;&gt;Harell, A. 2009. ''Equal Participation but Separate Paths?: Women's Social Capital and Turnout''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc.

There are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are:
* Women's informal and formal networks tend toward care work that is often considered apolitical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliasoph 1998&quot;&gt;Eliasoph, N. 1998. ''Avoiding Politics''. Cambridge, UK: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women are also more likely to engage in local politics and social movement activities than in traditional forums focused on national politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers 1997&quot;&gt;Vickers, J. 1997. ''Reinventing Political Science: A Feminist Approach.'' Halifax: Fernwood.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women are more likely to organize themselves in less hierarchical ways and to focus on creating consensus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliasoph 1998&quot; /&gt;

The often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicize [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] environments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harell 2009&quot; /&gt;

== Effects on health ==
A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin 2001&quot;&gt;Lin, N. &quot;Building a network theory of social capital.&quot; Pp. 3–29 in ''Social capital: Theory and Research'', edited by N. Lin, K. Cook, &amp; R .S. Burt. New York: [[Aldine de Gruyter]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive information, money, or moral support he or she needs to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolin 2003&quot;&gt;Bolin, K., B. Lindgren, M. Lindstrom, and P. Nystedt. 2003. ''Investments in social capital implications of social interactions for the production of health.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=BMC Public Health – Full text – Does neighbourhood social capital aid in levelling the social gradient in the health and well-being of children and adolescents? A literature review|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=13|pages=65|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-65|pmid=23339776|pmc=3574053|year=2013|last1=Vyncke|first1=Veerle|last2=De Clercq|first2=Bart|last3=Stevens|first3=Veerle|last4=Costongs|first4=Caroline|last5=Barbareschi|first5=Giorgio|last6=Jónsson|first6=Stefán Hrafn|last7=Curvo|first7=Sara Darias|last8=Kebza|first8=Vladimir|last9=Currie|first9=Candace|last10=Maes|first10=Lea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrikova Ivica|first=Chadha Dhruv|date=2013|title=The Role of Social Capital in Risk-Sharing: Lessons from Andhra Pradesh|journal=Journal of South Asian Development|volume=8|issue=3|pages=359–383|doi=10.1177/0973174113504848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion, [[social support]], and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uphoff 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uphoff |first1=E |title=A systematic review of the relationships between social capital and socioeconomic inequalities in health: a contribution to understanding the psychosocial pathway of health inequalities |journal=International Journal for Equity in Health |volume=12 |date=2013 |issue=12 |pages=54 |doi=10.1186/1475-9276-12-54 |pmid=23870068 |pmc=3726325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uphoff |first1=E |title=Is ethnic density associated with health in a context of social disadvantage? Findings from the Born in Bradford cohort |journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health |date=2015 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=196–213 |doi=10.1080/13557858.2015.1047742|pmid=26169185 |hdl=10454/10076 |url=https://bradscholars.brad.ac.uk/bitstream/10454/10076/3/uphoff_et_al_2015.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becares |first1=L |title=Ethnic density and area deprivation: Neighbourhood effects on Māori health and racial discrimination in Aotearoa/New Zealand |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=2013 |volume=88 |pages=76–82|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.04.007 |pmid=23702212 |pmc=3725420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Becares |first1=L |title=Ethnic density effects on physical morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors: a systematic review of the literature |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=2012 |volume=102 |issue=12 |pages=e33-66 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300832 |pmid=23078507 |pmc=3519331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aslund 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aslund | first1 = C. | last2 = Starrin | first2 = B. | last3 = Nilsson | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = Social capital in relation to depression, musculoskeletal pain, and psychosomatic symptoms: a cross-sectional study of a large population-based cohort of Swedish adolescents | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 10 | page = 715 | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-715| pmid = 21092130 | pmc = 3091587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutherland &amp; Cressey, 1978&quot;&gt;[[Edwin H. Sutherland|Sutherland, Edwin H.]], and [[Donald R. Cressey]]. 1978. ''Criminology''. Philadelphia: [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.
Researchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uphoff 2013&quot; /&gt; This research is based on Bourdieu's notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdieu 1972&quot; /&gt;

== Influence of the Internet ==
Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shah, Kwak, &amp; Holbert, 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = D. V. | last2 = Kwak | first2 = N. | last3 = Holbert | first3 = R. L. | year = 2001 | title = &quot;Connecting&quot; and &quot;disconnecting&quot; with civic life: Patterns of Internet use and the production of social capital | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/77e7b0663f6774b3d6e1d51106020a9a0f96bcd2| journal = Political Communication | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 141–162 | doi=10.1080/105846001750322952}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci's blog (''Charlie on the Commuter Line'') to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rainie &amp; Wellman, 2012&quot;&gt;Rainie, Lee, and [[Barry Wellman]]. 2012. &quot;Networked Creators.&quot; Ch. 8 in ''Networked: The New Social Operating System.'' Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]] suggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as a ''[[social lubricant (disambiguation)|social lubricant]]'' for individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinfield et al., 2006&quot;&gt;Steinfield, C., J.

This argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online &quot;weak-ties&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cummings, Butler, &amp; Kraut, 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = J. | last2 = Butler | first2 = B. | last3 = Kraut | first3 = R. | year = 2002 | title = The quality of online social relationships | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 103–108 | doi=10.1145/514236.514242}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nie, 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nie | first1 = N.

Jones. Thousand Oaks, CA: [[SAGE Publishing|SAGE]].&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cummings, Butler, &amp; Kraut, 2002&quot; /&gt; However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boase, Jeffrey and [[Barry Wellman]]. 2005. &quot;Personal Relationships: On and Off the Internet.&quot; In ''Handbook of Personal Relationships'', edited by A.

Recent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00038.x|title = Do Internet Users Have More Social Ties?

Other research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McPherson | first1 = M. | last2 = Smith-Lovin | first2 = L. | last3 = Brashears | first3 = M. E. | year = 2006 | title = Social isolation in America: Changes in core discussion networks over two decades | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 353–375 | doi=10.1177/000312240607100301| citeseerx = 10.1.1.101.6700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before.

Ellison, Steinfield &amp; Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a &quot;maintenance&quot; of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N.B., Steinfield, C. &amp; Lampe, C (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely.

== Effects on educational achievement ==

=== Catholic schools (Coleman and Hoffer) ===
Coleman and Hoffer collected [[Quantitative research|quantitative data]] of 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;Coleman and Hoffer (1987) &quot;High School and Beyond&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was found from this [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal research]] that social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates in [[Catholic school]]s compared with the higher rates in public.

Teachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;Teachman et al. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Chen (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning.  One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults.  The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan 1999&quot;&gt;Morgan and Sorensen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community development ===
In the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that &quot;social capital is a useful lens for analysing [[lifelong learning]] and its relationship to community development.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, S., S. Johns, and B. Mulford. 2010. &quot;Social capital, educational institutions and leadership.&quot; In ''The International Encyclopedia of Education'' (3rd ed.), edited by E. Baker, B. McGraw &amp; P. Peterson. [[Elsevier Science]].&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with &quot;schools being designed to create 'functioning community' - forging tighter links between parents and the school&quot; linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;

=== Parental involvement ===
Putnam (2000) mentions in his book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', &quot;[[Child development]] is powerfully shaped by social capital&quot; and continues &quot;presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|296}} According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|300}} The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|301}} Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate &quot;the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|303}}

Without social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedin | first1 = Kent L. | last2 = Weiher | first2 = Gregory R. | year = 2011 | title = General Social Capital, Education-Related Social Capital, and Choosing Charter Schools | journal = The Policy Studies Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 4| pages = 609–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00424.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; state, &quot;one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.&quot; With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.

Sampson et al. (1999) stress the [[normative]] or goal-directed dimension of social capital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sampson|display-authors=etal|year=1999|title=Beyond social capital: Spatial dynamics of collective efficacy for children}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that &quot;resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson et al., 1999, p.635, quoted by Chen, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Difference in male and female ===
Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey in [[Hong Kong]] secondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders.&lt;ref&gt;Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaption and ethnic values ===
In his thesis &quot;New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance&quot;, Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process.&lt;ref&gt;Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) &quot;New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Min Zhou]] and [[Carl L. Bankston]] (1998), in their study of a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] community in [[New Orleans]], found that preserving traditional ethnic values enable [[immigrant]]s to integrate socially and to maintain [[social solidarity|solidarity]] in an ethnic community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Min Zhou|Zhou, Min]], and [[Carl L. Bankston]]. 1998. ''[[Growing Up American|Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States]]''. New York: [[Russell Sage Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society.  In her article &quot;Social Capital in Chinatown&quot;, Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of young [[Chinese American]]s is affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success.  Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch&lt;ref&gt;Stanton-Salazar (1995) (quoted by Wong, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; found that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances.

== In fields of study ==
=== Geography ===
In order to understand social capital as a subject in [[geography]], one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenets{{Who|date=February 2013}} of geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientist [[Robert D. Putnam|Robert Putnam]]. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984, [[Anthony Giddens]] developed a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative.

Another area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohan, p. 197&quot;&gt;Mohan, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohan, p. 197&quot; /&gt; A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohan, p. 197&quot; /&gt; Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper &quot;Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico&quot;, which states &quot;structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas.

=== Leisure studies ===
In the context of [[leisure studies]], social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glover | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Shinew | first2 = K.J. | last3 = Perry | first3 = D. | year = 2005 | title = Association, sociability, and civic culture: The democratic effect of community gardening | journal = Leisure Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 75–92 | doi=10.1080/01490400590886060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of social capital in relation to [[leisure]] is grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemingway&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemingway | first1 = J. L. | year = 1999 | title = Leisure, social capital, and democratic citizenship | url =http://www.jhemingway.net/Academics/Publications/Hemingway__Leisure_Social_Capital_Democratic_Citizeship.pdf | journal = Journal of Leisure Research | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 150–165 | doi = 10.1080/00222216.1999.11949855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central to [[democracy]] and democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the more [[autonomy]] the individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within a [[social structure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemingway&quot; /&gt;

'''The Solent''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|l|ən|t}} {{respell|SOH|lənt}}) is the [[strait]] that separates the [[Isle of Wight]] from the mainland of England. It is about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off}} long and varies in width between {{convert|2+1/2|and|5|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, although the [[Hurst Spit]] which projects {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|abbr=on}} into the Solent narrows the sea crossing between [[Hurst Castle]] and [[Colwell Bay]] to just over {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}}.

The Solent is a major shipping lane for passenger, freight and military vessels. It is an important recreational area for water sports, particularly [[yachting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solentpedia.info/enjoying_our_coast/take_to_the_water/|title=www.solentpedia.info|website=www.solentpedia.info|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting the [[Cowes Week]] sailing event annually. It is sheltered by the Isle of Wight and has a complex [[tide|tidal]] pattern, which has benefited [[Southampton]]'s success as a [[port]], providing a &quot;double high tide&quot; that extends the tidal window during which deep-draught ships can be handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpworldsouthampton.com/why-southampton/unbeatable-combination/|title=Unbeatable combination - DP World Southampton|website=www.dpworldsouthampton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portsmouth]] lies on its shores. [[Spithead]], an area off Gilkicker Point near [[Gosport]], is known as the place where the [[Royal Navy]] is traditionally [[Fleet Review|reviewed by the monarch of the day]].

The area is of great ecological and landscape importance, particularly because of the coastal and [[estuarine]] habitats along its edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solentpedia.info/our_biodiversity/habitats/|title=www.solentpedia.info|website=www.solentpedia.info|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its coastline is designated as a [[Special Area of Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solentpedia.info/our_coastal_zone/protected_areas/|title=www.solentpedia.info|website=www.solentpedia.info|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered by and forms a part of the character of a number of nationally important protected landscapes including the [[New Forest]] National Park, and the [[Isle of Wight AONB]].

==Etymology==
The word predates [[Old English]], and is first recorded in 731 as ''Soluente''. This original spelling suggests a possible derivation from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] element ''-uente'', which has endured throughout the history of Hampshire, as in the Roman city of [[Venta Belgarum]] (latinised as ''Venta''), the post-Roman kingdom of Y Went, and the modern name of [[Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko. [http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/lemma.html?id=17429 &quot;wentā&quot; in the ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' at ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionaries Online''. Brill Online, 2020. Accessed 18 March 2020.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It later appears in [[Anglo-Saxon]] records as ''Solentan''.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Mills, ''Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1998: {{ISBN|0-19-280074-4}}), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A pre-Celtic and supposedly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] root meaning &quot;free-standing rock&quot; has also been suggested as a possible description of the cliffs marking western approach of the strait. This Semitic origin may be a relic of the [[Phoenicia]]n traders who sailed to Britain from the Mediterranean as part of the [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times|ancient tin trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theo|first1=Vennemann|title=Europa Vasconica, Europa Semitica|pages=511–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggestion is that the name may reflect the number of [[Northern Gannet]]s (previously known as Solans or the Solan Goose) along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Heritage|url=http://www.solentpedia.info/our_heritage/|website=Solentpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
Originally a river valley, the Solent has gradually widened and deepened over many thousands of years.  The [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] was the source of the [[River Solent]], with four other rivers — the Rivers [[River Avon (Hampshire)|Avon]], [[River Hamble|Hamble]], [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] and [[River Test|Test]] — being tributaries of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/geology.htm |title=Geology of Hengistbury Head |publisher=www.hengistbury-head.co.uk |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/Solent-Introduction.htm |title=Solent Geology - Introduction - Dr. Ian West |publisher=Soton.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seismic]] sounding has shown that, when the sea level was lower, the River Solent incised its bed to a depth of at least {{convert|46|m|ft}} below current [[Ordnance Datum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The buried channels of the 'Solent River', southern England|journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association|volume=86|issue=2|pages=239–245|doi=10.1016/S0016-7878(75)80103-9|year=1975|last1=Dyer|first1=K.R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Solent/13SOL-Solent-River-Westaway-final.jpg Link to map showing former course of Solent River]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Purbeck Ball Clay]] contains [[kaolinite]] and [[mica]], showing that in the [[Lutetian]] stage of the [[Eocene]] water from a granite area, probably [[Dartmoor]], flowed into the River Solent.

Seabed survey shows that when the sea level was lower in the [[Ice Age]] the River Solent continued the line of the eastern Solent ([[Spithead]]) to a point roughly due east of the east end of the Isle of Wight and due south of a point about {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} west of [[Selsey Bill]], and then south-south-west for about {{convert|30|km|mi}}, and then south for about {{convert|14|km|mi|0}}, and then joined the main river flowing down the dry bed of the [[English Channel]].

During the Ice Age, meanders of the Solent's tributaries became incised: for example, an [[incised meander]] of the River Test is buried under reclaimed land under the [[Westquay]] shopping centre ([https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9035452,-1.4096499,1520m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en Google Earth link]), near Southampton docks;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://solentprotection.org/what-is-the-solent/|title=What is the Solent?|date=August 10, 2018|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Southampton/8STH-Southampton-Town-Geology.jpg link to geological map of the area]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the retreat of the most recent glaciation the [[South East of England]], like the [[Netherlands]], has been steadily slowly sinking through historic time due to [[forebulge sinking]].

A new theory – that the Solent was originally a lagoon – was reported in the ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]'' by Garry Momber from the [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/3671677.Secrets_of_the_Solent |title=Secrets of the Solent |date=14 Sep 2008 |author=Peter Law |newspaper=Daily Echo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisishampshire.net/news/4651158.The_secrets_of_the_deep/ thisishampshire.net, ''Startling evidence of a Stone Age structure in the Solent.''] - Retrieved 03 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stream.port.ac.uk/ENVIRONMENT/SCOPAC5/epag/epag.htm|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EfkFfgSH?url=http://www.stream.port.ac.uk/ENVIRONMENT/SCOPAC5/epag/epag.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 24, 2013|title=WebCite query result|website=www.webcitation.org|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Isle of Wight was formerly contiguous with the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in Dorset — [[the Needles]] on Wight and [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck are the last remnant of this connection.

[[Image:20050515 129 solent.jpg|thumb|[[Salt marsh]] near Lepe Country Park, with the Isle of Wight in the distance]]
Ten thousand years ago a band of relatively [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] [[chalk]] rock, part of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]], ran from the [[Isle of Purbeck]] area of south [[Dorset]] to the eastern end of [[Isle of Wight]], parallel to the [[South Downs]]. Inland behind the chalk were less resistant sands, clays and gravels. Through these weak soils and rocks ran many rivers, from the [[River Frome, Dorset|Dorset Frome]] in the west and including the [[River Stour, Dorset|Stour]], [[Beaulieu River]], [[River Test|Test]], [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] and [[River Hamble|Hamble]], which created a large [[estuary]] flowing west to east and into the English Channel at the eastern end of the present Solent. This great estuary ran through a wooded valley and is now referred to as the Solent River.&lt;ref name=murphy20/&gt;

When [[glacier]]s covering more northern latitudes melted at the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], two things happened to create the Solent. Firstly, a great amount of flood water ran into the Solent River and its tributaries, carving the estuary deeper. Secondly, [[post-glacial rebound]] after the removal of the weight of ice over [[Scotland]] caused the island of [[Great Britain]] to tilt about an east-west axis, because [[isostatic rebound]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Scandinavia]] is pulling [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] rock out from under the [[Netherlands]] and south [[England]]: this is [[forebulge sinking]].&lt;ref name=murphy20/&gt;

Over thousands of years, the land sank in the south (a process still continuing) to submerge many valleys creating today's characteristic [[ria]]s, such as [[Southampton Water]] and [[Poole Harbour]], as well as submerging the Solent. The estuary of the Solent River was gradually flooded, and eventually the [[Isle of Wight]] became separated from the mainland as the chalk ridge between [[The Needles]] on the island and [[Old Harry Rocks]] on the mainland was eroded. This is thought to have happened about 7,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=murphy20&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murphy|first=Peter|title=English Coast: A History and a Prospect|url=https://archive.org/details/englishcoasthist00murp|url-access=limited|publisher=Continuum|location=London|year=2009|isbn=978-1-8472-5143-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/englishcoasthist00murp/page/n33 19]–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of coastal change is still continuing, with the soft cliffs on some parts of the Solent, such as [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]], constantly eroding, whilst other parts, such as [[Ryde Sands]], are accreting.

The Solent is a comparatively shallow stretch of tidal water. It has an unusual double tide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/stuff/double_tides.htm|title=English Channel Double Tides|website=www.bristolnomads.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is both favourable and hazardous to maritime activities with its strong tidal movements and quickly changing sea states.

Coupled with the above, the Solent is renowned for its large volume of vessel usage, thus resulting in one of the highest density of declared lifeboat stations in the world.  This includes six [[RNLI]] (e.g. [[Calshot]] and [[Cowes]]) and five independently run stations (e.g. [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]] Lifeboat and [[Gosport and Fareham Inshore Rescue Service]]).

Remains of human habitation have been found from the prehistoric, [[Roman Britain|Roman]], and [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] eras, showing that humans retreated towards progressively higher ground over these periods. Offshore from [[Bouldnor]], Isle of Wight, divers have found at {{convert|11|m|ft}} depth the submerged remains of a wooden building that was built there on land around 6000 BC when the sea level was lower and the land was higher.&lt;ref&gt;Momber, G., Satchell, J &amp; Gillespie, J. 2009.

There is an early [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] period report that much land on the south of [[Hayling Island]] was lost to sea flood. South of Hayling Island in the Solent is a deposit of stones, which [[scuba diver]]s found to be the remains of a stone building, probably a [[Church (building)|church]]. There is an old report that this church was formerly in the middle of Hayling Island. If similar amounts of land have been lost on other parts of the Solent shore, the Solent was likely much narrower in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, and it is possible to believe [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s report that in his time men could wade to the Isle of Wight at low tide. Similarly, it is known that [[Selsey]] was once a port town, with [[Selsey Abbey]] and a [[cathedra]] recorded until 1075, when the see of the [[Diocese of Chichester|Diocese of Sussex]] was moved inland to [[Chichester]].

[[File:Calshot castle evening.JPG|thumb|[[Calshot Castle]] protected the mouth of [[Southampton Water]]]]In the early 16th century [[Henry VIII of England]] built an extensive set of [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defence]]s at each end of the Solent, part of his [[Device Forts]], effectively controlling access to east and west.  In 1545, a [[battle of the Solent|naval battle was fought in the Solent]] between English and French naval forces. The battle was inconclusive with no significant losses other than Henry VIII's flagship, the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', which foundered and sank while making a sharp turn. From a total crew of over 400, fewer than 35 survived the sinking. The remains of the ''Mary Rose'' were discovered at the bottom of the Solent by a salvage project in 1971 and were successfully salvaged in 1982.

In 1685 King [[James II of England|James II]] narrowly escaped shipwreck while sailing in the Solent. Musician [[Henry Purcell]] wrote &quot;They that go down to the sea in ships&quot; to be sung by the extraordinary voice of [[John Gostling]] in commemoration of this event. More forts were built on land and at sea in the 19th century. These were generally known as [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|Palmerston Forts]].

The Solent was one of two sites for the [[Sailing at the 1908 Summer Olympics|sailing]] events at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf 1908 Summer Olympics official report.] p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Solent became the departure area of the ill-fated ocean liner, [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], in April 1912.

A bank in the centre of the Solent, [[Bramble Bank]], is exposed at [[tide|low water at spring tide]]. This, combined with the unique tidal patterns in the area, makes navigation challenging. There is an annual [[cricket]] match on Bramble Bank during the lowest tide of the year, but games are often cut short by rising tide.&lt;br /&gt;

According to the BBC, the {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} tide at Ryde gives a major advantage to [[hovercraft]] which can travel right up a beach and the Solent is the only place in Western Europe where there is a regular passenger service. The operator, [[Hovertravel]], claims it is the world's only commercial passenger hovercraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovertravel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Hovercraft |url=https://www.hovertravel.co.uk/our-hovercraft/ |website=Hovertravel |publisher=Hovertravel |accessdate=9 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated 50 years of operation in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34658386|title=What happened to passenger hovercraft?|author=Justin Parkinson|work=BBC news magazine|date=9 November 2015|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

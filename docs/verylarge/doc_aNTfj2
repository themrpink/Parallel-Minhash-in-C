[[File:Manwithtinfoilhat.jpg|alt=|thumb|Man in a tin foil hat]]
A '''tin foil hat''' is a [[hat]] made from one or more sheets of [[aluminium foil]], or a piece of conventional headgear lined with foil, often worn in the belief or hope that it shields the [[Human brain|brain]] from threats such as [[electromagnetic field]]s, [[mind control]], and [[telepathy|mind reading]]. The notion of wearing homemade headgear for such protection has become a popular [[stereotype]] and byword for [[paranoia]], [[persecutory delusions]], and belief in [[pseudoscience]] and [[conspiracy theories]].

&quot;[[Tin foil]]&quot; is a common [[misnomer]] for [[aluminium foil]]; packaging metal foil was formerly made out of [[tin]] before it was replaced with [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foil - metallurgy |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/foil-metallurgy |website=Britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin  ==
Some people have a belief that such hats prevent [[mind control by governments]], spies, or paranormal beings that employ [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] or the [[microwave auditory effect]]. People in many countries who believe they are &quot;[[Electronic harassment|targeted individuals]]&quot;, subject to government spying or harassment, have developed websites, conference calls, and support meetings to discuss their concerns, including the idea of protective headgear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399_3.html|title=Mind Games|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|date=14 January 2007|work=Washington Post|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the term &quot;tin foil hat&quot; has become associated with [[paranoia]] and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crazy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hey Crazy--Get a New Hat |url=http://www.bostonist.com/archives/2005/11/15/hey_crazyget_a_new_hat.php |accessdate=5 April 2007 |date=15 November 2005 |publisher=Bostonist |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503051428/http://www.bostonist.com/archives/2005/11/15/hey_crazyget_a_new_hat.php |archivedate=3 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific basis ==
[[Electromagnetic radiation and health|Effects of strong electromagnetic radiation on health]] have been documented for quite some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_1979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neurophysiologic effects of Radiofrequency and Microwave Radiation |journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine |volume=55 |issue=11 |first=W. R. |last=Adey |date=December 1979 |pages=1079–1093|pmid=295243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of a metal enclosure in blocking electromagnetic radiation depends on the thickness of the foil, as dictated by the &quot;[[skin effect|skin depth]]&quot; of the conductor for a particular wave frequency range of the radiation. For half-millimetre-thick aluminum foil, radiation above about 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (i.e., including both [[AM band|AM]] and [[FM band]]s) would be partially blocked, although aluminum foil is not sold in this thickness, so numerous layers of foil would be required to achieve this effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Electrodynamics |first=John David |last=Jackson |publisher=Wiley Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-471-30932-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief also exists that aluminum foil is a protective measure against the effects of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (EMR) for many unspecified EMR frequencies.{{cn|date=July 2019}} There are some allegations that EMR exposure has negative health consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lean2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article362557.ece |title=Electronic smog |work=The Independent |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2009 |location=London |first=Geoffrey |last=Lean |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517030959/http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article362557.ece |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Allan H. Frey]] discovered that the [[microwave auditory effect]] (i.e., the reception of the induced sounds by radio-frequency electromagnetic signals heard as clicks and buzzes) can be blocked by a patch of [[wire mesh]] (rather than foil) placed above the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Allan H.|date=1962-07-01|title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=689–692|issn=8750-7587|pmid=13895081|doi=10.1152/jappl.1962.17.4.689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder &amp; Chou 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bem.10163 |last1=Elder |first1=Joe A. |last2=Chou |first2=C.K. |year=2003 |title=Auditory response to pulsed radiofrequency energy |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=24 |issue=S6 |pages=S162–73 |issn=0197-8462 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/106565261/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121104224846/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/106565261/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-04|pmid=14628312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 an experimental study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Soniak|first=Matt|date=2012-09-28|title=Tin Foil Hats Actually Make it Easier for the Government to Track Your Thoughts|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/09/tin-foil-hats-actually-make-it-easier-for-the-government-to-track-your-thoughts/262998/|access-date=2020-08-04|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2005-02-17|title=On the Effectiveness of Aluminium Foil Helmets: An Empirical Study|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708230258/http://people.csail.mit.edu/rahimi/helmet/|archive-date=2010-07-08|access-date=|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by a group of MIT students found that tin foil hats do shield their wearers from radio waves over most of the tested spectrum, but amplified certain frequencies, around 2.6 GHz and 1.2 GHz.

==In popular culture==
In 2014, [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] parodied the song [[Royals (song)|&quot;Royals&quot;]] by [[Lorde]] on his album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'', reworking it to &quot;Foil&quot;. The song references conspiracy theories such as the Illuminati and the New World Order, and Weird Al wears a tinfoil hat in the video.

In a 2016 article, the musician and researcher [[Meadow House|Daniel Wilson]] writing in paranormal magazine ''[[Fortean Times]]'' noted an early allusion to an &quot;insulative electrical contrivance encircling the head during thought&quot; in the unusual 1909 [[non-fiction]] publication ''Atomic Consciousness''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathurst1909&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Atomic Consciousness Abridgement |first=James |last=Bathurst |publisher=W. Manning, London |year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; by self-proclaimed &quot;seer&quot; John Palfrey (aka &quot;James Bathurst&quot;) who believed such headgear was not effective for his &quot;retention of thoughts and ideas&quot; against a supposed &quot;telepathic impactive impingement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2016&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Atomic-Consciousness |magazine=[[Fortean Times]] |date=June 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The usage of a metal foil hat for protection against interference of the mind was mentioned in a science fiction short story by [[Julian Huxley]], &quot;[[The Tissue-Culture King]]&quot;, first published in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MkQPztA7TTIC&amp;pg=PA118 p. 118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley1926&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Julian |author-link=Julian Huxley |title=The Tissue-Culture King: A Parable of Modern Science |volume= XV |year=1925–1926 |journal=[[The Yale Review]] |pages=479–504 |url=http://yalereview.yale.edu/volume-xv-1925-1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the protagonist discovers that &quot;caps of metal foil&quot; can block the effects of [[telepathy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley1927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Julian |title=The Tissue-Culture King |date=August 1927 |journal=[[Amazing Stories]] |quote=Well, we had discovered that metal was relatively impervious to the telepathic effect, and had prepared for ourselves a sort of tin pulpit, behind which we could stand while conducting experiments. This, combined with caps of metal foil, enormously reduced the effects on ourselves.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tin foil hats have appeared in such films as ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://time.com/5682464/area-51-raid-hat/ |title=Area 51 Raid But Make It Fashion: It Takes a Lot to Stand Out at Alien-Themed Festival But This Guy's Tin Foil Hat Is Working |last=Lang |first=Cady |date=September 20, 2019 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=March 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Noroi: The Curse]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2017-07-09/dvdanger-dont-knock-twice/ |title=DVDanger: Don't Knock Twice |last=Whittaker|first=Richard|date=July 9, 2017|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|access-date=April 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/36153/futurama-into-the-wild-green-yonder/ |title=Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder|last=Miller III|first=Randy|date=February 1, 2009|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=March 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book series ''[[Artemis Fowl]]'' by [[Eoin Colfer]] features a paranoid [[centaur]] character named Foaly, who wears a tin-foil hat to protect from mind-readers. The novel ''Idiots in the Machine'' by Edward Savio portrays a character who believes tin foil keeps harmful gamma rays away, becoming a media sensation after marketing a successful line of foil hats to Chicago.

In [[Brandon Sanderson]]'s [[Mistborn]] series, aluminum foil hats block magical emotion manipulation.

The 2019 [[HBO]] television series ''[[Watchmen (TV series)|Watchmen]]'' features the character Wade Tillman/Looking Glass, a police officer who wears a mask made of reflective foil, and while off-duty, a cap lined in foil to protect his mind from alien psychic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/watchmen-show-easter-eggs-episode-5/ |title=Watchmen: Biggest Comic Easter Eggs in Episode 5 |last=Erdmann |first=Kevin |date=November 18, 2019 |website=[[Screen Rant]] |access-date=March 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McCarthyism''' is the name given to the period when Senator Joseph McCarthy abused his power to frame his adversaries as communists in a legal setting to have them blacklisted in their industries. Today it is the practice of making accusations of [[subversion]] or [[treason]], especially when related to [[communism]], without proper regard for evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;authentichistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cold War Home Front: McCarthyism|url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/|website=AuthenticHistory.com|publisher=AuthenticHistory.com|access-date=21 May 2016|ref=authentichistory|archive-date=11 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511230647/http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to U.S. senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-Wisconsin) and has its origins in the period in the United States known as the [[Red Scare#Second Red Scare (1947–57)|Second Red Scare]], lasting from the late 1940s through the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storrs|first=Landon R.

What would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's rise to national fame. Following the [[First Red Scare]], President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed an [[executive order]] in 1947 to screen federal employees for association with organizations deemed &quot;totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive&quot;, or advocating &quot;to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.&quot; In 1949, a high-level [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official was convicted of [[perjury]] in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested an [[atomic bomb]]. The [[Korean War]] started the next year, raising tensions in the United States. In a speech in February 1950, McCarthy presented a list of alleged members of the [[Communist Party USA]] working in the State Department, which attracted press attention. ''McCarthyism'' was published for the first time in late March of that year in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', and in a [[political cartoon]] by [[Herblock]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The term has since taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts. In the early 21st century, the term is used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, and [[demagogic]] attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries.

During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being &quot;communists&quot; or &quot;communist sympathizers&quot;; they became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or [[private industry]] panels, committees, and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, academics, and labor-union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs were sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some were imprisoned. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts that were later overturned,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957) and ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'' (1957): Fried (1997), pp. 205, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; laws that were later declared unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;For example, California's &quot;Levering Oath&quot; law, declared unconstitutional in 1967: Fried (1997), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; dismissals for reasons later declared illegal&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Slochower v. Board of Education'' (1956): Fried (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Lawsuit|actionable]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Faulk vs. AWARE Inc., et al.'' (1962): Fried (1997), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; or extra-legal procedures, such as informal blacklists, that would come into general disrepute. The most notable examples of McCarthyism include the so-called investigations conducted by Senator McCarthy, and the hearings conducted by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC).

In his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', journalist [[Ronald Kessler]] quoted former FBI agent Robert J. Lamphere, who participated in all of the FBI's major spy cases during the McCarthy period, as saying that FBI agents who worked counterintelligence were aghast that FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] supported McCarthy. Lamphere told Kessler that &quot;McCarthyism did all kinds of harm because he was pushing something that wasn't so.&quot; The [[VENONA]] intercepts showed that over several decades, &quot;[t]here were a lot of spies in the government, but not all in the State Department,&quot; Lamphere said. However, &quot;[t]he problem was that McCarthy lied about his information and figures. He made charges against people that weren't true. McCarthyism harmed the counterintelligence effort against the Soviet threat because of the revulsion it caused. All along, Hoover was helping him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/mccarthy-conservatives/2008/04/07/id/323380/|title=The Real Story on Joe McCarthy|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|date=April 7, 2008|website=Newsmax|access-date=October 25, 2019|archive-date=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025184128/https://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/mccarthy-conservatives/2008/04/07/id/323380/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Herblock1950.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest uses of the term ''McCarthyism'' was in a cartoon by [[Herblock|Herbert Block]] (&quot;Herblock&quot;), published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 29, 1950.]]

President Harry S. Truman's [[Executive Order 9835]] of March 21, 1947, required that all federal civil-service employees be screened for &quot;loyalty&quot;. The order said that one basis for determining disloyalty would be a finding of &quot;membership in, affiliation with or sympathetic association&quot; with any organization determined by the attorney general to be &quot;totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive&quot; or advocating or approving the forceful denial of constitutional rights to other persons or seeking &quot;to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Robert J |first=Goldstein |year=2006 |title=Prelude to McCarthyism: The Making of a Blacklist |magazine=Prologue Magazine |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/fall/agloso.html |access-date=2017-01-16 |archive-date=2017-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118033528/https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/fall/agloso.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical period that came to be known as the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them with roots in the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by communism's emergence as a recognized political force and widespread social disruption in the United States related to unionizing and anarchist activities. Owing in part to its success in organizing labor unions and its early opposition to [[fascism]], and offering an alternative to the ills of capitalism during the [[Great Depression]], the [[Communist Party of the United States]] increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2007), pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; While the United States was engaged in [[World War II]] and allied with the [[Soviet Union]], the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the [[Cold War]] began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed communist [[puppet régime]]s in areas it had occupied across Central and Eastern Europe. The United States backed anti-communist forces in [[Greek Civil War|Greece]] and [[Chinese Civil War|China]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Although the [[Igor Gouzenko]] and [[Elizabeth Bentley]] affairs had raised the issue of Soviet espionage in 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply increased the sense of threat in the United States related to communism. The Soviet Union [[Soviet atomic bomb project|tested an atomic bomb]] in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected, raising the stakes in the Cold War. That same year, [[Mao Zedong]]'s communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing [[Kuomintang]]. Many U.S. policy people did not fully understand the situation in China, despite the efforts of China experts to explain conditions.{{explain|date=April 2019}} In 1950, the [[Korean War]] began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against communists from North Korea and China.

During the following year, evidence of increased sophistication in Soviet Cold War espionage activities was found in the West. In January 1950, [[Alger Hiss]], a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the HUAC. In Britain, [[Klaus Fuchs]] confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the [[Manhattan Project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] during the War. [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were arrested in 1950 in the United States on charges of stealing atomic-bomb secrets for the Soviets, and were executed in 1953.

Other forces encouraged the rise of McCarthyism. The more conservative politicians in the United States had historically referred to progressive reforms, such as [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]] and [[women's suffrage]], as &quot;communist&quot; or &quot;Red plots&quot;, trying to raise fears against such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; They used similar terms during the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]] when opposing the [[New Deal]] policies of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Many conservatives equated the New Deal with [[socialism]] or Communism, and thought the policies were evidence of too much influence by allegedly communist policy makers in the Roosevelt administration.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley (1995), p. 141; Fried (1990), pp. 6, 15, 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the vaguely defined danger of &quot;Communist influence&quot; was a more common theme in the rhetoric of anti-communist politicians than was espionage or any other specific activity.

[[File:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|upright|Senator Joseph McCarthy]]
McCarthy's involvement in these issues began publicly with a speech he made on [[Lincoln Day]], February 9, 1950, to the Republican Women's Club of [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. He brandished a piece of paper, which he claimed contained a list of known communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted as saying: ''&quot;I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1970), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This speech resulted in a flood of press attention to McCarthy and helped establish his path to becoming one of the most recognized politicians in the United States.

The first recorded uses of the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; were in the ''Christian Science Monitor'' on March 28, 1950 (&quot;Their little spree with McCarthyism is no aid to consultation&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|McCarthyism, n.}}; citing ''Christian Science Monitor'', March 28, 1950, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and then, on the following day, in a [[political cartoon]] by ''Washington Post'' editorial cartoonist Herbert Block (Herblock). The cartoon depicts four leading Republicans trying to push an elephant (the traditional symbol of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) to stand on a platform atop a teetering stack of ten tar buckets, the topmost of which is labeled &quot;McCarthyism&quot;. Block later wrote:

&quot;nothing [was] particularly ingenious about the term, which is simply used to represent a national affliction that can hardly be described in any other way. If anyone has a prior claim on it, he's welcome to the word and to the junior senator from Wisconsin along with it. I will also throw in a set of free dishes and a case of soap.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Block (1952), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Institutions==
A number of anti-communist committees, panels, and &quot;loyalty review boards&quot; in federal, state, and local governments, as well as many private agencies, carried out investigations for small and large companies concerned about possible Communists in their work forces.

In Congress, the primary bodies that investigated Communist activities were the HUAC, the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]], and the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]. Between 1949 and 1954, a total of 109 investigations were carried out by these and other committees of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1954, the [[United States Senate]] voted 67 to 22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On This Day: December 2, 1954 |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/anecdote/days/049week_1202.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; to condemn McCarthy for &quot;conduct that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute&quot;.

===Executive branch===
====Loyalty-security reviews====
[[File:Page one of Executive Order 9835.jpg|thumb|310x310px|Executive Order 9835, signed by President Truman in 1947]]
In the federal government, President Truman's Executive Order 9835 initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947. It called for dismissal if there were &quot;reasonable grounds&amp;nbsp;... for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Constitution of the Truman Presidency and the Post–World War II Era| editor1-first=Martin| editor1-last=Fausold| editor2-first=Alan| editor2-last=Shank| first=Donald R.| last=McCoy| year=1991| work=The Constitution and the American Presidency| publisher=SUNY Press| page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionamer0000faus/page/116 116]| isbn=978-0-7914-0468-3| url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionamer0000faus/page/116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truman, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was probably reacting in part to the Republican sweep in the [[United States House election, 1946|1946 Congressional election]] and felt a need to counter growing criticism from conservatives and anti-communists.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] took office in 1953, he strengthened and extended Truman's loyalty review program, while decreasing the avenues of appeal available to dismissed employees. [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]], chairman of the Civil Service Commission [[Executive Order 9835|Loyalty Review Board]], referred to the new rules he was obliged to enforce as &quot;just not the American way of doing things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], scientific director of the [[Manhattan Project]] that built the first atomic bomb, then working as a consultant to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], was stripped of his security clearance after a [[Oppenheimer security hearing|four-week hearing]]. Oppenheimer had received a top-secret clearance in 1947, but was denied clearance in the harsher climate of 1954.

Similar loyalty reviews were established in many state and local government offices and some private industries across the nation. In 1958, an estimated one of every five employees in the United States was required to pass some sort of loyalty review.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Once a person lost a job due to an unfavorable loyalty review, finding other employment could be very difficult. &quot;A man is ruined everywhere and forever,&quot; in the words of the chairman of President Truman's Loyalty Review Board. &quot;No responsible employer would be likely to take a chance in giving him a job.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] started keeping a list of organizations that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 groups. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In the context of a loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a question, but not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One of the most common causes of suspicion was membership in the [[Washington Bookshop Association]], a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts, and discounts on books.&lt;ref&gt;Fried (1990), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

====J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI====
[[File:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|upright|thumb|[[J. Edgar Hoover]] in 1961]]

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background investigations of employees were carried out by FBI agents. This was a major assignment that led to the number of agents in the bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases, they were not even told of what they were accused.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 211, 266 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover's influence extended beyond federal government employees and beyond the loyalty-security programs. The records of loyalty review hearings and investigations were supposed to be confidential, but Hoover routinely gave evidence from them to congressional committees such as HUAC.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (2002), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1951 to 1955, the FBI operated a secret &quot;[[Responsibilities Program]]&quot; that distributed anonymous documents with evidence from FBI files of communist affiliations on the part of teachers, lawyers, and others. Many people accused in these &quot;blind memoranda&quot; were fired without any further process.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI engaged in a number of illegal practices in its pursuit of information on communists, including burglaries, opening mail, and illegal wiretaps.&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Cox and Theoharis (1988), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the left-wing [[National Lawyers Guild]] were among the few attorneys who were willing to defend clients in communist-related cases, and this made the NLG a particular target of Hoover's. The office of this organization was burgled by the FBI at least 14 times between 1947 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other purposes, the FBI used its illegally obtained information to alert prosecuting attorneys about the planned legal strategies of NLG defense lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlg-npap.org/sites/default/files/Breach%20of%20Privilege%20NLG%20April%202014.pdf|title=Breach of Privilege: Spying on Lawyers in the United States|last=Yoder|first=Traci|date=April 2014|access-date=2019-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925213950/https://www.nlg-npap.org/sites/default/files/Breach%20of%20Privilege%20NLG%20April%202014.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI also used illegal undercover operations to disrupt communist and other dissident political groups. In 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute communists. At this time, he formalized a covert &quot;dirty tricks&quot; program under the name [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref name=C312/&gt; COINTELPRO actions included planting forged documents to create the suspicion that a key person was an FBI informer, spreading rumors through anonymous letters, leaking information to the press, calling for [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] audits, and the like. The COINTELPRO program remained in operation until 1971.

Historian [[Ellen Schrecker]] calls the [[FBI]] &quot;the single most important component of the anti-communist crusade&quot; and writes: &quot;Had observers known in the 1950s what they have learned since the 1970s, when the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] opened the Bureau's files, 'McCarthyism' would probably be called 'Hooverism'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker (1998), pp. 239, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress===
====House Committee on Un-American Activities====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pete Seeger]] --&gt;
{{main|House Un-American Activities Committee}}
The House Committee on Un-American Activities – commonly referred to as the HUAC – was the most prominent and active government committee involved in anti-communist investigations. Formed in 1938 and known as the Dies Committee, named for [[Martin Dies Jr.|Rep. Martin Dies]], who chaired it until 1944, HUAC investigated a variety of &quot;activities&quot;, including those of German-American Nazis during World War II. The committee soon focused on Communism, beginning with an investigation into Communists in the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in 1938. A significant step for HUAC was its investigation of the charges of espionage brought against Alger Hiss in 1948. This investigation ultimately resulted in Hiss's trial and conviction for perjury, and convinced many of the usefulness of congressional committees for uncovering Communist subversion.

HUAC achieved its greatest fame and notoriety with its investigation into the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]]. In [[Hollywood blacklist#The blacklist begins (1947)|October 1947]], the Committee began to subpoena screenwriters, directors, and other movie-industry professionals to testify about their known or suspected membership in the Communist Party, association with its members, or support of its beliefs. At these testimonies, this question was asked: &quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RxLbr0QPdgC&amp;q=mccarthyism+64+dollar+question&amp;pg=PA153 | title=The Performance of Power: Theatrical Discourse and Politics | publisher=[[University of Iowa Press]] | author=Case, Sue-Ellen; Reinelt, Janelle G.

The final wording [...] was adopted to circumvent the Party's tactic.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the &quot;[[Hollywood Ten]]&quot;, cited the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for [[contempt of Congress]]. Two of them were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Cardiomyopathy''' is a group of diseases that affect the [[heart muscle]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym/&gt; Early on there may be few or no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym/&gt; As the disease worsens, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], feeling [[fatigue (medical)|tired]], and  [[pedal edema|swelling of the legs]] may occur, due to the onset of [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym/&gt; An [[Heart arrhythmia|irregular heart beat]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]] may occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cardiomyopathy?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/signs|website=NHLBI|access-date=31 August 2016|date=22 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915080931/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/signs|archive-date=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected are at an increased risk of [[sudden cardiac death]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Risk&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is at Risk for Cardiomyopathy?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/atrisk|website=NHLBI|access-date=31 August 2016|date=22 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816115709/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/atrisk|archive-date=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Types --&gt;
Types of cardiomyopathy include [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], [[restrictive cardiomyopathy]], [[arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia]], and [[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy]] (broken heart syndrome).&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type/&gt; In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type/&gt; In dilated cardiomyopathy the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] enlarge and weaken.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type/&gt; In restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricle stiffens.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Cardiomyopathy|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/types|website=NHLBI|access-date=31 August 2016|date=22 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728023515/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/types|archive-date=28 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes --&gt;
In many cases, the cause cannot be determined.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Cau/&gt; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually [[Heredity|inherited]], whereas dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in about one third of cases.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Cau/&gt; Dilated cardiomyopathy may also result from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[heavy metals]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[cocaine]] use, and [[viral infections]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Cau/&gt; Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be caused by [[amyloidosis]], [[hemochromatosis]], and some [[cancer treatment]]s.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Cau&gt;{{cite web|title=What Causes Cardiomyopathy?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/causes|website=NHLBI|access-date=31 August 2016|date=22 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915092001/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/causes|archive-date=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy|Broken heart syndrome]] is caused by extreme emotional or physical stress.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Tx/&gt; Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Tx/&gt; Surgery may include a [[ventricular assist device]] or [[heart transplant]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=How Is Cardiomyopathy Treated?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/treatment|website=NHLBI|access-date=31 August 2016|date=22 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915082544/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/treatment|archive-date=15 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 cardiomyopathy and [[myocarditis]] affected 2.5 million people.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1545–1602|pmid=27733282|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6|pmc=5055577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects about 1 in 500 people while dilated cardiomyopathy affects 1 in 2,500.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Type/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Cardiovascular Pathology|date=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9781605478418|page=148|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjaOUqf9LEQC&amp;pg=PA148|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914000626/https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZjaOUqf9LEQC&amp;pg=PA148|archive-date=14 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is more common in young people.&lt;ref name=NIH2016Risk/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Ventricular fibrillation.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The arrhythmia, [[ventricular fibrillation]], seen on an ECG]]
Symptoms of cardiomyopathies may include fatigue, swelling of the lower extremities and [[shortness of breath]] after exertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Cardiomyopathy? - NHLBI, NIH|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/signs|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=25 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728023343/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/signs|archive-date=28 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional symptoms of the condition may include [[heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], fainting, and dizziness.&lt;ref name=ref2/&gt;

==Causes==

Cardiomyopathies are either confined to the heart or are part of a generalized systemic disorder, both often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability. Other diseases that cause heart muscle dysfunction are excluded, such as [[coronary artery disease]], [[hypertension]], or abnormalities of the [[heart valves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | publisher=McGraw-Hill | editor-last1=Kasper | editor-first1=DL | editor-last2=Fauci | editor-first2=AS | editor-last3=Hauser | editor-first3=SL | editor-last4=Longo | editor-first4=DL | editor-last5=Jameson | editor-first5=JL | editor-last6=Loscalzo | editor-first6=J | last1=Lakdawala | first1=NK | last2=Stevenson | first2=LW | last3=Loscalzo | first3=J | year=2015 | chapter=Chapter 287 | page=1553 | edition=19th | isbn=978-0-07-180215-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the underlying cause remains unknown, but in many cases the cause may be identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathophysiology of heart disease : a collaborative project of medical students and faculty|date=2011|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Lilly, Leonard S., Harvard Medical School.|isbn=978-1605477237|edition=5th|location=Baltimore, MD|oclc=649701807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism, for example, has been identified as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as has drug toxicity, and certain infections (including [[Hepatitis C]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AdamNicholson2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Adam A, Nicholson C, Owens L| title=Alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy. | journal=Nurs Stand | year= 2008 | volume= 22 | issue= 38 | pages= 42–7 | pmid=18578120 | type=Review | doi=10.7748/ns2008.05.22.38.42.c6565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WestphalRigopoulos2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Westphal JG, Rigopoulos AG, Bakogiannis C, Ludwig SE, Mavrogeni S, Bigalke B et al.| title=The MOGE(S) classification for cardiomyopathies: current status and future outlook. | journal=Heart Fail Rev | year= 2017 | volume= 22 | issue= 6 | pages= 743–752 | pmid=28721466 | doi=10.1007/s10741-017-9641-4 | s2cid=36117047 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DomontCacoub2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Domont F, Cacoub P| title=Chronic hepatitis C virus infection, a new cardiovascular risk factor? | journal=Liver Int | year= 2016 | volume= 36 | issue= 5 | pages= 621–7 | pmid=26763484 | doi=10.1111/liv.13064 | type=Review | url=http://hal.upmc.fr/hal-01274679/document | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Untreated [[celiac disease]] can cause cardiomyopathies, which can completely reverse with a timely diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;CiaccioLewis2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Ciaccio EJ, Lewis SK, Biviano AB, Iyer V, Garan H, Green PH| title=Cardiovascular involvement in celiac disease. | journal=World J Cardiol | year= 2017 | volume= 9 | issue= 8 | pages= 652–666 | pmid=28932354 | doi=10.4330/wjc.v9.i8.652 | pmc=5583538 |type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to acquired causes, molecular biology and genetics have given rise to the recognition of various genetic causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestphalRigopoulos2017&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SimpsonRutland2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Simpson S, Rutland P, Rutland CS| title=Genomic Insights into Cardiomyopathies: A Comparative Cross-Species Review. | journal=Vet Sci | year= 2017 | volume= 4 | issue= 1 | pages=19 | pmid=29056678 | doi=10.3390/vetsci4010019 | pmc=5606618 | type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more clinical categorization of cardiomyopathy as 'hypertrophied', 'dilated', or 'restrictive',&lt;ref name=&quot;FusterHurst2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valentin Fuster|author2=John Willis Hurst|title=Hurst's the heart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWQAJDrVV7gC&amp;pg=PA1884|access-date=11 November 2010|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-143225-2|pages=1884–|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527075031/http://books.google.com/books?id=eWQAJDrVV7gC&amp;pg=PA1884|archive-date=27 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become difficult to maintain because some of the conditions could fulfill more than one of those three categories at any particular stage of their development. The current [[American Heart Association]] definition divides cardiomyopathies into primary, which affect the heart alone, and secondary, which are the result of illness affecting other parts of the body. These categories are further broken down into subgroups which incorporate new genetic and molecular biology knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cardiomyopathy Classification: Ongoing Debate in the Genomics Era |vauthors=McCartan C, Maso R, Jayasinghe SR, Griffiths LR | date=2012 | journal=Biochem Res Int |volume=2012 | pages= 796926| pmid=22924131 |  doi=10.1155/2012/796926 | pmc=3423823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The pathophysiology of cardiomyopathies is better understood at the cellular level with advances in molecular techniques. Mutant proteins can disturb cardiac function in the contractile apparatus (or mechanosensitive complexes). Cardiomyocyte alterations and their persistent responses at the cellular level cause changes that are correlated with sudden cardiac death and other cardiac problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cellular mechanisms of cardiomyopathy|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2011-08-08|issn = 0021-9525|pmc = 3153638|pmid = 21825071|pages = 355–365|volume = 194|issue = 3|doi = 10.1083/jcb.201101100|first1 = Pamela A.|last1 = Harvey|first2 = Leslie A.|last2 = Leinwand|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment may include suggestion of lifestyle changes to better manage the condition. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and condition of disease, but may include medication (conservative treatment) or iatrogenic/implanted [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] for slow heart rates, [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|defibrillators]] for those prone to fatal heart rhythms, [[ventricular assist device]]s (VADs) for severe heart failure, or [[ablation]] for recurring dysrhythmias that cannot be eliminated by medication or mechanical cardioversion. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a [[heart transplant]].&lt;ref name=ref2/&gt;

'''Robert Bylot''' was a 17th-century [[List of explorers|explorer]] who made four voyages to the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He was uneducated and from a working-class background, but was able to rise to rank of [[Master Mariner|Master]] in the [[British Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

''1610 with Hudson:'' Bylot was first mate on [[Henry Hudson|Henry Hudson's]] ship ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'', during Hudson's 1610-1611 expedition into what is now known as [[Hudson Bay]]. In the spring of 1611, Hudson wanted to continue the expedition, but the crew wanted to return home. There was discontent between the Captain (Hudson) and members of the crew, and Bylot was stripped of his rank.  Later there was a mutiny in which Hudson, his son and several sailors were set adrift in an open boat. It was due to Bylot's navigational skills that ''Discovery'' was able to return from the Arctic safely; Hudson and his party were never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Upon return to England, Bylot was tried as a mutineer but was pardoned.

''1612 with Button:'' Bylot returned to Hudson Bay in 1612 with Sir [[Thomas Button]]. They wintered over at the mouth of the Nelson River, and in the spring of 1613 continued north.  They were able to reach [[65th parallel north|latitude 65°]], then returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= ExploreNorth|title= Biography of Robert Bylot|url= http://explorenorth.com/library/bios/bl-bylot.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1615:'' In 1615, the [[Muscovy Company]] hired Bylot to find the [[Northwest Passage]] as captain of ''Discovery''. He sailed west from [[Hudson Strait]] and was blocked by ice at [[Frozen Strait]].

''1616 with Baffin:'' The following year (1616), the Muscovy Company again hired Bylot to continue to search for the Northwest Passage.  This time he was accompanied by pilot [[William Baffin]].  The Bylot-Baffin voyage resulted in several notable achievements.  First was the circumnavigation and mapping of what is now called [[Baffin Bay]].  Second was the discovery of [[Smith Sound]], by which the North Pole would eventually be reached.  Third was the discovery of [[Lancaster Sound]], through which the Northwest Passage would eventually be found three centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, they were able to reach 77° 45' North latitude, a record which held for 236 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ExploreNorth|title= Biography of Robert Bylot|url= http://explorenorth.com/library/bios/bl-bylot.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bylot and Baffin's work in Baffin Bay was doubted by cartographers back in England.  As late as 1812, charts of the area only showed a dotted bulge with the words: ''Baffin's Bay according to the relation of W. Baffin in 1616, but not now believed''.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; When the bay was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] in 1818, the records of the Bylot-Baffin voyage proved extremely accurate.  In England, almost total credit for the discovery was given to Baffin, and Bylot was virtually ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Farley Mowat]] speculated two possible reasons for this: Bylot's lack of education and lower position relative to Baffin in English society, and his involvement in the mutiny during Hudson's expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bylot Island]], one of the more dramatic of the [[Canadian Arctic islands|Arctic Islands]], was named after him.

'''George Philip Lakoff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|k|ɒ|f}}; born May 24, 1941) is an American [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguist]] and [[philosopher]], best known for his thesis that people's lives are significantly influenced by the [[conceptual metaphor]]s they use to explain complex phenomena.

The conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s 1980 book ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' has found applications in a number of academic disciplines. Applying it to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led Lakoff into territory normally considered basic to [[political science]]. In his 1996 book ''[[Moral Politics]]'', Lakoff described [[Conservatism|conservative]] voters as being influenced by the &quot;[[strict father model]]&quot; as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[Liberalism|liberal]]/[[Progressivism|progressive]] voters as being influenced by the &quot;[[nurturant parent model]]&quot; as the [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual's experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being [[Framing (social sciences)|framed]] in [[Construction grammar|linguistic constructions]]. In ''Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Gulf'' (1991), he argues that the American involvement in the [[Gulf war]] was obscured or &quot;spun&quot; by the metaphors which were used by the first [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] administration to justify it.&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote= The most natural way to justify a war on moral grounds is to fit this fairy tale structure to a given situation. This is done by metaphorical definition, that is, by answering the questions: Who is the victim? Who is the villain? Who is the hero? What is the crime? What counts as victory? Each set of answers provides a different filled-out scenario. [...] As the gulf crisis developed, President Bush tried to justify going to war by the use of such a scenario. At first, he couldn't get his story straight. What happened was that he was using two different sets of metaphorical definitions, which resulted in two different scenarios [...].

Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[think tank]], the now defunct [[Rockridge Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= George Lakoff |publisher= Rockridge Institute |url= http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff |accessdate= 2007-06-13 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210922/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff |archivedate= 2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral Politics&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Lakoff| first = George| title = Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| year = 2002| location = Chicago| isbn = 0-226-46771-6| url = https://archive.org/details/moralpoliticswha00lako_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the scientific committee of the [[IDEAS Foundation for progress|Fundación IDEAS]] (IDEAS Foundation), Spain's [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]]'s think tank.

The more general theory that elaborated his thesis is known as [[embodied philosophy|embodied mind]]. Lakoff served as a professor of linguistics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1972 until his retirement in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= White|first1= Daphne|title= Berkeley author George Lakoff says, 'Don't underestimate Trump'|url= http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/05/02/berkeley-author-george-lakoff-says-dont-underestimate-trump/|publisher= Berkeleyside.com|date= May 2, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Reappraisal of metaphor===
Although some of Lakoff's research involves questions traditionally pursued by linguists, such as the conditions under which a certain linguistic construction is grammatically viable, he is best known for his reappraisal of the role that metaphors play in the socio-political life of humans.

Metaphor has been seen within the Western scientific tradition as a purely linguistic construction. The essential thrust of Lakoff's work has been the argument that metaphors are a primarily conceptual construction and are in fact central to the development of thought.

In his words: 
:&quot;Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.&quot;

According to Lakoff, non-metaphorical thought is possible only when we talk about purely physical reality; the greater the level of abstraction, the more layers of metaphor are required to express it. People do not notice these metaphors for various reasons, including that some metaphors become 'dead' in the sense that we no longer recognize their origin. Another reason is that we just don't &quot;see&quot; what is &quot;going on&quot;.

In intellectual debate, for instance, the underlying metaphor according to Lakoff is usually that argument is war (later revised to &quot;argument is struggle&quot;):
*He ''won'' the argument.
*Your claims are ''indefensible''.
*He ''shot down'' all my arguments.
*His criticisms were ''right on target''.
*If you use that ''strategy'', he'll ''wipe you out''.

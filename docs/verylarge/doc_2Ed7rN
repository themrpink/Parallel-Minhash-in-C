{{Decadebox BC|158}}

==Events and trends==
*The [[Egyptians]] invented a new and better calendar. It is based on both the moon and a star. They observed the annual appearance of the brightest star in the sky, [[Sirius]]. This calendar was more advanced than the [[Babylonian calendar]].

==Significant people==
* [[Erishum III]], [[Kings of Assyria|King of Assyria]], [[1590s BC|1598]]–1586 BC (traditional date), or ca. 1580–[[1560s BC|1567 BC]] (newer dating)

'''Johann George Adam Forster''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfɔʁstɐ}}; November 27, 1754&lt;ref name=&quot;birthdate&quot;&gt;Many sources, including the biography by [[Thomas P. Saine]], give Forster's birth date as November 26; according to Enzensberger, Ulrich (1996) ''Ein Leben in Scherben [A Life in Ruins]'', Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, {{ISBN|3-423-13248-5}}, the [[baptism]] registry of St Peter and Paul in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] lists November 27 as the date of birth and December 5 as the date of baptism: “Anno 1754.

His report of that journey, ''[[A Voyage Round the World]]'', contributed significantly to the ethnology of the people of [[Polynesia]] and remains a respected work. As a result of the report, Forster was admitted to the [[Royal Society]] at the early age of twenty-two and came to be considered one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.

After returning to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He taught natural history at the [[Collegium Carolinum (Kassel)|Collegium Carolinum]] in the [[Ottoneum]], [[Kassel]] (1778–84), and later at the [[Vilnius University|Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University)]] (1784–87). In 1788, he became [[librarian|head librarian]] at the [[University of Mainz]]. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on [[botany]] and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.

Forster was a central figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, including his close friend [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]. His ideas and personality influenced [[Alexander von Humboldt]], one of the great scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of [[Mainz]] in 1792, Forster played a leading role in the [[Mainz Republic]], the earliest [[republicanism|republican]] state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.

==Early life==
Georg Forster was born in the small village of [[Mokry Dwór, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór)]] near [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), in the region of [[Royal Prussia]], in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772|last = Friedrich|first = Karin|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-521-58335-0|location = |page = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the oldest of seven surviving children of [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] pastor. In 1765, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[tsarina|empress]] [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a [[Volga German|German colony]] on the [[Volga River]]. Georg, then ten years old, joined him. On the journey, which reached the [[Kalmykia|Kalmyk]] [[steppe]] on the lower Volga, they discovered several new species,&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book |others=Forster, Georg|title=A Voyage Round the World|first1=Nicholas|last1=Thomas |first2=Oliver|last2=Berghof |year=2000 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |isbn=0-8248-2091-6 |contribution=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young Forster learned how to conduct scientific research and practice [[cartography]]. He also became fluent in Russian.

The report of the journey, which included sharp criticism of the governor of [[Saratov]], was not well received at court. The Forsters claimed they had not received fair payment for their work&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the [[Dissenter]]'s Academy in [[Warrington]]&lt;ref name=&quot;boreham&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boreham|first=Ian|title=John Reinhold Forster|journal=Cook's Log|publisher=Captain Cook Society|year=1985|volume=8|issue=3|page=368|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/john-reinhold-forster|access-date=July 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200529/http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/john-reinhold-forster|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]]'s history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voegel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Steiner|editor-first1=Gerhard|editor-last2=Baege|editor-first2=Ludwig|title=Vögel der Südsee|trans-title=Birds of the South Seas|publisher=Insel-Verlag|year=1971|page=53|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world with Captain Cook==
[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|James Cook, portrait by Nathaniel Dance, c. 1775, [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich]]

In 1772, Forster's father became a member of the [[Royal Society]]. This and the withdrawal of [[Joseph Banks]]&lt;!-- cite; expand?--&gt; resulted in his invitation by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[admiralty]] to join [[James Cook]]'s [[Second voyage of James Cook|second expedition]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (1772–75). Georg Forster joined his father in the expedition again and was appointed as a [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] to his father. Johann Reinhold Forster's task was to work on a scientific report of the journey's discoveries that was to be published after their return.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtHome&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aulie |first1=Richard P. |author-link=Richard P. Aulie |date=1999 |title=The Voyages of Captain James Cook |chapter-url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/the-forsters-at-home |location= |publisher=Captain Cook Study Unit |isbn= |access-date=May 14, 2015 |chapter=The Forsters at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They embarked [[HMS Resolution (Cook)|HMS ''Resolution'']] on July 13, 1772, in [[Plymouth]]. The ship's route led first to the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], then through the Indian Ocean and the [[Southern Ocean]] to the islands of [[Polynesia]] and finally around [[Cape Horn]] back to England, returning on July 30, 1775. During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the [[Tonga]] islands, [[New Caledonia]], [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas Islands]] and [[Easter Island]]. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering [[Antarctica]]. The journey conclusively disproved the ''[[Terra Australis]] Incognita'' theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt;

Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first undertook studies of the [[zoology]] and [[botanics]] of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants. However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative [[geography]] and [[ethnology]]. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports on the people of Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without [[Western culture|Western]] or Christian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerknecht, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hodges, Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay.jpg|thumb|''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]] and [[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]] in [[Matavai Bay]]'' by [[William Hodges]]]]

Unlike [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], whose reports from a journey to Tahiti a few years earlier had initiated uncritical ''[[noble savage]]'' romanticism, Forster developed a sophisticated picture of the societies of the South Pacific islands.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerknecht, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; He described various [[social structure]]s and religions that he encountered on the [[Society Islands]], Easter Island and in Tonga and New Zealand, and ascribed this diversity to the difference in living conditions of these people. At the same time, he also observed that the languages of these fairly widely scattered islands were similar. About the inhabitants of the [[Nomuka]] islands (in the [[Ha'apai]] island group of present-day Tonga), he wrote that their languages, vehicles, weapons, furniture, clothes, tattoos, style of beard, in short all of their being matched perfectly with what he had already seen while studying tribes on [[Tongatapu]]. However, he wrote, &quot;we could not observe any subordination among them, though this had strongly characterised the natives of Tonga-Tabboo, who seemed to descend even to servility in their obeisance to the king.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VTW TT&quot;&gt;Forster, Georg. ''A Voyage Round the World'', Book II, Chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey was rich in scientific results. However, the relationship between the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- it would be great to have some quotes from Michael Hoare: &quot;The Tactless Philosopher&quot;, a bio of JR Forster--&gt; as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of modern travel literature==
[[File:TannaGroundDove.jpg|thumb|One of Forster's many illustrations of birds now extinct, the [[Tanna ground dove]], also known as Forster's dove of Tanna]] 
These conflicts continued after the journey with the problem of who should write the official account of the travels. [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], although willing to pay the promised money, was irritated with Johann Reinhold Forster's opening chapter and tried to have it edited. However, Forster did not want to have his writing corrected &quot;like a theme of a School-boy&quot;, and stubbornly refused any compromise.&lt;ref name=&quot;AtHome&quot; /&gt; As a result, the official account was written by Cook, and the Forsters were deprived of the right to compile the account and did not obtain payment for their work. During the negotiations, the younger Forster decided to release an unofficial account of their travels. In 1777, his book ''[[A Voyage Round the World|A Voyage Round the World in His Britannic Majesty's Sloop Resolution, Commanded by Capt. James Cook, during the Years, 1772, 3, 4, and 5]]'' was published. This report was the first account of Cook's second voyage (it appeared six weeks before the official publication) and was intended for the general public. The English version and his own translation into German (published 1778–80) earned the young author real fame. The poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] praised the book as the most important one of his time, and even today it remains one of the most important journey descriptions ever written. The book also had a significant impact on German literature, culture and science, influencing such scientists as [[Alexander von Humboldt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alexander|last1=Smith |title=Explorers of the Amazon |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VP8usYq7XEC&amp;pg=PA218 |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-226-76337-4 |publisher= University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it inspired many [[ethnology|ethnologists]] of later times.

Forster wrote well-polished German prose, which was not only scientifically accurate and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional [[travel literature]] of the time, insofar as it presented more than a mere collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable [[ethnography|ethnographical]] facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;voyage preface&quot;&gt;{{cite book |others=Forster, Georg|title=A Voyage Round the World|first1=Nicholas|last1=Thomas |first2=Oliver|last2=Berghof |year=2000 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |isbn=0-8248-2091-6 |contribution=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In ''A Voyage Round the World'' he even presented the songs sung by the people of [[Polynesia]], complete with lyrics and [[musical notation|notation]]. The book is one of the most important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson2011&quot;&gt;Ruth P. Dawson, “Navigating Gender: Georg Forster in the Pacific and Emilie von Berlepsch in Scotland.“ In: ''Weimar Classicism'', ed. David Gallagher. Lampeter, Wales: Edwin Mellen Press, 2011. 39-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Forsters also published descriptions of their South Pacific travels in the Berlin-based ''Magazin von merkwürdigen neuen Reisebeschreibungen'' (&quot;''Magazine of strange new travel accounts''&quot;), and Georg published a translation of &quot;''A Voyage to the South Sea, by Lieutenant [[William Bligh]], London 1792''&quot; in 1791–93.

==Forster at universities==
The publication of ''A Voyage Round the World'' brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Sally Hatch|url=http://openinquiryarchive.net/2012/04/28/disinterested-pleasure-and-aesthetic-autonomy/|title=Disinterested Pleasure and Aesthetic Autonomy in Georg Forster's Voyage 'round the World|journal=Open Inquiry Archive|volume=1|issue=5|year=2012|access-date=May 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024105542/http://openinquiryarchive.net/2012/04/28/disinterested-pleasure-and-aesthetic-autonomy/|archive-date=October 24, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respectable [[Royal Society]] made him a member on January 9, 1777,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.royalsoc.co.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=778|title = Fellows of the Royal Society – F|date = |accessdate = May 8, 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Society|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008133318/http://www.royalsoc.co.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=778|archivedate = October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was not even 23 years old. He was granted similar titles from academies ranging from [[Berlin]] to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronikier&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rakusa-Suszczewski|first=Stanisław|contribution=Introduction|language=Polish|others=Forster, Georg; translated by Michał Ronikier|title=Podróż naokoło świata|trans-title=Voyage Round the World|publisher=Czytelnik|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appointments, however, were unpaid.

He traveled to Paris to seek out a discussion with the American revolutionary [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://harpers.org/blog/2008/04/georg-forsters-recollection-of-benjamin-franklin/|title = Georg Forster's Recollection of Benjamin Franklin|date = April 13, 2008|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work = Harper's Magazine|last1 = Horton|first1 = Scott|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708031910/http://harpers.org/blog/2008/04/georg-forsters-recollection-of-benjamin-franklin/|archive-date = July 8, 2015|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, he went to Germany to take a teaching position as a Natural History professor at the [[Collegium Carolinum (Kassel)|Collegium Carolinum]] in [[Kassel]], where he met [[Therese Huber|Therese Heyne]], the daughter of classicist [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]]. She later became one of the first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], including [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the [[University of Göttingen]] where his friend [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal ''Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur''.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Forster's closest friend, [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmering]], arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the [[Rosicrucian]]s in Kassel, where Forster took the secret name ''Amadeus Sragorisinus Segenitor''.&lt;ref name=&quot;harp_intro&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Das Abenteuer der Freiheit und die Liebe zur Welt |encyclopedia=Georg Forster: Reise um die Welt : illustriert von eigener Hand |publisher=Eichborn |location=Frankfurt am Main |last=Harpprecht |first=Klaus |date=2007 |authorlink= |page=22 |isbn=9783821862033 |oclc=173842524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ForsterUniversitaetsstrasse.jpg|thumb|right|The house in which Georg Forster lived during his time in [[Mainz]], with a commemorative plaque next to the door]]
However, by 1783 Forster saw that his involvement with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; (it is said he was not good at money&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt;); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [[Commission of National Education]] and became Chair of Natural History at [[Vilnius University]] in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was accepted well in [[Vilnius]], but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with [[Immanuel Kant]] about the definition of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref&gt;Saine, pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785, Forster traveled to [[University of Halle|Halle]] where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTheContinent&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aulie |first1=Richard P. |author-link=Richard P.

Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodi|first=Leslie|chapter=Georg Forster: The &quot;Pacific Expert&quot; of eighteenth-century Germany|title=Literatur, Politik, Identität &amp;ndash; Literature, Politics, Cultural Identity|pages=29, 54|publisher=Röhrig Universitätsverlag|year=2002|isbn=3-86110-332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as [[Catherine II of Russia]] had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the [[Mulovsky expedition]]) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Robert J.|year=2008|title=The Mulovsky expedition and Catherine II's North Pacific empire|journal=Australian Slavonic and East European Studies|volume=21|issue=1/2|pages=101–126|url=http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/21:1-2/mulovsky-expedition|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025062759/http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/21:1-2/mulovsky-expedition|archivedate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]]. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in [[Mainz]], where he became head librarian of the [[University of Mainz]], a position held previously by his friend [[Johannes von Müller]], who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal]].&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster regularly published essays on contemporary explorations and continued to be a very prolific translator; for instance, he wrote about Cook's third journey to the South Pacific, and about the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty]] expedition, as well as translating Cook's and Bligh's diaries from these journeys into German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Robert J.|title=The Call of the South Seas: Georg Forster and the expeditions to the Pacific of Lapérouse, Mulovsky and Malaspina|journal=Georg-Forster-Studien|volume=XIII|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his London years, Forster was in contact with Sir [[Joseph Banks]], the initiator of the Bounty expedition and a participant in Cook's first journey. While at the University of Vilnius he wrote the article &quot;Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay&quot;, published in the ''Allgemeines historisches Taschenbuch'' (Berlin, December 1786), an essay on the future prospects of the English colony founded in [[New South Wales]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay|last = Sprengel|first = Matthias Christian|publisher = Australasian Hydrographic Society|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/content/view/47/59/|orig-year = 1787|trans-title = New Holland and the British Colony at Botany Bay|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719062302/http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/content/view/47/59/|archive-date = July 19, 2008|chapter = German text (Google Books)|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MvM9AAAAcAAJ&amp;q=Taschenbuch+1787+Forster&amp;pg=PA11|others = Translated by Robert J.

Another interest of his was [[indology]] – one of the main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He translated the [[Sanskrit]] play ''[[Shakuntala]]'' using a [[Latin]] version provided by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]; this strongly influenced [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and triggered German interest in the culture of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ackerknecht&quot;&gt;Ackerknecht, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Views from the Lower Rhine''==
[[File:Cathedral Arch.jpg|thumb|left|One of the entrances of [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was praised in ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'']]
In the second quarter of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the [[Southern Netherlands]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], and England, eventually finishing in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790'' (''Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790''), published 1791–94. Goethe said about the book: &quot;One wants, after one has finished reading, to start it over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer.&quot; The book includes comments on the [[history of art]] that were as influential for the discipline as ''A Voyage Round the world'' was for [[ethnology]]. Forster was, for example, one of the first writers who gave just treatment to the [[Gothic architecture]] of [[Cologne Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely perceived as &quot;barbarian&quot; at that time. The book conformed well to the early [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850: A-L|last = Murray|first = Christopher John|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-57958-423-8|location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro002unse_v8y9/page/365 365]|url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro002unse_v8y9/page/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster's main interest, however, was again focused on the social behavior of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on he was to be a confident opponent of the [[ancien régime]]. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the [[Storming of the Bastille]], he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]], that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schweigard|first=Jörg|title=Freiheit oder Tod!|trans-title=Liberty or Death!|journal=[[Die Zeit]]|issue=29|year=2001|url=http://www.zeit.de/2001/29/200129_a-14_juli_xml|language=German|access-date=May 30, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905224929/http://www.zeit.de/2001/29/200129_a-14_juli_xml|archive-date=September 5, 2005|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life as a revolutionary==

===Foundation of the Mainz Republic===
[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|right|A [[liberty pole]], a symbol of revolutionary France as used in the [[Republic of Mainz]]. Watercolor by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].]]
The French revolutionary army under [[General Custine]] gained control over [[Mainz]] on October 21, 1792. Two days later, Forster joined others in establishing a [[Jacobin Club]] called &quot;Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit&quot; (&quot;Friends of Freedom and Equality&quot;) in the [[Electoral Palace Mainz|Electoral Palace]]. From early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing the [[Mainz Republic]]. This first republic located on German soil was constituted on the principles of democracy, and encompassed areas on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] between [[Landau]] and [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. Forster became vice-president of the republic's temporary administration and a candidate in the elections to the local parliament, the {{lang|de|Rheinisch-Deutscher Nationalkonvent}} (''Rhenish-German National Convention''). From January to March 1793, he was an editor of {{lang|de|Die neue Mainzer Zeitung oder Der Volksfreund}} (''The new Mainz newspaper or The People's Friend''), a name chosen in reference to [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]]'s {{lang|fr|L'Ami du peuple}}.&lt;ref&gt;Harpprecht, ''Das Abenteuer der Freiheit'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In his first article he wrote:
{{quote|Die Pressefreiheit herrscht endlich innerhalb dieser Mauern, wo die Buchdruckerpresse erfunden ward.&lt;ref name=&quot;SZ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Wolf|title=Freiheit, das Riesenkind|trans-title=Freedom, the giant child|journal=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=May 17, 2010|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/aufmacher-xv-freiheit-das-riesenkind-1.423586|language=German|access-date=February 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708135125/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/aufmacher-xv-freiheit-das-riesenkind-1.423586|archive-date=July 8, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|''The [[freedom of the press]] finally reigns within these walls where the [[printing press]] was invented.''}}
This freedom did not last long, though. The Mainz Republic existed only until the retreat of the French troops in July 1793 after the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]].

Forster was not present in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and [[Adam Lux]] had been sent to Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an independent state – to become a part of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]]. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHKMLA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/mainzrep.html|title=The Mainz Republic|publisher=World History at KMLA (WHKLMA)|accessdate=May 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202218/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/mainzrep.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Forster, Georg|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death in revolutionary Paris===
[[File:James Gillray Pinnacle of Liberty.jpeg|thumb|&quot;The Pinnacle of Liberty&quot;, a satire by [[James Gillray]]]]
Based on a decree by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] inflicting punishments on German subjects who collaborated with the French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the [[Imperial ban]]; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband [[Ludwig Ferdinand Huber]], he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the [[Reign of Terror]] introduced by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] under the rule of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance [[Friedrich Schiller]], Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the reign of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; in his small attic apartment at Rue des Moulins&lt;ref name=&quot;hr&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.hr-online.de/servlet/de.blueorange.xred.util.GetFile/04-165.rtf?db=hrmysql&amp;tbl=int_xredfile&amp;key=id&amp;keyval=11787328&amp;imgcol=xred_file|medium=radio script (RTF)|last=Schell|first=Christa|title=Die Revolution ist ein Orkan|trans-title=The Revolution is a Hurricane|date=November 26, 2004|accessdate=April 12, 2012|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001051325/http://www.hr-online.de/servlet/de.blueorange.xred.util.GetFile/04-165.rtf?db=hrmysql&amp;tbl=int_xredfile&amp;key=id&amp;keyval=11787328&amp;imgcol=xred_file|archive-date=October 1, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in January 1794, at the age of thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

==Views on nations and their culture==
Forster had partial Scottish roots and was born in Polish [[Royal Prussia]], and therefore was by birth a Polish subject. He worked in Russia, England, Poland and in several German countries of his time. Finally, he finished his life in France. He worked in different milieus and traveled a lot from his youth on. It was his view that this, together with his scientific upbringing based on the principles of the Enlightenment, gave him a wide perspective on different ethnic and national communities:

[[File:Forsterundsohn.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and Georg Forster in [[Tahiti]], by [[John Francis Rigaud]], 1780]]

{{quote|All peoples of the earth have equal claims to my good will&amp;nbsp;... and my praise and blame are independent of national prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=Johann Georg|title=Georg Forsters Werke, Sämtliche Schriften, Tagebücher, Briefe|trans-title=Georg Forster's works, all writings, diaries, letters|publisher=Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin|editor-first1=Gerhard|editor-last1=Steiner|year=1958|volume=II|pages=13–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In his opinion all human beings have the same abilities with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it is obvious that the culture on [[Tierra del Fuego]] is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleingeld |first=Pauline |title=Six Varieties of Cosmopolitanism in Late Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |date=1999 |volume=60 |issue=3 |page=515 |issn=0022-5037 |url=http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/publicaties/Kleingeld/six_varieties_of_cosmopolitanism.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228091212/http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/publicaties/Kleingeld/six_varieties_of_cosmopolitanism.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2008 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0025 |hdl=1887/8607 |s2cid=59415888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the attitude expressed in these writings and to his Enlightenment background, he used insulting terms expressing prejudice against Poles in his private letters during his stay in Vilnius and in a diary from the journey through Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawaty|first=Andreas|contribution=&quot;Polnische Wirtschaft&quot; und &quot;deutsche Ordnung&quot;: Nachbarbilder und ihr Eigenleben|title=Der Fremde, Interdisziplinäre Beiträge zu Aspekten von Fremdheit|trans-title=The Stranger, Interdisciplinary Contributions to Aspects of Foreignness|editor-first1=Bernhard|editor-last1=Oestreich|publisher=Peter Lang Verlag|year=2003|pages=156–166|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krause|first=Hans-Thomas|contribution=Georg Forster und Polen|title=Georg Forster (1754–1794).

==Legacy==
After Forster's death, his works were mostly forgotten, except in professional circles. This was partly due to his involvement in the French revolution. However, his reception changed with the politics of the times, with different periods focusing on different parts of his work. In the period of rising nationalism after the Napoleonic era he was regarded in Germany as a &quot;traitor to his country&quot;, overshadowing his work as an author and scientist. This attitude rose even though the philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] wrote about Forster at the beginning of the 19th century:
{{quote|Among all those authors of prose who are justified in laying claim to a place in the ranks of German classics, none breathes the spirit of free progress more than Georg Forster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlegel&quot;&gt;Schlegel, Friedrich. ''Kritische Schriften'', ed. W. Rasch, 2nd ed., Munich: Hanser 1964, translated by T. Saine in the preface to ''Georg Forster''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some interest in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived in the context of the liberal sentiments leading up to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saine&quot;&gt;Saine, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] and more so in the [[Third Reich]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hr&quot;/&gt; where interest in Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in [[East Germany]], where he was interpreted as a champion of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wurzner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Würzner|first=M.

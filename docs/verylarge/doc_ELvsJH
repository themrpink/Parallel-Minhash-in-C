====NE monsoon====
The city of Chennai is located on the east coast of India, which is also known as the [[Coromandel Coast]].
Chennai is largely dependent on [[Northeast monsoon|NE monsoon]], since 65% of rains are received in this season. Cyclones and depressions are common features during the season. Cyclones, in particular, are especially unpredictable. They may even move towards [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], west [[Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]], and also [[Myanmar]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The season between October and December is referred as the NE monsoon period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/12imd.htm|title=NE monsoon sets in, brings in copious rains|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Floods are common during this period. In [[2015 Chennai Floods|2015 Chennai]] received record-breaking rains since 1918, which caused massive floods.

The entire east coast is vulnerable to cyclones during the monsoon period. For example, in 2007 a major cyclone named &quot;[[Cyclone Sidr]]&quot; skipped Chennai and headed towards Bangladesh. The result was a failure of NE monsoon in Chennai, that particular year. Even in the past, there has been many occasions where cyclones had a great influence on the monsoon.

===Land usage===
As of 2018, the city had a green cover of 14.9 percent, against the [[World Health Organization]] recommendation of 9&amp;nbsp;square meters of green cover per capita in cities. The city had a built-up area of 71 percent. Waterbodies cover an estimated 6 percent of the total area, and at least 8 percent of the area has classified as open space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindu_228CrProjectForGreen&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Politics===
Since the 19th century, when Western scholars proposed that [[Dravidian languages]], which dominated the southern region of India, formed a different linguistic group to that of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] that are predominant in the north of the subcontinent, the aspects of Tamil nationalism gained prominence. This resulted in the [[Anti-Hindi agitations]] in the city and across the state. However, the post-[[Partition of India|Independence]] re-organisation of Indian states according to linguistic and ethnic basis has moderated Tamil nationalism, especially the demand for separation from the Indian Union. The [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|Anti-Hindi agitations in mid-1960s]] made the DMK more popular and more powerful political force in the state. The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu3&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/article61129.ece | title = Language issue again: the need for a clear-headed policy | author = S.

Being the capital of the [[Madras Province]] that covered a vast area of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, Chennai remained the centre of politics in the southern region of India during the British colonial era. After [[Partition of India|Independence]], it remained the centre of political activities of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Chennai is the birthplace of the idea of the [[Indian National Congress]], commonly known as the Congress Party. Founded by Indian and British members of the [[Theosophical Society]] movement, most notably [[Allan Octavian Hume|A.O. Hume]],&lt;ref name=bevir&gt;[http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/73b4862g?display=all Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress], Bevir, Mark, University of California, Berkeley, Publication Date: 1 January 2003 s. 14–18. Original Citation: Mark Bevir, &quot;Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress&quot;, [[International Journal of Hindu Studies]] 7 (2003), 99–115. E.g., &quot;Theosophical Society provided the framework for action within which some of its Indian and British members worked to form the Indian National Congress.&quot;, &quot;1884 annual convention of the Theosophical Society. At this convention, Rao argued that the Society should start formally to discuss the political situation in India as well as more strictly religious matters. Although Rao did not get his way, he did arrange a meeting of sympathetic theosophists to be held at his home. Those who attended this meeting with Rao included Aiyar, Ananda Charlu, and M. Viraraghavachariar. They formed the Madras Mahajana Sabha,&quot; &quot;meeting to coincide with the next annual convention of the Theosophical Society. This meeting would promote their idea of an all-India body.&quot; &quot;Hume was probably the single most important individual for the formation of the Indian National Congress.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in the city in December 1884.&lt;ref name=pattabhi&gt;Sitaramayya, B.

After independence, the city hosted the Congress in 1955 in its suburb of [[Avadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Political and Social Conflict in South India; The non-Brahmin movement and Tamil Separatism, 1916–1929| last=Irschick| first=Eugene F.| year=1969| oclc=249254802| publisher=[[University of California Press]]| url=http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Irschick/Politics.pdf| access-date=23 September 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001539/http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Irschick/Politics.pdf| archive-date=4 March 2016| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chennai is also the birthplace of several regional political movements since the British era. South Indian Welfare Association, one of the earliest regional parties, was founded in 1916, which later came to be known as the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], which was the main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;rajaraman4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rajaraman|1988| loc=ch. 4 (Ideology, Organisation and Programme of the Justice Party)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irschick10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Irschick|1969| pp=172–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the party was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] (DK) by [[E.

The party was a non-political party that demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Taylor |first = Richard Warren |title = Religion and Society: The First Twenty-five Years, 1953–1978 |publisher = Christian Literature Society (for the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society, Bangalore) |year = 1982 |oclc = 9007066 |page = 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the differences between its two leaders Periyar and [[C.

With the history of many neighbourhoods of the city such as [[Mylapore]], [[Triplicane]], and [[Tiruvanmiyur]] antedating that of the city, the architecture of Chennai ranges in a wide chronology. The oldest buildings in the city dates from the 7th and 8th centuries CE, which include the [[Kapaleeshwarar Temple]] in Mylapore and the [[Parthasarathy Temple]] in Triplicane, built in the [[Dravidian architecture]]. This architecture includes various styles, such as those of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Chola]]s, and the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] empires. The associated ''Agraharam'' architecture, which consists of traditional row houses surrounding a temple, can still be seen in these areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agraharam_TimeVirtuallyStandsStill&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sujatha |first=R. |title=Agraharam – time virtually stands still here |newspaper=The Hindu |location=Chennai |date=29 April 2012 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3367816.ece |access-date=28 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705142259/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3367816.ece |archive-date=5 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VanishingAgraharams&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Iyer | first = Aruna V. | title = Chennai's vanishing agraharams | newspaper = The Hindu | location = Chennai | date = 7 October 2011 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/article2518383.ece | access-date = 28 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120430024916/http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/article2518383.ece | archive-date = 30 April 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Heritage Site|heritage temples]] at [[Mamallapuram]] at the outskirts of the city are some of the examples of the Pallava architecture.

The best examples of this style include the [[Madras High Court]] (built in 1892), [[Southern Railway headquarters, Chennai|Southern Railway headquarters]], [[Ripon Building]], [[Government Museum, Chennai|Government Museum]], Senate House of the [[University of Madras]], [[Amir Mahal]], [[Bharat Insurance Building]], [[Victoria Public Hall]] and the [[College of Engineering, Guindy|College of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The construction of the National Art Gallery in Madras was completed in 1909. The new building, with a stunning façade, was built of pink sandstone brought from Sathyavedu, and formed part of the Madras Museum campus. It was opened, on 23 January 1909, by the Governor of Fort St. George, Sir [[Arthur Lawley]], and called the Victoria Memorial Hall after the Queen-Empress Victoria.&lt;ref name=VictoriaRegina&gt;&quot;New for Old&quot;.

By the early 20th century, the [[art deco]] too made its entry upon the city's urban landscape. From the 1930s onwards, many buildings in [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] were built in this style, including the United India building (presently housing LIC) and the Burma Shell building (presently the Chennai House), both built in the 1930s, and the Dare House, built in 1940.

This resulted in the city expanding horizontally, unlike other metropolitan cities where vertical growth is prominent. On the contrary, the peripheral regions, especially on the southern and south-western sides, are experiencing vertical growth with the construction of buildings up to 60 floors.

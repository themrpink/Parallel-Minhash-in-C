==Translating idioms==
A [[literal translation|literal word-by-word translation]] of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom ''kick the bucket'' has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as ''kopnąć w kalendarz'' (&quot;kick the calendar&quot;) in Polish, ''casser sa pipe'' (&quot;to break his pipe&quot;) in French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-fr?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in French |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tirare le cuoia'' (&quot;pulling the leathers&quot;) in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-it?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in Italian |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some idioms are transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of their meaning does get through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, ''lay one's cards on the table'' meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; ''spill the beans'' (to let secret information become known) and ''leave no stone unturned'' (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) [[English language]] in [[polysemes]], the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a [[verb]].

Idioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many [[natural language]] words have ''idiomatic origins'', but are assimilated, so losing their figurative senses, for example, in Portuguese, the expression ''saber de coração'' 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb ''decorar'', meaning ''memorize''.

In 2015, [[TED (conference)|TED]] collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying &quot;to slide in on a shrimp sandwich&quot;, which refers to somebody who didn't have to work to get where they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/|title=40 brilliant idioms that simply can’t be translated literally|website=TED Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, idioms may be shared between multiple languages. For example, the Arabic phrase في نفس المركب (fi nafs al-markab) is translated as &quot;in the same boat,&quot; and it carries the same figurative meaning as the equivalent idiom in English.

According to German linguist Elizabeth Piirainen, the idiom &quot;to get on one's nerves&quot; has the same figurative meaning in 57 European languages. She also says that the phrase &quot;to shed crocodile tears,&quot;—meaning to express insincere sorrow—is similarly widespread in European languages, but is also used in Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Chinese, Mongolian, and several others.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The origin of cross-language idioms is uncertain. One theory is that cross-language idioms are a [[language contact]] phenomenon, resulting from a word-for-word translation called a [[calque]]. Piirainen says that this may happen as a result of [[lingua franca]] usage; speakers incorporate expressions from their own native tongue, exposing them to speakers of other languages. Other theories suggest they come from a shared ancestor language or that humans are naturally predisposed to develop certain metaphors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Dealing with non-compositionality==
The non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] in any sense. For example:

{{quote|How do we '''get to the bottom of''' this situation?}}

The fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here ''this situation'') is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, ''How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /'' etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the [[Construction Grammar]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;Culicver and Jackendoff (2005:32ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne and Groß (2012:173ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The [[dependency grammar]] trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:

::[[File:Idiom trees 1'.png|Idiom trees 1']]

The fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:

::[[File:Idiom trees 2.png|Idiom trees 2]]

The fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective ''nitty-gritty'' and the adverb ''always'' are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.

The catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The [[Principle of Compositionality]] can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.

Various studies have investigated methods to develop the ability to interpret idioms in children with various diagnoses including Autism,&lt;ref&gt;Mashal and Kasirer, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate Learning Difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;Ezell and Goldstein, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental Language Disorder &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Ebbels and Newton, 2020&lt;/ref&gt; and typically developing weak readers.&lt;ref&gt;Lundblom and Woods, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiword expression==
A multiword expression is &quot;lexical units larger than a word that can bear both idiomatic and compositional meanings. (...) the term multi-word expression is used as a pre-theoretical label to include the range of phenomena that goes from collocations to fixed expressions.&quot; It is a problem in [[natural language processing]] when trying to translate lexical units such as idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Peter |last2=Ohneiser |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Olsen |first3=Susan |last4=Rainer |first4=Franz |title=Word Formation, An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe (HSK Series) |date=Oct 2011 |publisher=Berlin: De Gruyter |page=Chapter 25: Multword Expressions |url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/static/mh/Huening_Schluecker_2015_ms.pdf |access-date=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-45715-1_1 |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1810 |access-date=8 August 2018|chapter=Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for NLP |title=Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing |volume=2276 |pages=1–15 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2002 |last1=Sag |first1=Ivan A |last2=Baldwin |first2=Timothy |last3=Bond |first3=Francis |last4=Copestake |first4=Ann |last5=Flickinger |first5=Dan |isbn=978-3-540-43219-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sailermarkantonatou&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

'''''Squalius cephalus'''''&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; is a European species of freshwater [[fish]] in the carp [[family (biology)|family]] [[Cyprinidae]]. It frequents both slow and moderate rivers, as well as canals and still waters of various kinds. This species is referred to as the '''common chub''', '''European chub''', or simply '''chub'''.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

==Description==
It is a stocky fish with a large rounded head. Its body is long and cylindrical in shape and is covered in large greenish-brown scales which are edged with narrow bands of black across the back, paling to golden on the flanks and even paler on the belly. The tail is dark brown or black, the [[dorsal fin]] is a greyish-green in colour and all the other fins being are orange-red.&lt;ref name = Fish-UK&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fish-uk.com/species_chub.htm | title = Chub | accessdate = 3 December 2017 | publisher = Fish-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsal fin has 3 spines and 7-9 soft rays while the [[anal fin]] has 3 spines and 7-10 rays. The vertebrae count is 42-48. It can grow to 60&amp;nbsp;cm [[standard length]] but most fish are around 30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name = FB&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fishbase.se/summary/Squalius-cephalus.html | title = ''Squalius cephalus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) Chub | accessdate = 3 December 2017 | publisher = [[Fishbase]] | editor1 = Rainer Froese | editor2 = Daniel Pauly | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The chub is distributed throughout most of northern Eurasia, it can be found in the rivers flowing into the [[North Sea|North]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], northern [[Black Sea|Black]], [[White Sea|White]], [[Barents Sea|Barents]] and [[Caspian Sea]] basins, the Atlantic basins south to [[Adour]] drainage in France and in Great Britain north to 56&amp;nbsp;°C, in Scandinavia in southern Finland and southern Sweden north to around [[Stockholm]]. In the Mediterranean basin it is found in France from the [[Var (river)|Var]] to the [[Hérault (river)|Hérault]], and may also be present in the [[Aude (river)|Aude]], drainages.&lt;ref name = FB/&gt; It is absent as a native species from Ireland and Italy but has been introduced to both countries&lt;ref name = CABI&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/117313 | title = Squalius cephalus (European chub)| accessdate = 3 December 2017 | publisher = CABI| work = Invasive Species Compendium}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in Italy ''S. cephalus'' is present and acclimatised since decades, but it seems marginally found here and there (mainly in the Po river basin), never forming well established populations.

==Habitat and ecology==
It is most abundant in small rivers and large streams in the &quot;[[barbel zone]]&quot; where there are riffles and pools. It occurs along the banks of slow-flowing lowland rivers in large lake and even in mountain streams. Chub in lakes undertake spawning migrations into inflowing streams. The adult fish are solitary but the juvenile fish are sociable and occur in shoals. The larvae and juveniles prefer rather shallow habitats along shorelines and these smaller fish have a varied diet of aquatic and terrestrial animals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gutmann Roberts|first1=Catherine|last2=Britton|first2=J.

They feed throughout the year if there are opportunities, even in the coldest days of midwinter.&lt;ref name = Fish-UK/&gt;
[[File:Chub scales.jpg|left|thumb|Scales taken from chub]]
Spawning happens when the water temperature reaches 14&amp;nbsp;°C, and lasts from May to September.&lt;ref name=&quot;CABI&quot; /&gt; They spawn in fast-flowing water above gravel substrates but only infrequently will they spawn among submerged vegetation. The females spawn more than once during a season and each female will mate with several males. The males aggregate at spawning sites and will follow the ripe females, often with much splashing, to shallow riffles. Females lay pale yellow sticky eggs which adhere to the gravel, weed and stones in flowing water.&lt;ref name=&quot;FB&quot; /&gt; Sexual maturity in chub is influenced by environmental factors with males reaching sexual maturity at the age of 2–4 years while females reach it at 4-6 although some individuals may mature much later than this.&lt;ref name=&quot;CABI&quot; /&gt; The fish can live for up to 22 years in the wild&lt;ref name=&quot;TF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.total-fishing.com/chub/ | title = All About Chub| accessdate = 3 December 2017 | publisher = Total Fishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where the age of fish can be assessed through by the number of rings that are visible in scales, these represent seasonal growth patterns.

&lt;br /&gt;

Recent work has shown that chub ingest microplastic particles.

==Fishing for chub==

[[File:Fishing for chub.jpg|left|thumb|Chub caught from the River Teme, Worcestershire]]
They are popular with anglers due to their readiness to feed, and thus to be caught, in almost any conditions. Small chub are freely biting fish which even inexperienced anglers find easy to catch. As they become larger, however, chub become more wary and are easily spooked by noise or visual disturbance.  Consequently, large chub (in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;kg) are keenly sought by anglers who prefer to target specific fish.

The British angling record for chub was broken in May 2007 when Steve White caught a 4.2-kg (9.2-lb) fish from a southern stillwater on a mainline [[Boilies|boilie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishingmagic.com/news/article.asp?UAN=4756&amp;v=1|title=Chub Record Broken - FishingMagic Catch Reports|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229013241/http://www.fishingmagic.com/news/article.asp?UAN=4756&amp;v=1|archivedate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chub can reach a maximum length of 60–80&amp;nbsp;cm (24-31.5&amp;nbsp;in).

===Tackle and tactics===
Smaller chub are not too difficult to catch and on small or medium-sized rivers, a stick-float fishing approach can be adopted or even a swim-feeder and using almost any bait including maggots, luncheon meat, sweetcorn and even small lures and flies. Chub also eat marine derived fishmeal-based pellets and diets of wild chub diets contain 44% of these pellets&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;. Catching the larger specimens however requires a patient and stealthy approach as most larger chub are caught on the smaller, clearer rivers and as a result, the angler must make their presence as subtle as possible and yet again, not a lot of tackle is required and most anglers may even set their tackle up before they get their favored spot as there is less noise from tackle being set up that may disturb the fish. A classic chub spot is just hanging off (or even inside) branches/bushes brushing through the water as chub are quite sensitive to sunlight and most anglers may fish at sunrise or sunset when the chub leave their entangled home. An angler should also look for where the current is being pushed out, causing a re-circulation pattern behind what ever is pushing the current outwards and this is where much food will wash around and where there will probably be feeding fish. Like with the smaller chub, a range of baits can be used but smaller baits such as maggots may attract small fish like minnows (especially on smaller rivers) so a larger bait such as luncheon meat is best used. In terms of the line setup, line ratings of a range of 4-8 pounds breaking-strain is ideal, less experienced anglers should use the tougher rating until they have gained knowledge about 'playing' the fish.

;Feeder/ledger fishing
Traditionally a quiver-tip rod is used with at least four-pound line rating due to the weight of the ledger/feeder (heavier weights need heavier line). In feeder fishing, bait will be put on a hook or a [[hair rig]] and inside a swim-feeder which the current will cause to flow out and attract fish to the hook's position so it involves fishing upstream of where the fish are, this usually involves smaller baits like sweetcorn or maggots. The same applies to ledgering except there is a weight (called a ledger) instead of a swim-feeder and usually heavier baits are used here such as luncheon meat. Another method known as touch-ledgering can be used which involves not using a quiver-tip but instead holding the line that is loose off the reel and feeling for any pulls or the line going loose. Some anglers do this without any weights and let the bait slowly drift downstream with the line steadily moving through their hands, slugs and luncheon meat are excellent for this method.

;Float fishing
This method could involve fishing under the rod-tip in deep water or letting the float gently drift to where the fish may be situated (known as trotting) whilst throwing portions of bait in the stream to encourage feeding. Usually a lighter rod may be used (no more than ten-foot) and sometimes a centrepin reel is used as it allows the line to smoothly come off the reel. Anglers must strike quickly when trotting as bites can be easy to miss sometimes. Drifting baits such as bread, sweetcorn and maggots are usually used here.

;Lure fishing
This method is usually for the larger chub, a light spinning/lure rod with a fixed-spool reel of at least 10 pounds line rating as it is easy to snag onto debris when doing this method. Small lures such as bar-spoons and spoons or even small soft-plastics can imitate the smaller fish such as minnows that the larger chub feed on.

;Fly-fishing
Using flies such as damselfly patterns or even larger, dark patterns such as those that imitate slugs can be very good if presented correctly. More obvious, shiny flies that imitate small fish may work for more aggressive chub, this method is all-year but best in warmer months. Nymph patterns also do well.

A '''low Earth orbit''' ('''LEO''') is an [[geocentric orbit|Earth-centred orbit]] with an [[altitude]] of {{cvt|2000|km|mi}} or less (approximately one-third of the [[Earth radius|radius of Earth]]),&lt;ref name=UNOOSA/&gt; or with at least 11.25 periods per day (an [[orbital period]] of 128 minutes or less) and an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] less than 0.25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.space-track.org/#/recent|title=Current Catalog Files|access-date=July 13, 2018|quote=LEO: Mean Motion &gt; 11.25 &amp; Eccentricity &lt; 0.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the artificial objects in [[outer space]] are in LEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampaio|first=Jarbas|last2=Wnuk|first2=Edwin|last3=Vilhena de Moraes |first3=Rodolpho |last4=Fernandes|first4=Sandro|date=2014-01-01|title=Resonant Orbital Dynamics in LEO Region: Space Debris in Focus |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273597440 |journal=Mathematical Problems in Engineering |volume=2014|page=Figure 1: Histogram of the mean motion of the cataloged objects |doi=10.1155/2014/929810|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellites in this orbit are between 80 and 2000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define LEO in terms of [[altitude]]. The altitude of an object in an [[elliptic orbit]] can vary significantly along the orbit. Even for [[circular orbit]]s, the altitude above ground can vary by as much as {{cvt|30|km|mi}} (especially for [[polar orbit]]s) due to the [[flattening|oblateness]] of [[figure of the Earth|Earth's spheroid figure]] and local [[topography]].  While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous, most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because, according to [[orbital period|Kepler's third law]], this corresponds to a [[semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] of {{cvt|8413|km|mi}}. For circular orbits, this in turn corresponds to an altitude of {{cvt|2042|km|mi}} above the mean radius of Earth, which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions.

The LEO region is defined by some sources as the region in space that LEO orbits occupy.&lt;ref name=UNOOSA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/spacelaw/sd/IADC-2002-01-IADC-Space_Debris-Guidelines-Revision1.pdf|title=IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines|date=September 2007|publisher=INTER-AGENCY SPACE DEBRIS COORDINATION COMMITTEE: Issued by Steering Group and Working Group 4|quote=Region A, Low Earth Orbit (or LEO) Region – spherical region that extends from the Earth's surface up to an altitude (Z) of 2,000 km}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-orbit-58.html|title=What Is an Orbit?|date=2015-06-01|work=NASA|access-date=2018-07-08|others=David Hitt : NASA Educational Technology Services, Alice Wesson : JPL, J.D.

[[sub-orbital spaceflight|Sub-orbital]] objects can also reach the LEO region but are not in an LEO orbit because they [[atmospheric entry|re-enter the atmosphere]]. The distinction between LEO orbits and the LEO region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in LEO but could collide with satellites or debris in LEO orbits.   

All crewed [[space station]]s to date, as well as the majority of [[satellite]]s, have been in LEO.  From 1968 to 1972 the  [[Apollo program]]'s lunar missions sent humans beyond LEO. Since the end of the Apollo program there have been no [[human spaceflight]]s beyond LEO.

==Orbital characteristics==
The mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about {{Cvt|7.8|km/s|kph mph}}, but reduces with increased orbital altitude. Calculated for circular orbit of {{cvt|200|km}} it is {{cvt|7.79|km/s|kph mph}}, and for {{cvt|1500|km}} it is {{cvt|7.12|km/s|kph mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm|title=LEO parameters|website=www.spaceacademy.net.au|access-date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[delta-v]] needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around 9.4&amp;nbsp;km/s. [[Atmospheric drag|Atmospheric]] and [[gravity drag]] associated with launch typically adds {{cvt|1.3|–|1.8|km/s|kph mph}} to the launch vehicle [[delta-v]] required to reach normal LEO orbital velocity of around {{cvt|7.8|km/s|km/h mph|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Spacecraft Fly|last=Swinerd|first=Graham|publisher=Praxis Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0387765723|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orbitalaltitudes.jpg|center|700px]]

The pull of [[gravity]] in LEO is only slightly less than on the Earth's surface. This is because the distance to LEO from the Earth's surface is far less than the Earth's radius. However, an object in orbit is, by definition, in free fall, since there is no force holding it up. As a result objects in orbit, including people, experience a sense of [[weightlessness]], even though they are not actually without weight.

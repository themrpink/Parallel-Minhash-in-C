'''''In the Bedroom''''' is a 2001 American [[independent film|independent]] [[crime film#crime drama|crime drama]] film directed by [[Todd Field]] from a screenplay written by Field and Robert Festinger, based on the 1979 short story &quot;[[Killings (short story)|Killings]]&quot; by [[Andre Dubus]]. It stars [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Nick Stahl]], [[Marisa Tomei]], and [[William Mapother]]. The film centers on the inner dynamics of a family in transition. Matt Fowler (Wilkinson) is a doctor practicing in [[Maine]] and is married to Ruth Fowler (Spacek), a music teacher. Their son Frank (Stahl) is involved in a love affair with an older single mother, Natalie Strout (Tomei). As the beauty of Maine's brief and fleeting summer comes to an end, these characters find themselves in the midst of an unimaginable tragedy.

The title refers to the rear compartment of a [[lobster trap]] known as the &quot;bedroom&quot; and how it can hold only two [[lobster]]s before the lobsters begin to turn on each other. ''In the Bedroom'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was theatrically released in [[limited release|limited theatres]] on November 23, 2001 and grossed $43.4 million against a $1.7 million budget.

The film was praised for Field's direction, its screenplay and the performances (particularly those of Spacek, Wilkinson and Tomei). ''In the Bedroom'' was chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of the year while Spacek's performance was named the best female performance of the year. The film received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[74th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek), [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Wilkinson), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Tomei), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and also three nominations at the [[59th Golden Globe Awards]] including for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]], and winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Drama|Best Actress – Drama]] (for Spacek).

==Plot==
In the Mid-Coast town of [[Camden, Maine]], Matt and Ruth Fowler enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank, a recent college graduate who has come home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with an older woman with children, Natalie Strout.

Frank is about to begin post graduate school for architecture, but is having second thoughts and considering staying in town to continue working as a fisherman and, more importantly, to be near Natalie and her kids. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout, tries to find a way into his ex-wife and children's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie, including assaulting Frank. Ruth is openly concerned about Frank's relationship with Natalie, while Matt thinks it is only a fling. Frank resists Ruth's insistence he report Richard's violence to the police, but neither she nor Matt call them either.

Frank rushes to Natalie's home after receiving a frightened phone call from one of her children. He arrives to find the living room trashed, and Natalie in distress. She tells him Richard just left, and pleads with him not to call the police, but Richard returns almost immediately, still in a rage. Natalie takes the boys upstairs, and Frank insists through the locked front door that Richard leave. He feigns doing so, only to break in through the back door and kill Frank with a handgun.

Though equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways, with Matt putting on a brave face while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. Richard is set free on bail, paid by his well-to-do family, and both Matt and Ruth are forced to see him around town.

The couple retreat with friends Willis and Katie Grinnel to a secluded cottage for a weekend, but Ruth is distant; she rarely contributes to conversation, eyes Matt's drinking suspiciously, and sleeps most of the ride home. The next Saturday, Matt tells Ruth he's going into the office, but he instead goes to the convenience store where Natalie works. The two speak briefly, but Matt begins to become emotional, so he leaves. He goes fishing, and badly cuts his right index finger hauling lobster traps.

The tension between Matt and Ruth increases when their lawyer informs them that the lack of an eyewitness to Frank's shooting means Richard will instead be charged with accidental manslaughter, and will likely only serve five to ten years in prison. Ruth is openly distraught by this, Matt seems deflated. He and Willis spend the evening drinking and lamenting the injustice of the situation.

Natalie approaches Ruth at work and attempts to apologize, but Ruth slaps her before dismissively returning to her papers. Natalie leaves in tears. Later that same day, Ruth accidentally then runs into Richard again while buying cigarettes.

When she returns home, an argument erupts between the couple in which each one confronts and emotionally savages the other. A little girl knocks on the door, interrupting them, and Matt buys $10 worth of chocolate from her. He returns, measured now, and apologizes to Ruth, who apologizes in turn and, breaking down, tells Matt about seeing Natalie and Richard. The two embrace. With the air cleared, the couple is finally able to find common ground in their grief.

Matt then abducts Richard at gunpoint, saying he's arranged for Richard to jump bail and leave the state, so as to spare them the pain of seeing him in Camden. He forces Richard to “pack clothes for warm weather” and plants a train schedule in his apartment. He forces Richard to drive them out to the Grinnel cabin, where Willis is waiting with another vehicle. He begins to load Richard's belongings, but Matt hesitates - and then shoots Richard once in the shoulder and twice in the back, killing him. Willis is shocked, admonishing Matt for not following the plan. Matt responds simply that he couldn't wait. The two successfully bury Richard's body deep in the woods beyond the cabin, but are stuck unexpectedly at a bridge crossing on their return home. Willis laments that this cost them nearly an hour - meaning they arrive back in town just after sunrise at 4:00am instead of in darkness at 3:00am - and Matt apologizes.

Matt returns home and wraps his clothes in an old blanket, before washing himself in the downstairs sink. He returns to the bedroom upstairs to find Ruth awake and smoking in bed. She asks him, &quot;Did you do it?&quot; Matt appears troubled and unresponsive. He climbs into bed and then turns away from her. Finally, Ruth gets up to make coffee. Matt rolls over onto his back and removes the band-aid from the finger he injured hauling traps - his trigger finger - to examine the healing wound underneath. Ruth calls from the kitchen, &quot;Matt, do you want coffee?&quot; Matt doesn't answer.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
[[File:Tom &amp; Sissy.jpg|thumb|Wilkinson and Spacek received widespread acclaim for their performances as the bereaved parents.]]
Upon its release, the film received critical acclaim for its direction, script, and performances, notably Wilkinson and Spacek. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a &quot;certified fresh&quot; approval rating of 93% based on 138 reviews, with an average score of 7.91/10. The site's consensus states &quot;Expertly crafted and performed, ''In the Bedroom'' is a quietly wrenching portrayal of grief.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rotten&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_bedroom/ |title=''In the Bedroom'' |accessdate=2020-04-12 |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= In the Bedroom |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-bedroom |website= [[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] of ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' wrote on his review that it is the &quot;best movie of the last several years&quot; and described it &quot;the most evocative, the most mysterious, the most inconsolably devastating&quot; film. He further mentioned that the effect of the film &quot;isn't over when you leave the theater&quot; and that it's &quot;always going to be there&quot;. He also called ''In the Bedroom'' a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Edelstein |first=David|title= In the Thrall|work=[[Slate Magazine]]|date= 23 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Norman]] of ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' stated that &quot;...Field has not only studied the masters of cinematic understatement, such as [[Yasujirō Ozu|Ozu]] and [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], but that he fully understands their processes... Field's achievement is such a perfectly consummated marriage of intent and execution that he need never make another movie. I would not be alone, I think, in hoping he will make many more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Norman, Neil|title= A fatal summer affair|work= [[The Evening Standard]]|date= January 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' compared Field's direction to  [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]'s, saying that it &quot;manages to feel both highly controlled and effortlessly spontaneous at the same time; and his lifting of the facade of this picturesque, Norman Rockwell setting is carried out with surgical precision&quot;. He further mentioned that &quot;like Kubrick, Field doesn't make any moral judgments about his characters, and his film remains stubbornly enigmatic. It can be read as a high-class revenge thriller, an ode to the futility of vengeance or almost anything in between.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Arnold |first=William|title= Pulling Back the Covers on an Idyllic Life |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date= 25 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stated on his review that it is &quot;one of the best-directed films of the year&quot; and that &quot;every performance has a perfect tone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=In the Bedroom|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-the-bedroom-2001|website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He listed ''In the Bedroom'' as his third best film of the year 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert Top 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Roger Ebert Top 10 List|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/ebert.html|website=Alumnus.caltech.edu|accessdate=25 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231063216/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/ebert.html|archive-date=31 December 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stones]]''' [[Peter Travers]] called the film &quot;an uncommonly good movie&quot; that &quot;will hit you hard.&quot; He also mentioned that &quot;[[Academy Awards|Oscar]] would be a fool&quot; if it ignores Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson's &quot;career-crowning performances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travers Review&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Travers|first=Peter|title=In the Bedroom|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/in-the-bedroom-20011113|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] included the film in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' essay &quot;''The most important films of the past decade — and why they mattered''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15FOB-wwln-t.html|title=Screen Memories|first=A. O.|last=Scott|date=12 November 2009|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In the Bedroom'' was also chosen by the New York Times Film Critics for their &quot;''Best 1,000 Films of All Time''.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;NYT In the Bedroom Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=NYT In the Bedroom Overview|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/237127/In-the-Bedroom/overview|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February 2020 issue of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' lists ''In the Bedroom'' alongside ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', ''[[Dr, Strangelove]]'', ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', ''[[The Conversation]]'', ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', and ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' as &quot;''The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars'.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-oscar-best-picture-losers.html|magazine=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=2020-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the negative reviews of the film include Paul Tatara of the ''[[CNN]]'' mentioning that the film &quot;flounders&quot; despite the good performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatara Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Tatara|first=Paul|title='Bedroom' well-performed, but severe  Dreadful atmosphere|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/23/review.in.the.bedroom/index.html|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Hunter of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said &quot;it opens brilliantly&quot; but goes on to &quot;self-negating absurdity.&quot;

===Sundance===
''In the Bedroom'' was the first official [[Sundance Film Festival]] film to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture including three more nominations for acting and an adapted screenplay nomination. It received the most nominations of any film that premiered at Sundance until ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sundance at the Oscars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Turitz|first=Neil|title=Sundance at the Oscars|url=http://www.studiosystemnews.com/sundance-at-the-oscars-the-films-that-crossed-over-from-park-city-to-hollywood/|publisher=Studio System News|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''In the Bedroom'' was the second highest-grossing film that premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] from 2000 to 2009, after ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/b.o._of_the_00s_the_top_grossing_sundance_films/Top|title=Ten Grossers At Sundance this Decade|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed a worldwide total of $43,368,779.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|inthebedroom|In the Bedroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to become, at the time, the highest-grossing non-[[IMAX]] film in history never to reach the top 10 in a given week, and also one of the most successful films in history, with an expense-to-profit ratio of 1:25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/never1.htm?page=never10&amp;p=.htm|title=Top Grossing Movies That Never Hit the Top 10 at the Box Office|website=Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===

A Blu-ray for this title does not exist. The only DVD available is a bare-bones edition containing no extras or director's commentary. In 2002 when Field was asked by the [[New York Times]] why this was the case he said &quot;Once a film is made available to the public, the right of interpretation belongs to the viewer. Unless it's something historical -- like ''Citizen Kane'' or ''[[Raging Bull]]'' -- it seems really silly to have that kind of thing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/movies/home-video-in-the-bedroom-without-frills.html|title=In the Bedroom Without the Frills|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=27 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===

During season four (episode eight &quot;Mergers and Acquisitions&quot;) of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', Tony shows Carmela the new media center he has installed in the pool house, and she replies that she will pick up ''In the Bedroom'' for them to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mergers_and_Acquisitions_(The_Sopranos)&amp;gettingStartedReturn=true|title=Mergers and Acquisitions (The Sporanos)|website=Wikipedia.org|accessdate=27 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

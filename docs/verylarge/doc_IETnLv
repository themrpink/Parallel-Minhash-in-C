'''NoCGV ''Svalbard''''' (W303) is a [[Norwegian Coast Guard]] [[icebreaker]] and [[offshore patrol vessel]] constructed by [[Langsten AS]] at [[Tangen Verft]] shipyard in [[Kragerø]] and launched on 17 February 2001. She was named 15 December in [[Tomrefjord]] with Minister of Defence [[Kristin Krohn Devold]] as godmother, and delivered to the Coast Guard on 18 January 2002. She entered service in mid-2002 and is homeported in [[Sortland]]. Her primary operating area is in the Arctic waters north of [[Norway]], the [[Barents Sea]] and around the [[Svalbard]] islands. 

''Svalbard'' is the second largest ship in Norway's military armed forces (by tonnage), designed to supplement the three other helicopter-carrying ships of the Norwegian Coast Guard - the {{sclass-|Nordkapp|offshore patrol vessel|1}}s. She is [[NBC protection system|NBC-protected]] with constant overpressure, and is capable of icebreaking and emergency towing up to 100,000 tons. The Norwegian coastline is generally free of ice, thus ''Svalbard'' is the only active Norwegian icebreaking-capable vessel. A [[double acting ship]], ''Svalbard'' is designed to break ice both ahead and astern.

==Career==
{{expand-section|date=November 2020}}

On 21 August 2019, ''Svalbard'' became the first Norwegian ship to reach the North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2019/08/norwegian-coast-guard-vessel-reach-north-pole|title=Norwegian Coast Guard vessel reaches North Pole|publisher=The Independent Barents Observer|date=21 August 2019|accessdate=21 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2020, ''Svalbard'' was deployed to the [[Bering Sea]] to retrieve scientific instruments belonging to the [[Coordinated Arctic Acoustic Thermometry Experiment]] (CAATEX) from the seabed, a task previously assigned to the [[United States Coast Guard]] icebreaker [[USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)|USCGC ''Healy'']] that had been sidelined earlier that year following an onboard fire. The vessel sailed to the western hemisphere along a high-latitude route north of Svalbard and [[Franz Josef Land]], and outside of Russian territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2020/10/norwegian-coast-guard-ship-sails-high-latitude-arctic-transit-voyage-beaufort-sea|title=Norwegian Coast Guard sails high-latitude Arctic voyage to Beaufort Sea|publisher=The Barents Observer|date=27 October 2020|accessdate=14 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the scientific mission, a number of Russian media outlets interpreted this voyage as an &quot;intrusion&quot; to the Russian Arctic by an &quot;armed NATO warship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2020/10/prigozhins-troll-media-sham-norwegian-intrusion-russian-arctic|title=How a Barents Observer story is misused by troll media to sham a Norwegian &quot;intrusion&quot; into the Russian Arctic|publisher=The Barents Observer|date=30 October 2020|accessdate=14 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2007 the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] had announced that [[Canada]] would be building six to eight [[Harry DeWolf-class offshore patrol vessel|arctic offshore patrol ships]] (AOPS) for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN), modeled after ''Svalbard''{{'}}s design.&lt;ref name=Cbc20070709&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels have been modified to meet the needs of the Canadian Navy. Some of the modifications include: increasing the ships' ice breaking capabilities, adding a larger and fully enclosed forecastle/cable deck for greater arctic protection, addition of a multipurpose operational space, updated command and control systems, an updated sensor suite, and an extended hangar for the larger Sikorsky [[CH-148 Cyclone]] helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy-marine.forces.gc.ca/en/fleet-units/aops-home.page |title=Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships |publisher=Royal Canadian Navy |date=January 2015 |accessdate=9 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031134820/http://www.navy-marine.forces.gc.ca/en/fleet-units/aops-home.page |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been criticized for its high costs. For example, [[Irving Shipbuilding]] was awarded a CAD$288 million design contract for the vessel while the design of ''Svalbard'' and similar patrol ships within other countries paid less than one-tenth as much.&lt;ref name=250milMystery&gt;{{cite news |work= CBC News |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/05/02/pol-milewski-shipbuilding-design-mystery.html |title= Shipbuilding contract holds $250M mystery |first=Terry |last=Milewski |date= 2 May 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first ship in its class, {{HMCS|Harry DeWolf}}, was delivered to the RCN on 31 July 2020 with its commissioning anticipated in mid-2021 following the completion of post-acceptance sea trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-navy-enters-new-era-by-welcoming-long-awaited-arctic-warship/?fbclid=IwAR2Jv4x3csjORFnAODkKAnICAJH1Ch_iWo-OFl_LQNY41s_fMagYmdhtP_I |title=Canadian Navy enters new era by welcoming long awaited arctic warship |work=The Globe and Mail |date=31 July 2020 |access-date=31 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/first-arctic-and-offshore-patrol-ship-delivered-to-royal-canadian-navy |title=First Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ship Delivered to Royal Canadian Navy |work=maritime-executive.com |date=31 July 2020 |access-date=10 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Russia]] started constructing the first of several vessels in its [[Project 23550 patrol ship|Project 23550]].&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurity23550/&gt; Think tank [[Global Security]] pointed out these vessels are almost the same length, displacement, power and endurance as the ''Svalbard'' class.  They will also be able to travel through roughly the same depth of ice. The Russian vessels will be more heavily armed, with a {{convert|76|or|100|mm|abbr=on}} main cannon, an anti-missile gatling gun, and launchers for eight cruise missiles.

The '''cilium''' ({{ety|la||[[eyelash]]}};&lt;ref&gt;Mosby’s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; the plural is '''cilia''') is an [[organelle]] found on eukaryotic cells in the shape of a slender protuberance that projects from the much larger [[Cell (biology)|cell body]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HHMIB2005&quot;/&gt;

There are two types of cilia: ''motile'' and ''non-motile'' cilia. Non-motile cilia are also called ''primary cilia'' which serve as sensory organelles. Most mammalian cell types possess a single non-motile, primary cilium, which functions as a cellular antenna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singla 629–633&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Singla|first1=Veena|last2=Reiter|first2=Jeremy F.|date=2006-08-04|title=The primary cilium as the cell's antenna: signaling at a sensory organelle|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16888132|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5787|pages=629–633|doi=10.1126/science.1124534|issn=1095-9203|pmid=16888132|bibcode=2006Sci...313..629S|s2cid=29885142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pazour|first1=Gregory J.|last2=Witman|first2=George B.|date=February 2003|title=The vertebrate primary cilium is a sensory organelle|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12517711|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=105–110|doi=10.1016/s0955-0674(02)00012-1|issn=0955-0674|pmid=12517711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions include olfactory neurons which possess several non-motile cilia and cells of the transient [[Primitive node|embryonic node]], which possess singular motile cilia known as ''nodal cilia'', critical for the establishment of left to right body asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Horani&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Horani|first1=A|last2=Ferkol|first2=T|date=May 2018|title=Advances in the Genetics of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia|journal=Chest|volume=154|issue=3|pages=645–652|pmid=29800551|pmc=6130327|doi=10.1016/j.chest.2018.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eukaryotes, motile cilia and [[flagellum|flagella]] (together known as [[undulipodium|undulipodia)]] are structurally similar, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function or length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haimo_JCB198112&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Haimo LT, Rosenbaum JL|date=December 1981|title=Cilia, flagella, and microtubules|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=91|issue=3 Pt 2|pages=125s–130s|doi=10.1083/jcb.91.3.125s|pmc=2112827|pmid=6459327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=db2004&gt;

==Types==
===Primary cilia===
In animals, non-motile '''primary cilia''' are found on nearly every type of cell, blood cells being a prominent exception.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHMIB2005&quot;/&gt; Most cells only possess one, in contrast to cells with motile cilia, an exception being [[Olfactory epithelium#Olfactory sensory neurons|olfactory sensory neurons]], where the [[odorant receptors]] are located, which each possess about ten cilia. Some cell types, such as retinal photoreceptor cells, possess highly specialized primary cilia.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, U., &amp; Schmitt, A. (2000).

The cilium is composed of subdomains{{what|date=October 2020}} and enclosed by a plasma membrane continuous with the plasma membrane of the cell. For many cilia, the basal body, where the cilium originates, is located within a membrane invagination called the ciliary pocket. The cilium membrane and the basal body microtubules are connected by distal appendages (also called transition fibers). Vesicles carrying molecules for the cilia dock at the distal appendages. Distal to the transition fibers form a transition zone where entry and exit of molecules is regulated to and from the cilia.

===Motile cilia===
Larger eukaryotes, such as mammals, have '''motile cilia''' as well. Motile cilia are usually present on a cell's surface in large numbers and beat in coordinated waves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Lewin|title=Cells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VEGC8j9g9wC&amp;pg=PA359|year=2007|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-3905-8|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functioning of motile cilia is strongly dependent on the maintenance of optimal levels of periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. Epithelial sodium channels [[ENaC]] that are specifically expressed along the entire length of cilia apparently serve as sensors that regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012-Enuka&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2016-Hanukoglu&quot; &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Hanukoglu A | title = Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) family: Phylogeny, structure-function, tissue distribution, and associated inherited diseases | journal = Gene | volume = 579 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–132 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26772908 | pmc = 4756657 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ciliate]]s are microscopic organisms that possess ''motile'' cilia exclusively and use them for either locomotion or to simply move liquid over their surface.

===Nodal cilia===
'''Nodal cilia''' are only present in the early [[embryonic development|developing embryo]].&lt;ref name=Horani/&gt; The nodal cilium is of similar structure to the primitive cilium in having no central apparatus but it does possess [[dynein arm]]s that enable it to move or spin in a circular direction. The spin is clockwise and this causes a flow of extraembryonic fluid to move across the [[primitive node|nodal]] surface directed to the left. Primary cilia around the nodal cilia sense the directional flow which activates [[nodal signaling pathway|nodal signaling]], establishing left to right sidedness.&lt;ref name=Horani/&gt;

== Structure==
[[File:Eukaryotic cilium diagram en.svg|thumb|300px|Eukaryotic motile cilium]]
Inside cilia and [[flagella]] is a [[microtubule]]-based [[cytoskeleton]] called the [[axoneme]].  The axoneme of a primary cilium typically has a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets (called a [[Axoneme#Structure|9+0 axoneme]]),  and the axoneme of a motile cilium has, in addition to the nine outer doublets,  two central microtubule singlets (called a [[Axoneme#Structure|9+2 axoneme]]).  The axoneme acts as a scaffold for axonemal inner and outer dynein arms that move motile cilia, and provides tracks for [[molecular machine|molecular motor]] proteins, such as [[kinesin|Kinesin II]], that carry proteins along the length of the cilium through a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT).&lt;ref name=&quot;HHMIB2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenbaum JL, Witman GB | title = Intraflagellar transport | journal = Nature Reviews.

The foundation of the cilium is the basal body, a term applied to  the mother centriole when it is associated with a cilium. Mammalian basal bodies consist of a barrel of nine triplet microtubules, subdistal appendages and nine strut-like structures, known as distal appendages, which attach the basal body to the membrane at the base of the cilium. Two of the basal body's triplet microtubules extend to become the doublet microtubules of the ciliary axoneme.

===Ciliary rootlet===
The ciliary rootlet is a cytoskeleton-like structure that originates from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. Rootlets are typically 80-100&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter and contain cross striae distributed at regular intervals of approximately 55-70&amp;nbsp;nm. A prominent component of the rootlet is R[[CROCC|ootletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ciliary Rootlet|url=http://amigo.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/amigo/term-assoc.cgi?gptype=all&amp;speciesdb=all&amp;taxid=9606&amp;evcode=all&amp;term_assocs=all&amp;term=GO%3A0035253&amp;action=filter|work=Gene Ontology|access-date=13 June 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition zone===
To achieve its distinct composition, the proximal-most region of the cilium consists of a transition zone that controls which proteins can enter and leave the cilium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Galo|last2=Raleigh|first2=David R.|last3=Reiter|first3=Jeremy F.|date=23 April 2018|title=How the Ciliary Membrane Is Organized Inside-Out to Communicate Outside-In|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29689227|journal=Current Biology|volume=28|issue=8|pages=R421–R434|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.010|issn=1879-0445|pmc=6434934|pmid=29689227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Garcia-Gonzalo|first1=Francesc R.|last2=Reiter|first2=Jeremy F.|date=2017-02-01|title=Open Sesame: How Transition Fibers and the Transition Zone Control Ciliary Composition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770015|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=9|issue=2|pages=a028134|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a028134|issn=1943-0264|pmc=5287074|pmid=27770015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gonçalves|first1=João|last2=Pelletier|first2=Laurence|date=April 2017|title=The Ciliary Transition Zone: Finding the Pieces and Assembling the Gate|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28401750|journal=Molecules and Cells|volume=40|issue=4|pages=243–253|doi=10.14348/molcells.2017.0054|issn=0219-1032|pmc=5424270|pmid=28401750}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the transition zone, Y-shaped structures connect the ciliary membrane to the underlying axoneme. Control of selective entry into cilia may involve a sieve-like function of transition zone. Inherited defects in components of the transition zone cause ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome. Transition zone structure and function is conserved across diverse organisms, including vertebrates, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In mammals, disruption of the transition zone reduces the ciliary abundance of membrane-associated ciliary proteins, such as those involved in Hedgehog signal transduction, compromising Hedgehog-dependent embryonic development of digit number and central nervous system patterning.

===Cilia versus flagella===
Though they have been given different names, motile cilia and flagella have nearly identical structures and have the same purpose: motion. The movement of the appendage can be described as a wave. The wave tends to originate from the cilium base and can be described in terms of frequency (ciliary beat frequency or CBF), amplitude and wave length. The beating motion is created by dynein arm structures the sliding of outer doublets, and originates in the axoneme, not at the basal body. A key difference between the two structures is that in a eukaryotic organism such as humans, flagella are used to propel the cell, while cilia are used to move substances across a surface. An example of each would be the flagellum present on a sperm cell and the cilium on the epithelial tissue of the lungs that clears out foreign particles. Motile cilia and flagella possess the same [[Axoneme#Structure|9+2 axoneme]] structure. The 9 indicates the number of doublets present around the outer edge of the appendage while the 2 refers to a central pair of independent microtubules. In primary and other non-motile cilia, the axoneme lacks a central pair, resulting in a [[Axoneme#Structure|9+0 axoneme]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foi A, Salvo FD, Doctorovich F, Huck-Iriart C, Ramallo-López JM, Dürr M, Ivanović-Burmazović I, Stirnat K, Garbe S, Klein A | title = Synthesis and structural characterisation of unprecedented primary N-nitrosamines coordinated to iridium(iv) | journal = Dalton Transactions | volume = 47 | issue = 33 | pages = 11445–54 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30065990 | doi = 10.1042/BCJ20170453 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cilium production==
Cilia are formed through the process of [[ciliogenesis]]. An early step is docking of the basal body to the growing ciliary membrane, after which the transition zone forms. The building blocks of the ciliary axoneme, such as [[tubulins]], are added at the ciliary tips through a process that depends partly on [[intraflagellar transport]] (IFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson KA, Rosenbaum JL | title = Polarity of flagellar assembly in Chlamydomonas | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 119 | issue = 6 | pages = 1605–11 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1281816 | pmc = 2289744 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.119.6.1605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hao L, Thein M, Brust-Mascher I, Civelekoglu-Scholey G, Lu Y, Acar S, Prevo B, Shaham S, Scholey JM | title = Intraflagellar transport delivers tubulin isotypes to sensory cilium middle and distal segments | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 790–98 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21642982 | pmc = 3129367 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions include Drosophila sperm and ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' flagella formation, in which cilia assemble in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/06/of_cilia_and_si.html Of cilia and silliness (more on Behe) – The Panda's Thumb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161257/http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/06/of_cilia_and_si.html |date=17 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, the cilium is a [[Molecular machine|nanomachine]] composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines.  [[Flexible linker]]s allow the 
[[Protein domain#Domains and protein flexibility|mobile protein domains]]
connected by them to recruit their binding partners and induce 
long-range [[allostery]] via 
[[Protein dynamics#Global flexibility: multiple domains|protein domain dynamics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Satir2008&quot;/&gt;

== Function ==
The [[dynein]] in the axoneme forms bridges between neighbouring microtubule doublets. When ATP activates the motor domain of dynein, it attempts to walk along the adjoining microtubule doublet. This would force the adjacent doublets to slide over one another if not for the presence of [[Nexin]] between the microtubule doublets. And thus the force generated by dynein is instead converted into a bending motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26888/|title = Molecular Biology of the Cell|last = Alberts|first = Bruce|year = 2002}}{{ISBN?}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensing the extracellular environment===
Some primary cilia on [[epithelial]] cells in eukaryotes act as ''cellular antennae'', providing [[Molecular sensor|chemosensation]], [[thermosensation]] and [[mechanosensation]] of the extracellular environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singla 629–633&quot;/&gt; These cilia then play a role in mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a [[Secretion|secretory]] role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are [[Motility|motile]].&lt;ref name=Adams2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams M, Smith UM, Logan CV, Johnson CA | title = Recent advances in the molecular pathology, cell biology and genetics of ciliopathies | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–67 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18178628 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.2007.054999 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[epithelial]] cells are ciliated, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarized cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

This leftward movement is used by the mouse embryo to generate left-right asymmetry across the midline of the embryo.

Ciliary defects can lead to a number of human diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiter 533–547&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Daniela A.|last2=Hildebrandt|first2=Friedhelm|date=2017-03-01|title=Ciliopathies|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793968|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=a028191|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a028191|issn=1943-0264|pmc=5334254|pmid=27793968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic mutations compromising the proper functioning of cilia, [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]], can cause chronic disorders such as [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]] (PCD), [[nephronophthisis]] or [[Senior–Løken syndrome]]. In addition, a defect of the primary cilium in the [[Nephron#Renal tubule|renal tubule]] cells can lead to [[polycystic kidney disease]] (PKD). In another genetic disorder called [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]] (BBS), the mutant gene products are the components in the basal body and cilia.&lt;ref name=&quot;badano2006&quot;/&gt;

Lack of functional cilia in the [[fallopian tube]]s can cause [[ectopic pregnancy]]. A fertilized [[ovum]] may not reach the [[uterus]] if the cilia are unable to move it there. In such a case, the ovum will implant in the fallopian tubes, causing a [[tubal pregnancy]], the most common form of ectopic pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horne AW, Critchley HO | title = Mechanisms of disease: the endocrinology of ectopic pregnancy | journal = Expert Reviews in Molecular Medicine | volume = 14 | pages = e7 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22380790 | doi = 10.1017/erm.2011.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, epithelial sodium channels [[ENaC]] that are expressed along the length of cilia regulate fluid level surrounding the cilia. Mutations that decrease the activity of ENaC result in multisystem [[pseudohypoaldosteronism]], that is associated with fertility problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012-Enuka&quot; /&gt; In [[cystic fibrosis]] that results from mutations in the chloride channel [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR]], ENaC activity is enhanced leading to a severe reduction of the fluid level that causes complications and infections in the respiratory airways.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016-Hanukoglu&quot; /&gt;

Since the flagellum of human sperm is actually a modified cilium, ciliary dysfunction can also be responsible for male infertility.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16850538&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ichioka K, Kohei N, Okubo K, Nishiyama H, Terai A | title = Obstructive azoospermia associated with chronic sinopulmonary infection and situs inversus totalis | journal = Urology | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 204.e5–7 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16850538 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2006.01.072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of interest, there is an association of primary ciliary dyskinesia with left-right anatomic abnormalities such as [[situs inversus]] (a combination of findings known as [[Kartagener's syndrome]]) and other heterotaxic defects. These left-right anatomic abnormalities can also result in [[congenital heart disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17515466&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy MP, Omran H, Leigh MW, Dell S, Morgan L, Molina PL, Robinson BV, Minnix SL, Olbrich H, Severin T, Ahrens P, Lange L, Morillas HN, Noone PG, Zariwala MA, Knowles MR | title = Congenital heart disease and other heterotaxic defects in a large cohort of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia | journal = Circulation | volume = 115 | issue = 22 | pages = 2814–21 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17515466 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.649038 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that proper cilial function is responsible for the normal left-right asymmetry in mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12888012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGrath J, Brueckner M | title = Cilia are at the heart of vertebrate left-right asymmetry | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–92 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12888012 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(03)00091-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ciliopathies as exemplars of multi-organ inherited diseases===
Early 2000s findings in genetic research have suggested that many [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously related in the medical literature, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|root cause]] of the widely varying set of medical [[phenotype|symptoms]] that are clinically visible in the [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]]. These have been grouped as an [[emergence|emerging]] class of diseases called [[ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary/immotile cilia, [[organelle]]s which are present in many diverse cellular types throughout the [[human]] body.

Cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical signaling pathways essential to embryonic development and adult physiology, and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often [[pleiotropic|multi-symptom]] nature of diverse ciliopathies.&lt;ref name=&quot;badano2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiter 533–547&quot; /&gt; Known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alström syndrome]], [[Meckel–Gruber syndrome]], [[Sensenbrenner syndrome]] and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;badano2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2008/&gt;

The diverse outcomes caused by ciliary dysfunction may result from alleles of different strengths that compromise ciliary functions in different ways or to different extents. Many ciliopathies are inherited in a Mendelian manner, but specific genetic interactions between distinct functional ciliary complexes, such as transition zone and BBS complexes, can alter the phenotypic manifestations of recessive ciliopathies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Leitch|first1=Carmen C.|last2=Zaghloul|first2=Norann A.|last3=Davis|first3=Erica E.|last4=Stoetzel|first4=Corinne|last5=Diaz-Font|first5=Anna|last6=Rix|first6=Suzanne|last7=Alfadhel|first7=Majid|last8=Al-Fadhel|first8=Majid|last9=Lewis|first9=Richard Alan|last10=Eyaid|first10=Wafaa|last11=Banin|first11=Eyal|date=April 2008|title=Hypomorphic mutations in syndromic encephalocele genes are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18327255|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=40|issue=4|pages=443–448|doi=10.1038/ng.97|issn=1546-1718|pmid=18327255|s2cid=5282929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yee|first1=Laura E.|last2=Garcia-Gonzalo|first2=Francesc R.|last3=Bowie|first3=Rachel V.|last4=Li|first4=Chunmei|last5=Kennedy|first5=Julie K.|last6=Ashrafi|first6=Kaveh|last7=Blacque|first7=Oliver E.|last8=Leroux|first8=Michel R.|last9=Reiter|first9=Jeremy F.|date=November 2015|title=Conserved Genetic Interactions between Ciliopathy Complexes Cooperatively Support Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Signaling|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26540106|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e1005627|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005627|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4635004|pmid=26540106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular changes===
Reduction of cilia function can also result from infection. Research into [[biofilm]]s has been increasing and has shown how bacteria can alter cilia. A biofilm is a community of bacteria of either the same or multiple species of bacteria. The cluster of cells secretes different factors which form an extracellular matrix. Cilia in the respiratory system is known to move mucus and pathogens out of the airways. It has been found that patients with biofilm positive infections have impaired cilia function. The impairment may present as decreased motion or reduction in the number of cilia. Though these changes result from an external source, they still effect the pathogenicity of the bacteria, progression of infection, and how it is treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fastenberg JH, Hsueh WD, Mustafa A, Akbar NA, Abuzeid WM | title = Biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis: Pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies | journal = World Journal of Otorhinolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 219–29 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 29204570 | pmc = 5698538 | doi = 10.1016/j.wjorl.2016.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breakbeat hardcore''' (also referred to as '''hardcore rave''') is a [[music genre]] of the very early [[1990s]] that spawned from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[rave]] scene. It combines [[Four-on-the-floor (dance)|four-on-the-floor]] rhythms with [[breakbeat]]s usually [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. In addition to the inclusion of breakbeats, the genre also features shuffled [[drum machine]] patterns, [[hoover sound|hoover]] and other noises originating from [[new beat]], [[acid house]] squelches and [[Beep (sound)|bleeps]], and often upbeat [[house music|house]] piano rolls and vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Reynolds|first = Simon|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|year = 1998|publisher = Picador|quote = 1990 also saw the genesis of a distinctively British rave sound, 'hard core', which decisively broke with the mould of Detroit and Chicago, and ended the dependency on American imports. By 1991 this underground sound - actually a confederacy of hybrid genres and regional styles - was assaulting the mainstream pop charts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Rave}}
[[File:Fantazia Summertime Rave.jpg|thumb|Fantazia Summertime rave, May 1992]]
The [[rave]] scene expanded rapidly in the very early [[1990s in music|1990s]], both at [[Nightclub|clubs]] up and down the country including [[Labrynth (club)|Labrynth]], [[Shelley's Laserdome]], [[The Eclipse (club)|The Eclipse]], and [[Sanctuary Music Arena]], and large raves in [[Warehouse|warehouses]] and in the open air attracting 20–50,000 whether put on legally from promoters such as [[Fantazia (rave music promoter)|Fantazia]] and [[Raindance (rave music promoter)|Raindance]], or unlicensed by [[free party]] [[Sound system (DJ)|sound systems]] such as [[Spiral Tribe]]. Breakbeat hardcore drew its melting pot of sound from a vast array of influences - from the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[new beat]] sound that had for a short period been prominent in the UK [[rave music|rave]] scene, to [[house music|house]] and [[acid house]], and furthermore drawing on [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[reggae]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Reynolds|first = Simon|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|year = 1998|publisher = Picador|quote = Influenced by reggae and hip hop, hardcore producers intensified the sub-bass frequencies, used looped breakbeats to funk up house's four-to-the-floor machine-beat, and embraced sampling with deranged glee. Following the lead of the bombastic Belgians and Germans, UK producers deployed riff-like 'stabs' and bursts of glaring noise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Reynolds|first = Simon|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|year = 1998|publisher = Picador|quote = Between 1990 and 1993, hardcore in Britain referred by turns to the Northern bleep-and-bass sound of Warp and Unique 3, to the hip-house and ragga-techno sounds of the Shut Up And Dance label, to the anthemic pop-rave of acts like N-Joi and Shades of Rhythm, to Belgian and German brutalist techno, and, finally to the breakbeat-driven furore of hardcore jungle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

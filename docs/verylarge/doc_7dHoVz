===Respiratory systems===
These depend on individual sub-groups' environments. Modern terrestrial chelicerates generally have both [[book lung]]s, which deliver oxygen and remove waste gases via the blood, and [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]], which do the same without using the blood as a transport system.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=559–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; The living [[horseshoe crab]]s are aquatic and have [[book gill]]s that lie in a horizontal plane. For a long time it was assumed that the extinct [[eurypterid]]s had gills, but the fossil evidence was ambiguous. However, a fossil of the {{convert|45|mm|in}} long eurypterid ''[[Onychopterella]]'', from the Late [[Ordovician]] period, has what appear to be four pairs of vertically oriented book gills whose internal structure is very similar to that of scorpions' book lungs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BraddyAldridgeEtAl1999LamellateBookGills&quot;&gt;{{citation |author1=Braddy, S.J. |author2=Aldridge, R.J. |author3=Gabbott, S.E. |author4=Theron, J.N. |name-list-style=amp |year=1999 |title=Lamellate book-gills in a late Ordovician eurypterid from the Soom Shale, South Africa: Support for a eurypterid-scorpion clade |journal=[[Lethaia]] |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=72–74 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1999.tb00582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feeding and digestion===
The guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow to take solid food.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt; All [[scorpion]]s and almost all [[spider]]s are [[predator]]s that &quot;pre-process&quot; food in preoral cavities formed by the [[chelicera]]e and the bases of the [[pedipalp]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Spiders&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Scorpions&quot; /&gt; However, one predominantly [[herbivore]] spider species is known,&lt;ref name=&quot;MeehanOlsonCurry2008VegetarianJumpingSpider&quot;&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Meehan, C.J. |author2=Olson, E.J. |author3=Curry, R.L. |date=21 August 2008 |title=Exploitation of the Pseudomyrmex–Acacia mutualism by a predominantly vegetarian jumping spider (''Bagheera kiplingi'') |conference=93rd ESA Annual Meeting |url=http://eco.confex.com/eco/2008/techprogram/P12401.HTM | access-date=2008-10-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many supplement their diets with [[nectar]] and [[pollen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2001&quot;&gt;{{citation |author=Jackson, R.R. |year=2001 |title=Jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) that feed on nectar |journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=255 |pages=25–29 |url=http://xnelson.googlepages.com/Jacksonetal2001.pdf |doi=10.1017/S095283690100108X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Acari]] (ticks and mites) are blood-sucking [[parasite]]s, but there are many predatory, herbivore and [[scavenger]] sub-groups. All the Acari have a retractable feeding assembly that consists of the chelicerae, pedipalps and parts of the [[exoskeleton]], and which forms a preoral cavity for pre-processing food.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Acari&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=591–595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvestmen]] are among the minority of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Opiliones&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=588–590}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horseshoe crab]]s are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, which is on the underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed [[gnathobase]]s that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Xiphosura&quot; /&gt; This is how the earliest [[arthropod]]s are thought to have fed.&lt;ref name=&quot;WonderfulLifeP105&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |location=New York, NY |publisher=W.W.

===Excretion===
Horseshoe crabs convert [[nitrogen]]ous wastes to [[ammonia]] and dump it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as [[feces]] via the [[anus]]. They also have [[nephridia]] (&quot;little kidneys&quot;), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Xiphosura&quot; /&gt; Ammonia is so toxic that it must be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=529–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and [[Malpighian tubules]]. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved [[convergent evolution|independently]] in [[insect]]s and several groups of [[arachnid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt;

Chelicerate nervous systems are based on the standard arthropod model of a pair of [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cord]]s, each with a [[ganglion]] per segment, and a [[arthropod brain|brain]] formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=531–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ChelicerataGen&quot; /&gt; However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mittmann, B. |author2=Scholtz, G. |year=2003 |title=Development of the nervous system in the &quot;head&quot; of Limulus polyphemus (Chelicerata: Xiphosura): Morphological evidence for a correspondence between the segments of the chelicerae and of the (first) antennae of Mandibulata |journal=[[Dev Genes Evol]] |volume=213 |issue=1 |pages=9–17 |doi=10.1007/s00427-002-0285-5 |pmid=12590348 |s2cid=13101102 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

There is a notable but variable trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain. The brains of [[horseshoe crabs]] include all the ganglia of the [[prosoma]] plus those of the first two opisthosomal segments, while the other opisthosomal segments retain separate pairs of ganglia.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Xiphosura&quot; /&gt; In most living [[arachnid]]s, except [[scorpion]]s if they are true arachnids, ''all'' the ganglia, including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt; However, in the [[Mesothelae]], which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused,&lt;ref name=&quot;CoddingtonLevi1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coddington, J.A. |author2=Levi, H.W. |s2cid=55647804 |year=1991 |title=Systematics and Evolution of Spiders (Araneae) |journal=[[Annu.

Syst.]] |volume=22 |pages=565–592 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.003025}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in scorpions the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt;

===Senses===
As with other arthropods, chelicerates' [[cuticle]]s would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=532–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living chelicerates have both [[compound eye]]s (only in [[horseshoe crab]]s, as the compound eye in the other clades has been reduced to a cluster of no more than five pairs of [[ocelli]]), mounted on the sides of the head, plus pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=4450993 | pmid=26034575 | doi=10.1186/s13227-015-0010-x | volume=6 | title=Differential expression of retinal determination genes in the principal and secondary eyes of Cupiennius salei Keyserling (1877) | journal=Evodevo | page=16 |vauthors=Samadi L, Schmid A, Eriksson BJ| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Xiphosura&quot; /&gt; At the other extreme, [[jumping spider]]s have a very wide field of vision,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Spiders&quot; /&gt; and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of [[dragonfly|dragonflies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HarlandJackson2000EightLeggedCats&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harland, D.P. |author2=Jackson, R.R. |year=2000 |title=&quot;Eight-legged cats&quot; and how they see - a review of recent research on jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) |journal=Cimbebasia |volume=16 |pages=231–240 |url=http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/ccnr/Papers/Downloads/Harland_Cimb2000.pdf |access-date=2008-10-11 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928164131/http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/ccnr/Papers/Downloads/Harland_Cimb2000.pdf# |archive-date=2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; able to see in both colors and UV-light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/49454132/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/their-eight-eyes-jumping-spiders-are-true-visionaries/ |title=With their eight eyes, jumping spiders are true visionaries|date=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[Image:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|200px|right|thumb| Female [[scorpion]] ''[[Compsobuthus werneri]]'' carrying its young (white)]]
[[Horseshoe crab]]s, which are aquatic, use [[external fertilization]], in other words the [[sperm]] and [[ovum|ova]] meet outside the parents' bodies. Their [[trilobite]]-like [[larva]]e look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only two pairs of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they [[molt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Xiphosura&quot; /&gt;

Being air-breathing animals, the living [[arachnid]]s (excluding horseshoe crabs) use [[internal fertilization]], which is direct in some species, in other words the males' [[genitalia]] make contact with the females'. However, in most species fertilization is indirect. Male spiders use their [[pedipalp]]s as [[syringe]]s to &quot;inject&quot; sperm into the females' reproductive openings,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Spiders&quot; /&gt; but most arachnids produce [[spermatophore]]s (packages of sperm) which the females take into their bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt; [[Courtship]] rituals are common, especially in the most powerful predators, where males risk being eaten before mating. Most arachnids lay eggs, but all scorpions and a few [[mite]]s keep the eggs inside their bodies until they hatch and offspring rather like miniature adults emerge.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004ArachnidaGen&quot; /&gt;

Levels of parental care for the young range from zero to prolonged. Scorpions carry their young on their backs until the first [[molt]], and in a few semi-social species the young remain with their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lourenço, W.R. |contribution=Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis |title=European Arachnology 2000 |editor1=Toft, S. |editor2=Scharff, N. | pages=71–85 |publisher=Aarhus University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-87-7934-001-5 |url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF |access-date=2008-09-28 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some spiders care for their young, for example a [[wolf spider]]'s brood cling to rough bristles on the mother's back,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004Spiders&quot; /&gt; and females of some species respond to the &quot;begging&quot; behavior of their young by giving them their prey, provided it is no longer struggling, or even [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitate]] food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foelix1996SpidersReproduction&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Spiders |author=Foelix, R.F. |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-509594-4 |chapter=Reproduction |pages=[https://archive.org/details/biologyofspiders00foel_0/page/176 176–212] |via=Google Books |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUgyqxNKhyAC&amp;q=%22Biology+of+Spiders%22+Foelix&amp;pg=PP1 |access-date=2008-10-08 |df=dmy-all |url=https://archive.org/details/biologyofspiders00foel_0/page/176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary history==
===Fossil record===
There are large gaps in the chelicerates' [[fossil]] record because, like all [[arthropod]]s, their [[exoskeleton]]s are [[organic matter|organic]] and hence their fossils are rare except in a few [[lagerstätte]]n where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues. The [[Burgess shale]] animals like ''[[Sidneyia]]'' from about {{ma|505}} have been classified as chelicerates, the latter because its appendages resemble those of the [[Xiphosura]] (horseshoe crabs). However, [[cladistic]] analyses that consider wider ranges of characteristics place neither as chelicerates. There is debate about whether ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'' from earlier in the [[Cambrian]] period, about {{ma|525}}, was a chelicerate. Another Cambrian fossil, ''[[Kodymirus]]'', was originally classified as an [[aglaspid]] but may have been a [[eurypterid]] and therefore a chelicerate. If any of these was closely related to chelicerates, there is a gap of at least 43&amp;nbsp;million years in the record between true chelicerates and their nearest not-quite chelicerate relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;&gt;{{citation

The &quot;traditional&quot; view of the arthropod &quot;family tree&quot; shows chelicerates as less closely related to the other major living groups ([[crustacea]]ns; [[hexapoda|hexapods]], which includes [[insect]]s; and [[myriapod]]s, which includes [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s) than these other groups are to each other. Recent research since 2001, using both [[molecular phylogenetic]]s (the application of cladistic analysis to [[biochemistry]], especially to organisms' [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]) and detailed examination of how various arthropods' [[nervous system]]s develop in the [[embryo]]s, suggests that chelicerates are most closely related to myriapods, while hexapods and crustaceans are each other's closest relatives. However, these results are derived from analyzing only living arthropods, and including extinct ones such as [[trilobite]]s causes a swing back to the &quot;traditional&quot; view, placing trilobites as the sister-group of the [[Tracheata]] (hexapods plus myriapods) and chelicerates as least closely related to the other groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenner2006ChallengingReceivedWisdoms&quot;&gt;{{citation

It is generally agreed that the Chelicerata contain the [[Class (biology)|classes]] [[Arachnida]] ([[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[mite]]s, etc.), [[Xiphosura]] ([[horseshoe crab]]s) and [[Eurypterida]] (sea scorpions, extinct).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schultz2007ArachnidPhylogeny&quot;&gt;{{citation

However, the structure of &quot;family tree&quot; relationships within the Chelicerata has been controversial ever since the late 19th century. An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of [[RNA]] features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower-level groups, but its results for the high-level relationships between major sub-groups of chelicerates were unstable, in other words minor changes in the inputs caused significant changes in the outputs of the computer program used (POY).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The position of scorpions is particularly controversial. Some early fossils such as the Late [[Silurian]] ''[[Proscorpius]]'' have been classified by paleontologists as scorpions, but described as wholly aquatic as they had [[gill]]s rather than [[book lung]]s or [[Invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e. Their mouths are also completely under their heads and almost between the first pair of legs, as in the extinct [[eurypterid]]s and living [[horseshoe crab]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weygoldt1998EvolutionAndSystematicsOfChelicerata&quot; /&gt; This presents a difficult choice: classify ''Proscorpius'' and other aquatic fossils as something other than scorpions, despite the similarities; accept that &quot;scorpions&quot; are not monophyletic but consist of separate aquatic and terrestrial groups;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weygoldt1998EvolutionAndSystematicsOfChelicerata&quot; /&gt; or treat scorpions as more closely related to eurypterids and possibly horseshoe crabs than to spiders and other [[arachnid]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;BraddyAldridgeEtAl1999LamellateBookGills&quot; /&gt; so that either scorpions are not arachnids or &quot;arachnids&quot; are not monophyletic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weygoldt1998EvolutionAndSystematicsOfChelicerata&quot;&gt;{{citation

Eurypterids were recovered as closely related to arachnids instead of xiphosurans, forming the group [[Sclerophorata]] within the clade [[Dekatriata]] (composed of sclerophorates and [[Chasmataspidida|chasmataspidids]]). This work suggested it is possible that Dekatriata is synonymous with Sclerophorata as the reproductive system, the primary defining feature of sclerophorates, has not been thoroughly studied in chasmataspidids. Dekatriata is in turn part of the [[Prosomapoda]], a group including the [[Xiphosurida]] (the only monophyletic xiphosuran group) and other stem-genera. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the chelicerates places the Xiphosura within the Arachnida as the sister group of Ricinulei.&lt;ref name=&quot;BallesterosSharma2019&quot; /&gt;, but others still retrieve a monophyletic arachnida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lozano-FernandezTanner2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozano-Fernandez|first1=Jesus|last2=Tanner|first2=Alastair R.|last3=Giacomelli|first3=Mattia|last4=Carton|first4=Robert|last5=Vinther|first5=Jakob|last6=Edgecombe|first6=Gregory D.|last7=Pisani|first7=Davide|title=Increasing species sampling in chelicerate genomic-scale datasets provides support for monophyly of Acari and Arachnida|journal=Nature Communications|volume=10|issue=1|year=2019|page=2295|issn=2041-1723|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-10244-7|pmid=31127117|pmc=6534568|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s ate the flesh of [[horseshoe crabs]], and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for [[livestock]] were abandoned when it was found that this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, ''[[limulus amebocyte lysate]]'', which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous [[bacteria]], and to detect [[spinal meningitis]] and some [[cancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{About|an outpost in space|radio broadcasts sent from space|space radio station|stations named &quot;Space&quot;|Space (disambiguation)}}
[[File:STS-135 final flyaround of ISS 1.jpg|thumb|380px|right|The [[International Space Station]], the largest object ever assembled in a [[geocentric orbit]]]]
A '''space station''', also known as an '''orbital station''' or an '''orbital space station''', is a [[spacecraft]] capable of [[human spaceflight|supporting a human crew]] in [[orbit]] for an extended period of time. It lacks major [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] or [[landing]] systems. Stations must have docking ports to allow other spacecraft to dock to transfer crew and supplies.

The purpose of maintaining an orbital outpost varies depending on the program. Space stations have most often been launched for scientific purposes, but military launches have also occurred. As of {{year}}, one fully operational and permanently inhabited space station is in [[low Earth orbit]]: the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which is used to study the [[effects of spaceflight on the human body]] as well as to provide a location to conduct a greater number and longer length of scientific studies than is possible on other space vehicles. [[China]], [[India]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States|U.S.]], as well as [[Bigelow Aerospace]] and [[Axiom Space]], are all planning other stations for the coming decades.

The hardware developed during the initial Soviet efforts remains in use, with evolved variants comprising a considerable part of the ISS, orbiting today. Each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. Starting with the ill-fated flight of the [[Soyuz 11]] crew to [[Salyut 1]], all recent human spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations. The [[List of spaceflight records#Most time in space|duration record for a single spaceflight]] is 437.75 days, set by [[Valeri Polyakov]] aboard ''Mir'' from 1994 to 1995. {{As of|2016}}, four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard ''Mir''. The last military-use space station was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Salyut 5]], which was launched under the [[Almaz]] program and orbited between 1976 and 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[[S:NASA FACTS/Russian Space Stations|Russian Space Stations (wikisource)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early stations were monolithic designs that were constructed and launched in one piece, generally containing all their supplies and experimental equipment. A crew would then be launched to join the station and perform research. After the supplies had been used up, the station was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salyut&quot;/&gt;

The first space station was [[Salyut 1]], which was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] on April 19, 1971. The earlier Soviet stations were all designated &quot;Salyut&quot;, but among these there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, [[Salyut 2]], [[Salyut 3]], and [[Salyut 5]], were also known as [[Almaz]] stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Outposts&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Outposts on the Frontier: A Fifty-Year History of Space Stations|first=Jay|last=Chladek|year=2017|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-2292-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V60oDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilian stations [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]] were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the [[Soyuz 7K-T|Soyuz ferry]] could spend 90 days in space, at which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft.&lt;ref name=MHH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|title=Mir Hardware Heritage|author=D.S.F. Portree|publisher=NASA|year=1995|accessdate=30 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907191412/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|archivedate=7 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. The American [[Skylab]] (1973-1979) was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never utilized. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which &quot;hard docked&quot; with a [[TKS spacecraft|TKS tug]] shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Outposts&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Mir'' (1986–2001) ===

Unlike previous stations, the Soviet space station ''[[Mir]]'' had a [[modular design]]; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added to that.  This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful [[launch vehicle]]. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support craft, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Mir 1986–2000|year=2000|publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]|isbn=978-0-9506597-4-9|editor=Hall, R.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmir19860000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modules are still being developed based on the design and capabilities of ''Mir''.

Marta's parents died of [[Great Plague of Vienna|the plague around 1689]], leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day [[Alūksne]] in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by [[Johann Ernst Glück]], a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=National treasure: The first Bible in Latvian|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/culture/national-treasure-the-first-bible-in-latvian.a197713/|access-date=2020-09-15|website=eng.lsm.lv|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=131}}  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.

Marta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Glück became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[dragoon]], Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Glück offered to work as a translator, and [[Field Marshal]] [[Boris Sheremetev]] agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.

There are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General [[Rudolph Felix Bauer]], later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=131}}

Afterwards she became part of the household of [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Prince Alexander Menshikov]], who was the best friend of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great of Russia]]. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.

It is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=135}}  In 1705,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} she converted to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and took the new name of Catherine Alexeyevna (''Yekaterina Alexeyevna'').{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=131}} She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.

==Marriage and family life==
Though no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=136}} They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, [[Anna Petrovna|Anna]] (born 1708) and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Yelizaveta]] (born 1709).

Peter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a [[Cabin of Peter the Great|three-room log cabin]] with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=136}} As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and often was called in to do so.
Catherine went with Peter on his [[Pruth Campaign]] in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book ''Peter the Great''. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier [[Baltacı Mehmet Pasha]] into allowing a retreat.

Mehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced [[Eudoxia Lopukhina]], who had borne him the [[Tsarevich]] [[Alexis Petrovich]]. Upon their wedding, Catherine took the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The [[Order of Saint Catherine]] was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.

===Descendants===
Catherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]:

===Siblings===
Upon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.

* Krystyna Skowrońska, renamed{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Christina ({{lang-ru | Христина}}) Samuilovna [[Skavronsky|Skavronskaya]] (1687–14 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich ({{lang-ru |Симон Гейнрих}}) (1672–1728) and their descendants became the '''Counts {{Interlanguage link multi| Gendrikov | ru |3= Гендриковы}}'''.
* Anna Skowrońska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the '''Counts Efimovsky'''.
* Karol Skowroński, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=135}} and made a [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a [[Russia]]n woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line in 1793.
* Fryderyk Skowroński, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727{{sfn|Hughes|2004|p=135}} and was married twice: to N, a [[Lithuania]]n woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.euweb.cz/russia/skavron.html Skavronsky&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Succession to the throne as Empress regnant ==
[[Image:Empress Catherine I -c.1724 -3.jpg|205px|right|thumb|Catherine I as Empress of Russia]]
In 1724 Catherine was officially crowned and named co-ruler and as Empress regnant.

The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of [[Willem Mons]], brother of Peter's former mistress [[Anna Mons|Anna]], and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting to Catherine, [[Matryona Balk]]. He served as secretary to Catherine. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence on who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matrena had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matrena exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.

Peter died (28 January 1725 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the &quot;new men&quot;, commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the [[Russian Guards|guards regiments]] with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia, giving her the title of Empress. Supporting evidence was &quot;produced&quot; from Peter's secretary Makarov and the [[Feofan Prokopovich|Bishop of Pskov]], both &quot;new men&quot; with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, [[Peter Tolstoy]] and with other members of the [[Supreme Privy Council]].

==Death==
She died two years after Peter, at age 43, in [[St. Petersburg]], where she was buried at [[St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress]]. [[Tuberculosis]], diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.

==Assessment and legacy==
[[File:Equestrian portrait of Catherine I.jpg|205px|right|thumb|Catherine riding a horse]]
Catherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law [[Catherine the Great]], all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks,{{sfn|Lincoln|1981|p=164}} was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.{{sfn|Lincoln|1981|p=168}}  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.{{sfn|Lincoln|1981|p=168}}  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.{{sfn|Lincoln|1981|p=168-169}}  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The [[Supreme Privy Council]] concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Duke of Holstein]], against Great Britain.

Catherine gave her name to [[Catherinehof]] near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the [[Tsarskoye Selo]] estate, where the [[Catherine Palace]] still bears her name.

She also gave her name to the [[Kadriorg Palace]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Katharinental'', meaning &quot;Catherine's Valley&quot;), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later [[Kadriorg]] neighbourhood of [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.

In general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of [[tsar]]s to be a state secret.

'''Catherine II'''{{efn|{{lang-ru|Екатери́на Алексе́евна|translit=Yekaterina Alekseyevna}}}} (born '''Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst'''; 2 May 1729 in [[Szczecin]]{{spnd}}17 November 1796{{efn|Old Style Date: 21 April 1729{{spnd}}6 November 1796}}), most commonly known as '''Catherine the Great''',{{efn|{{lang-ru|Екатери́на Вели́кая|translit=Yekaterina Velikaya}}}} was [[Empress of Russia]] from 1762 until 1796—the country's longest-ruling female leader. She came to power following a coup d'état that overthrew her husband and second cousin, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. Under her reign, Russia grew larger, its culture was revitalised, and it was recognized as one of the [[great power]]s worldwide.

In her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often relied on her noble favourites, most notably Count [[Grigory Orlov]] and [[Grigory Potemkin]]. Assisted by highly successful [[field Marshals of Russia|generals]] such as [[Alexander Suvorov]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]], and [[list of Russian Admirals|admirals]] such as [[Samuel Greig]] and [[Fyodor Ushakov]], she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the [[Crimean Khanate]] was crushed following victories over the [[Bar confederation]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]] due to the support of the United Kingdom, and Russia colonised the territories of [[Novorossiya]] along the coasts of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Azov Sea]]s. In the west, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], ruled by Catherine's former lover, King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], was eventually [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]], with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia [[Russian colonisation of the Americas|started to colonise]] Alaska, establishing [[Russian America]].

Catherine reformed the administration of Russian [[guberniya]]s (governorates), and many [[list of cities in Russia|new cities and towns]] were founded on her orders. An admirer of [[Peter the Great]], Catherine continued to modernize Russia along Western European lines. However, military conscription and the economy continued to depend on [[serfdom in Russia|serfdom]], and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labour. This was one of the chief reasons behind rebellions, including the large-scale [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev Rebellion]] of [[Cossacks]], nomads, peoples of Volga and peasants.

The period of Catherine the Great's rule, the '''Catherinian Era''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272431572 |title=Religion and Enlightenment in Catherinian Russia: The Teachings of Metropolitan Platon by Elise Kimerling Wirtschafter |last=Skinner |first=Barbara |website=[[ResearchGate]] |date=January 2015 |accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the Golden Age of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.tzar.ru/museums/history/monarchy |title=Russian Monarchy |website=tzar.ru|publisher=The Tsarskoye Selo State Museum-Preserve |accessdate=8 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009093957/http://eng.tzar.ru/museums/history/monarchy |archive-date=9 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manifesto on Freedom of the Nobility'', issued during the short reign of Peter III and confirmed by Catherine, freed Russian nobles from compulsory military or state service. Construction of many mansions of the nobility, in the [[classicism|classical]] style endorsed by the empress, changed the face of the country. She enthusiastically supported the ideals of [[the Enlightenment]] and is often included in the ranks of the [[enlightened despot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Despot&quot; is not derogatory in this context.

== Early life ==
[[File:Farna Street in Szczecin, 2018 (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Farna Street in Szczecin. Building, where Catharine lived in her early years]]
Catherine was born in Stettin, [[Pomerania]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now [[Szczecin]], Poland) as Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. Her father, [[Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]], belonged to the [[House of Ascania|ruling German family]] of [[Principality of Anhalt|Anhalt]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Siebigk: ''[[s:de:ADB:Christian August (Fürst von Anhalt-Zerbst)|Christian August (Fürst von Anhalt-Zerbst)]]''. In: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB). Band 4, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1876, S. 157–59.&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to become the duke of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] but in vain and by the birth of her daughter held the rank of a [[Prussia]]n general in his capacity as governor of the city of Stettin. But because of conversion of her second cousin Peter III to Orthodox Christianity, two of her first cousins became [[King of Sweden|Kings of Sweden]]: [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cronholm, Neander N. |title=A History of Sweden from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924071200822|year=1902|publisher=Chicago, New York [etc.] The author}} ch 37&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the custom then prevailing in the ruling dynasties of Germany, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors. According to her memoirs, Sophie was regarded as a tomboy, and trained herself to master a sword. Just prior to her arrival in Russia, she participated in a duel with her female second cousin from Anhalt. During this duel between noble girls, both exchanged sword-to-sword blows only, as they both had a fear of it leading to bloodletting. Sophie came to be known by the nickname Fike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/russia/History/sub9_1b/entry-4938.html|title=Catherine the Great|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2020}} 

Sophie's childhood was very uneventful apart from the duel. She once wrote to her correspondent [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Baron Grimm]]: &quot;I see nothing of interest in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sergeant, Philip W. |title=The Courtships of Catherine the Great|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|date=2004|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sophie was born a princess, her family had very little money. Her rise to power was supported by her [[Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp|mother's]] wealthy relatives, who were both nobles and royal relations. Her mother's brother became the heir to the Swedish throne after her second cousin Peter III converted to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Streeter, Michael| title=Catherine the Great| publisher=Haus Publishing|date= 2007|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|2011|pp=10–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more than 300 sovereign entities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], many of them quite small and powerless, made for a highly competitive political system as the various princely families fought for advantage over each other, often via political marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the smaller German princely families, an advantageous marriage was one of the best means of advancing their interests, and the young Sophie was groomed throughout her childhood to be the wife of some powerful ruler in order to improve the position of the reigning house of Anhalt. Besides her native German, Sophie became fluent in French, the [[lingua franca]] of European elites in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Sophie received the standard education for an 18th-century German princess, with a concentration upon learning the etiquette expected of a lady, French, and Lutheran theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;b40&quot;&gt;(12)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand Duchess Catherine Alexeevna by L.Caravaque (1745, Gatchina museum).jpg|thumb|upright|Young Catherine soon after her arrival in Russia, by [[Louis Caravaque]]]]

Sophie first met her future husband, who would become [[Peter III of Russia]], at the age of 10. Peter was her second cousin. Based on her writings, she found Peter detestable upon meeting him. She disliked his pale complexion and his fondness for alcohol at such a young age. Peter also still played with toy soldiers. She later wrote that she stayed at one end of the castle, and Peter at the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Streeter, Michael |title=Catherine the Great|publisher=Haus Publishing|date= 2007| page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage, reign of Peter III, and coup d'état ==

The choice of Princess Sophie as wife of the future tsar was one result of the [[Lopukhina Conspiracy]] in which [[Count Lestocq]] and Prussian king [[Frederick the Great]] took an active part. The object was to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia, to weaken the influence of [[Austria]] and to ruin the chancellor [[Aleksey Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin]], on whom Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] relied, and who was a known partisan of the Austrian alliance. The diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, [[Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp]]. Historical accounts portray Johanna as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Her hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for King Frederick II of Prussia. Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: She had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother [[Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin#Marriage and issue|Charles Augustus]] (Karl August von Holstein), but he died of smallpox in 1727 before the wedding could take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Huberty| first = Michel| title = L'Allemagne dynastique: Les quinze Familles qui on fait l'Empire| year = 1994| isbn=978-2-901138-07-5| page = 166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to Sophie, and her marriage to Peter eventually took place in [[1745]].

When Sophie arrived in Russia in 1744, she spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people as well. She applied herself to learning the Russian language with zeal, rising at night and walking about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons. This practice led to a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. When she wrote her memoirs, she said she made the decision then to do whatever was necessary and to profess to believe whatever was required of her to become qualified to wear the crown. Although she mastered the language, she retained an accent.

Sophie recalled in her memoirs that as soon as she arrived in Russia, she fell ill with a [[pleuritis]] that almost killed her.{{inconsistent|date=October 2020}}&lt;!--Is the pleuritis the same malady as the pneumonia referred to in the prior paragraph?--&gt; She credited her survival to frequent [[bloodletting]]; in a single day, she had four [[Phlebotomy|phlebotomies]]. Her mother, who was opposed to this practice, fell into the empress's disfavour. When Sophie's situation looked desperate, her mother wanted her confessed by a Lutheran pastor. Awaking from her delirium, however, Sophie said: &quot;I don't want any Lutheran; I want my Orthodox father [clergyman].&quot; This raised her in the empress's esteem.

Princess Sophie's father, a devout German Lutheran, opposed his daughter's conversion to [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Despite his objection, however, on 28 June 1744, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] received Princess Sophie as a member with the new name Catherine (Yekaterina or Ekaterina) and the (artificial) [[patronymic]] Алексеевна (Alekseyevna, daughter of Aleksey) i. e. with the same name as Catherine I, the mother of Elizabeth and the grandmother of Peter III. On the following day, the formal betrothal took place. The long-planned dynastic marriage finally occurred on 21 August 1745 in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Sophie had turned 16; her father did not travel to Russia for the wedding. The bridegroom, known as Peter von Holstein-Gottorp, had become Duke of [[Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp|Holstein-Gottorp]] (located in the north-west of {{As of|2008 |alt=present-day}} Germany near the border with Denmark) in 1739. The newlyweds settled in the palace of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], which remained the residence of the &quot;young court&quot; for many years to come. The pair governed the duchy (less than third of the current German land Schleswig-Holstein even if its part of Schleswig, occupied by Denmark, is accounted for) to obtain experience to govern Russia. 

Apart from governing experience the marriage was unsuccessful - it was not consummated for twelve years due to Peter III's impotence and mental immaturity. After Peter took a mistress, Catherine became involved with other prominent court figures. She soon became popular with several powerful political groups which opposed her husband.
Bored with her husband, Catherine became an avid reader of books, mostly in French.&lt;ref&gt;Frank T. Brechka, &quot;Catherine the Great: The Books She Read.&quot; ''Journal of Library History'' 4.1 (1969): 39-52 [Brechka,  online]. &lt;/ref&gt; Catherine disparaged her husband as devoted to reading &quot;Lutheran prayer-books, the other the history of and trial of some highway robbers who had been hanged or broken on the wheel&quot;.&lt;ref name=b40/&gt; It was during this period that she first read [[Voltaire]] and the other ''philosophes'' of the [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]]. As she learned Russian, she became increasingly interested in the literature of her adopted country.  Finally, it was the ''Annals'' by [[Tacitus]] that caused what she called a &quot;revolution&quot; in her teenage mind as Tacitus was the first intellectual she read who understood power politics as they are, not as they should be. She was especially impressed with Tacitus's argument that people do not act for their professed idealistic reasons, and instead she learned to look for the &quot;hidden and interested motives&quot;.&lt;ref name=b41&gt;{{harvnb|Brechka|1969|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Alexander Hertzen, who edited the version of Catherine's memoirs, while living at Oranienbaum, Catherine had her first sexual relationship with [[Sergei Saltykov]] as her marriage to Peter had not been consummated as Catherine later claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Farquhar | first = Michael | year = 2001 | title = A Treasure of Royal Scandals | page = [https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/88 88] | publisher = Penguin Books | place = New York | isbn = 978-0-7394-2025-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/88 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
But Catherine left to Paul I the final version of her memoirs explaining why Paul had been the son of Peter III. [[Serge Saltykov|Sergei Saltykov]] was used to make Peter jealous and relations with Saltykov were platonic ones. Catherine wanted to become an empress herself and did not want another heir to the throne therefore. But empress Elizabeth blackmailed Peter and Catherine that they both had been involved into a plot of Russian military in 1749 to execute the will of Catherine I and to crown Peter together with Catherine. Elizabeth requested for her new legal heir from Catherine. Only when a new legal heir, the son of Catherine and Peter, had appeared to be strong and to survive Elizabeth allowed Catherine to have real sexual lovers just because Elizabeth probably wanted to leave both Catherine and her accomplice Peter III without any rights for a Russian throne in a revenge for the participation of the pair in military plots to crown Peter and Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/article/pavel_birth.htm M. Safonov. The origin of Paul I//The history of Gatchina]&lt;/ref&gt;
After this over the years Catherine carried on sexual liaisons with many men, including  [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], [[Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov]] (1734–1783), [[Alexander Vasilchikov]], [[Grigory Potemkin]],   and others.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Catherine the Great'', pp 400–403.&lt;/ref&gt;  She became friends with Princess [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Ekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]], the sister of her husband's official mistress, who in Dashkov's opinion introduced her to several powerful political groups that opposed her husband, though Catherine had been involved in military schemes against Elizabeth probably to get rid of Peter III at the next stage at least since 1749. 

Peter III's temperament became quite unbearable for those who resided in the palace. He would announce trying drills in the morning to male servants, who later joined Catherine in her room to sing and dance until late hours.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Catherine the Great'', pp 51–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspension system keeps the coil centered in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical suspension system consists of two parts: the ''spider'', which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the lower frame and provides the majority of the restoring force, and the ''surround'', which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the magnetic gap. The spider is usually made of a [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of [[Bakelite]] material, joined by six or eight curved &quot;legs.&quot; Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.

=== Cone materials ===
The cone surround can be [[rubber]] or polyester [[foam]], treated paper or a ring of corrugated, resin coated fabric; it is attached to both the outer cone circumference and to the upper frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation has advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaks air to some degree, but is degraded by time, exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, limiting useful life before failure. Treated paper surrounds will eventually fail.

The wire in a voice coil is usually made of [[copper]], though [[aluminum]]—and, rarely, [[silver]]—may be used.  The advantage of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper.  This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.  A disadvantage of aluminum is that it is not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed.  These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration.  Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside ring of the gap is one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) is the other. The pole piece and backplate are often made as a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.

Modern driver magnets are almost always permanent and made of [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], [[alnico]], or, more recently, [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth]] such as [[neodymium]] and [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]]. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s;  there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — is the use of the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce [[field coil loudspeaker|electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils]], as was common in the earliest designs;  one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980,{{cn|date=September 2020}} despite the embarrassing problem of alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by &quot;recharging&quot; the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

After 1980, most (but not quite all) driver manufacturers switched from alnico to ferrite magnets, which are made from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite. Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.

The size and type of magnet and details of the magnetic circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, the shape of the pole piece affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A &quot;shorting ring&quot;, or [[Faraday loop]], may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.

Driver design—including the particular way two or more drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of [[timbre]] and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Don |author2=Carolyn Davis |title=Sound System Engineering |publisher=Focal Press |year=1997 |edition=2 |page=350 |chapter=Loudspeakers and Loudspeaker Arrays |isbn=978-0-240-80305-0 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouyzH6vsIIwC&amp;pg=PA350 |access-date=March 30, 2010 |quote=We often give lip service to the fact that audio allows its practitioners to engage in both art and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fremer |first=Michael |date=April 2004 |title=Aerial Model 20T loudspeaker |journal=Stereophile |url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/404aerial/# |access-date=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/arts/home-entertainment-speaker-design-goes-modern.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Speaker Design Goes Modern |last=Fantel |first=Hans |date=June 6, 1993 |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an [[anechoic chamber]] to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.

Fabrication of finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and weight limitations. High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 or more per pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nolaspeakers.com/reviews/tas/EditorsChoice2007.html The Absolute Sound, issue 175, October 2007. hp's Workshop: HP's Editor's Choice Awards. Speaker Systems: ''The Nola Grand Reference Mk IV.1'', $145,000 (standard finish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Economical mass market speaker systems and drivers available for much lower costs may be manufactured in China or other low-cost manufacturing locations.

===Driver types===
[[File:Lautsprecher 4-wege 2.jpg|thumb|A four-way, high fidelity '''loudspeaker system'''. Each of the four drivers outputs a different frequency range; the fifth aperture at the bottom is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]

Individual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.

====Full-range drivers====
{{Main article|Full-range speaker}}
A full-range driver is a speaker designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically {{convert|3|to|8|in|cm}} in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some [[computer speaker]]s, etc. In [[hi-fi]] speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low-cost quarter-wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|website=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|access-date=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710195941/https://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|archive-date=10 July 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/celebrity/october-kickstarter-projects_1.html|title=Top 10 Entertainment|website=AskMen|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a ''whizzer'': a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.

Limited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and [[clock radio]]s. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.

====Subwoofer==== 
{{Main article|Subwoofer}}
A subwoofer is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200&amp;nbsp;Hz for consumer systems,&lt;ref name=&quot;crutchfield.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5VsEXVgtser/Learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_glossary.html Home Speakers Glossary].

Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by [[diffraction]], the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor.  This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies;  such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.

To accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances (typically from cabinet panels), subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds of cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated [[power amplifier]]s and electronic [[Infrasound|subsonic]] (sub)-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g., a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;powered&quot; subwoofers, with the former including a power amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Terms |work=Home Theater Design |publisher=ETS-eTech |page=1 |access-date=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723231911/http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |archive-date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, &quot;passive&quot; subwoofers require external amplification.

In typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets.  Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound.  Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point).  However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called [[standing waves]]) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue [[sound reinforcement system]]s. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a [[bass reflex]] port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.

====Woofer====
{{Main article|Woofer}}
A [[woofer]] is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see [[speaker enclosure]] for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use.  Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.

====Mid-range driver====
{{Main article|Mid-range speaker}}
A [[mid-range speaker]] is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1–6&amp;nbsp;kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be [[compression driver]]s (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.

====Tweeter====
[[File:Tw15ul9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of a dome tweeter]]
{{Main article|Tweeter}}
A [[tweeter]] is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system.  A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams.  Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwendijk, Joris A. (1988) [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=5129 &quot;Compact Ribbon Tweeter/Midrange Loudspeaker.&quot;] Audio Engineering Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coaxial drivers====
A coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or several combined concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as [[Altec Lansing|Altec]], [[Tannoy]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[KEF]], SEAS, B&amp;C Speakers, BMS, [[Cabasse (company)|Cabasse]] and [[Genelec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Genelec 8260A Technical Paper |url=http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |date=September 2009 |publisher=Genelec |pages=3–4 |access-date=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230170304/http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=30 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossover===
{{Main article|Audio crossover}}
[[File:Passive Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A passive crossover]]
[[File:Active Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A bi-amplified system with an active crossover]]Used in [[multi-driver speaker systems]], the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. &quot;bands&quot;), according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation (&quot;ripple&quot;) within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.

Crossovers can be ''passive'' or ''active''. A [[Audio crossover#Passive crossovers|passive crossover]] is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more [[resistor]]s, inductors, or non-polar [[capacitor]]s. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in [[damping factor]] before the voice coil &lt;ref name=ActivePassive&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/biamp-vs-passive.htm ''Active Vs. Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands ''before'' power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt; Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Acoustic Society. ''The B.A.S. Speaker'', September 1978. Peter W. Mitchell: &quot;The D-23 crossover can be used for bi-amping, tri-amping, or even quad-amping.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a passive crossover between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover between the low-frequency driver and the combined mid- and high frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;EAW [http://www.eaw.com/products/KF/kf300.html ''KF300/600 Series&amp;nbsp;— Compact three-way VAT Systems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424065507/http://www.eaw.com/products/kf/kf300.html |date=2012-04-24 }}. Three-way loudspeakers switchable between bi-amped and other modes. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yorkville [http://www.yorkville.com/products.asp?cat=38&amp;id=268&amp;type=29 ''U215 Speaker&amp;nbsp;– 1600w 2x15 / 3x5 inch / 1 inch''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322012059/http://www.yorkville.com/products.asp?cat=38&amp;id=268&amp;type=29 |date=2012-03-22 }}. Three-way loudspeaker switchable between bi-amped and fully passive modes. &lt;/ref&gt;

Passive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes and are by far the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24&amp;nbsp;dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances,&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/lr-passive.htm ''Design of Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world.&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign/&gt; When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, [[dynamic range compression]] and limiting control.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt;

===Enclosures===
{{Main article|Loudspeaker enclosure}}
[[File:4-Wege Lautsprecher.jpg|thumb|right|An unusual three-way speaker system. The cabinet is narrow to raise the frequency where a diffraction effect called the &quot;baffle step&quot; occurs.]]
Most loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]], or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front.  The sound waves emitted from the back are 180° [[out of phase]] with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they  typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.

The simplest driver mount is a flat panel (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/qa0604-6.htm Q. Sound On Sound, June 2004. ''What's the difference between ported and un-ported monitors?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 Record Producer. ''Infinite baffle''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102014320/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, [[visco-elastic]] materials (e.g., mineral-loaded [[bitumen]]) or thin [[lead]] sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.

However, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm—again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called &quot;damping&quot;), such as [[glass wool]], wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.

Other enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including ''[[bass reflex]]'', ''passive radiator'', ''transmission line'', etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.

To make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.

The speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause [[diffraction]], resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, or some combination of these and other schemes.

====Horn loudspeakers====
[[File:3-way horn speaker.png|thumb|A three-way loudspeaker that uses horns in front of each of the three drivers: a shallow horn for the tweeter, a long, straight horn for mid frequencies and a folded horn for the woofer]]
{{Main article|Horn loudspeaker}}
[[Horn loudspeaker]]s are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of [[Horn (acoustic)|horns]] as voice-amplifying [[megaphone]]s dates at least to the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Trumpet, Speaking and Hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and horns were used in mechanical [[Phonograph|gramophones]] as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.

The size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.

A horn loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110&amp;nbsp;dB at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90&amp;nbsp;dB sensitivity, and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.

==== Transmission line loudspeaker ====
{{Main article|Transmission line loudspeaker}}
A [[transmission line loudspeaker]] is a loudspeaker enclosure design which uses an [[acoustic transmission line]] within the cabinet, compared to the simpler enclosures used by sealed (closed) or [[Bass reflex|ported (bass reflex)]] designs. Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound from the back of the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows far greater control and use of speaker energy and the resulting sound.

===Wiring connections===
[[File:Banana plugs speaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Binding post|Two-way binding posts]] on a loudspeaker, connected using [[Banana connector|banana plugs]].]]
[[File:bi-amp capable.jpg|thumb|right|A 4-ohm loudspeaker with two pairs of binding posts capable of accepting bi-wiring after the removal of two metal straps.]]

Most home [[hi-fi]] loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have [[binding post]]s, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper [[electrical polarity]] (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −;  speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be &quot;out of phase&quot; or more properly &quot;out of polarity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA186|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|first1=Gary|last1=Davis|first2=Gary D.|last2=Davis|date=14 April 1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780881889000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&amp;pg=PA298|title=The Audio Dictionary: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|first1=Glenn D.|last1=White|first2=Gary J.|last2=Louie|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780295801704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Audio in Media|first=Stanley R.|last=Alten|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781285675299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1t0GxyvVbMC&amp;pg=PA130|title=Guide to Sound Systems for Worship|first=Jon F.|last=Eiche|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|access-date=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780793500291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[sound reinforcement system]], [[PA system]] and [[instrument amplifier]] speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4&quot; speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use [[Speakon]] connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.

===Wireless speakers===

[[File:HP Roar Wireless Speaker.jpg|thumbnail|right|HP Roar Wireless Speaker]]
[[Wireless speakers]] are very similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an [[active loudspeaker]]. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.

Wireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or possibly batteries. Only the wire to the amplifier is eliminated.

==Specifications==
[[File:Eltax Silverstone 200 loudspeaker label.jpg|thumb|Specifications label on a loudspeaker]]
Speaker specifications generally include:
* '''Speaker or driver type''' (individual units only)&amp;nbsp;– [[Full-range]], woofer, tweeter, or [[Mid-range speaker|mid-range]].
* '''Size''' of individual drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside diameter of the basket.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-278-B &quot;Mounting Dimensions for Loudspeakers&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may less commonly also be the diameter of the cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one mounting hole to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If the loudspeaker has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.
* '''Rated Power'''&amp;nbsp;– Nominal (or even continuous) [[Electrical power|power]], and peak (or maximum short-term) power a loudspeaker can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; it is never the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies.&lt;ref name=SpeakerDamage&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/bi-amp-p1.htm ''Speaker Damage''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage.&lt;ref name=WhyTweetersBlow&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/tweeters.htm ''Why Do Tweeters Blow When Amplifiers Distort?''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.
* '''[[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]'''&amp;nbsp;– typically 4&amp;nbsp;Ω (ohms), 8&amp;nbsp;Ω, etc.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-299 &quot;Loudspeakers, Dynamic; Magnetic Structures and Impedance&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Baffle or enclosure type''' (enclosed systems only)&amp;nbsp;– Sealed, bass reflex, etc.
* '''Number of drivers''' (complete speaker systems only)&amp;nbsp;– two-way, three-way, etc.
* '''Class''' of loudspeaker:&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Bob. ''Sound Systems: Design and Optimization: Modern Techniques and Tools for Sound System Design and Alignment''. CRC Press, 2016. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
**Class 1: maximum SPL 110-119 dB, the type of loudspeaker used for reproducing a person speaking in a small space or for [[background music]]; mainly used as fill speakers for Class 2 or Class 3 speakers; typically small 4&quot; or 5&quot; woofers and dome tweeters
**Class 2: maximum SPL 120-129 dB, the type of medium power-capable loudspeaker used for reinforcement in small to medium spaces or as fill speakers for Class 3 or Class 4 speakers; typically 5&quot; to 8&quot; woofers and dome tweeters
**Class 3: maximum SPL 130-139 dB, high power-capable loudspeakers used in main systems in small to medium spaces; also used as fill speakers for class 4 speakers; typically 6.5&quot; to 12&quot; woofers and 2&quot; or 3&quot; compression drivers for high frequencies
**Class 4: maximum SPL 140 dB and higher, very high power-capable loudspeakers used as mains in medium to large spaces (or for fill speakers for these medium to large spaces); 10&quot; to 15&quot; woofers and 3&quot; compression drivers

and optionally:
* '''Crossover frequency(ies)''' (multi-driver systems only)&amp;nbsp;– The nominal frequency boundaries of the division between drivers.
* '''[[Frequency response]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The measured, or specified, output over a specified range of frequencies for a constant input level varied across those frequencies. It sometimes includes a variance limit, such as within &quot;± 2.5&amp;nbsp;dB.&quot;
* '''[[Thiele/Small|Thiele/Small parameters]]''' (individual drivers only)&amp;nbsp;– these include the driver's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (resonance frequency), ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;ts&lt;/sub&gt; (a driver's ''Q''; more or less, its [[damping factor]] at resonant frequency), ''V''&lt;sub&gt;as&lt;/sub&gt; (the equivalent air compliance volume of the driver), etc.
* '''Sensitivity'''&amp;nbsp;– The sound pressure level produced by a loudspeaker in a non-reverberant environment, often specified in dB and measured at 1 meter with an input of 1 watt (2.83 rms volts into 8&amp;nbsp;Ω), typically at one or more specified frequencies. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material.
* '''Maximum sound pressure level'''&amp;nbsp;– The highest output the loudspeaker can manage, short of damage or not exceeding a particular distortion level. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material—commonly without reference to frequency range or distortion level.

===Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers===
{{Main article|Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers}}

The load that a driver presents to an amplifier consists of a complex [[electrical impedance]]—a combination of resistance and both [[Capacitance|capacitive]] and [[Inductance|inductive]] [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), and the effects of air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal [[resistive]] load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.

To make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]) that passes through a &quot;speaker coil&quot;  which then (through [[Electrical inductance|inductance]]) creates a magnetic field around the coil, creating a [[magnetic field]]. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.

===Electromechanical measurements===
Examples of typical [[Loudspeaker measurement|measurements]] are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] vs. [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]] (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/testing-devices/speaker.aspx|title=Equipment used for speaker, driver &amp; cabinet testing|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in [[decibel]]s ([[DBSPL|dB&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

===Efficiency vs. sensitivity===
Loudspeaker efficiency is defined as the [[sound power]] output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper [[impedance matching]] between the [[acoustic impedance]] of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.

Driver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called sensitivity ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency. [[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] is usually defined as so many decibels at 1&amp;nbsp;W electrical input, measured at 1 meter (except for [[headphones]]), often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;, which is 1&amp;nbsp;watt into an 8&amp;nbsp;Ω (nominal) speaker impedance (approximately true for many speaker systems). Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as dB with 2.83&amp;nbsp;V @ 1&amp;nbsp;m.

The sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an [[infinite baffle]]. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus &quot;focusing&quot; them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.

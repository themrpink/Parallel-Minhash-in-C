==Background==
The [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] between [[England]] and [[Scotland]] began in 1296 and initially the English were successful under the command of [[Edward I]], having won victories at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)]] and at the [[Capture of Berwick (1296)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;Black, Jeremy. (2005). ''The Seventy Great Battles of All Time''. pp. 71–73. Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-500-25125-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of [[John Balliol]] from the Scottish throne also contributed to the English success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; The Scots had been victorious in defeating the English at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] in 1297. This was countered, however, by Edward I's victory at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; By 1304, Scotland had been conquered, but in 1306 [[Robert the Bruce]] seized the Scottish throne and the war was reopened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

After the death of Edward I, his son [[Edward II of England]] came to the throne in 1307 but was incapable of providing the determined leadership his father had shown, and the English position soon became more difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

In 1313, Bruce demanded the allegiance of all remaining Balliol supporters, under threat of losing their lands, as well as the surrender of the English garrison at [[Stirling Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; The castle was one of the most important castles held by the English, as it commanded the route north into the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; It was besieged in 1314 by Robert the Bruce's younger brother, [[Edward Bruce]], and an agreement was made that if the castle was not relieved by mid-summer it would be surrendered to the Scots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

The English could not ignore this challenge and prepared and equipped a substantial campaign. It is known that Edward II requested 2,000 heavily armoured cavalry and 25,000 infantry, many of whom were likely armed with [[longbow]]s, from England, Wales and Ireland; it is estimated no more than half the infantry actually arrived, but the English army was still by far the largest ever to invade Scotland. The Scottish army probably numbered around 6,000 men,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; including no more than 500 mounted forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Unlike the English, the Scottish cavalry was probably unequipped for charging enemy lines and suitable only for skirmishing and reconnaissance. The Scottish infantry was likely armed with axes, swords and pikes, and included only a few bowmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

The precise numerical advantage of the English forces relative to the Scottish forces is unknown, but modern researchers estimate that the Scottish faced English forces one-and-a-half to two or three times their size.&lt;ref name=&quot;watson&quot;&gt;Watson, F., [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00y2srx/In_Our_Time_The_Battle_of_Bannockburn/ &quot;In Our Time: The Battle of Bannockburn&quot;], BBC Radio, 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward II and his advisors were aware of the places the Scots were likely to challenge them and sent orders for their troops to prepare for an enemy established in boggy ground near the [[River Forth]], near [[Stirling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; The English appear to have advanced in four divisions, known as '[[Sheltron|schiltrons]]', which were strong defensive squares of men with pikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrow |first1=Geoffrey W. S. |title=Robert Bruce and the Community of Realm of Scotland |date=1988 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=225-229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray]], commanded the Scottish [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]], which was stationed about a mile south of Stirling, near the church of St. Ninian, while the king commanded the rearguard at the entrance to the New Park. His brother Edward led the third division. The fourth division was nominally under the youthful [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter the Steward]], but actually under the command of [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Later Middle Ages pp.87–89&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish archers used yew-stave longbows and, though these were not weaker than or inferior to English longbows, there were fewer Scottish archers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Great Warbow|last=Strickland |first= Matthew|author2=Hardy,Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud |isbn= 0-7509-3167-1|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly only 500. These archers played little part in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle of Lanercost says that, on the second day of the battle, &quot;''the English archers were thrown forward before the line, and the Scottish archers engaged them, a few being killed and wounded on either side; but the King of England's archers quickly put the others to flight.''&quot; The Chronicle of Lanercost, 1272–1346: Translated, with notes by Sir Herbert Maxwell. p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; There is first-hand evidence in a poem, written just after the battle by the captured [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] friar Robert Baston, that one or both sides employed slingers and crossbowmen.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bower, ''Scotichronicon'',Book XII, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact site of the Battle of Bannockburn has been debated for many years,&lt;ref name=Battlefield&gt;{{Canmore |num=47243 |desc=Battle of Bannockburn|access-date=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most modern historians agree that the traditional site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OS 25 inch map 1892–1949, with Bing opacity slider|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&amp;lat=56.0959&amp;lon=-3.9477&amp;layers=168&amp;b=1|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a visitor centre and statue have been erected, is not correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;mackenzie&quot;&gt;Mackenzie, W.

===First day of battle===
[[File:Mapbannockburn1.svg|thumb|right|300px|An interpretation of the battle of Bannockburn—first day]]
Most medieval battles were short-lived, lasting only a few hours, so the Battle of Bannockburn is unusual in that it lasted two days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; On 23 June 1314 two English cavalry formations advanced. The first was commanded by the [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester|Earl of Gloucester]] and by the [[Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford|Earl of Hereford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

They encountered a body of Scots led by Robert the Bruce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Bruce and [[Henry de Bohun]], nephew of the Earl of Hereford, faced off in what became a celebrated instance of single combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Bohun charged at Bruce and, when the two passed side by side, Bruce split Bohun's head with his axe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, Ann. ''The Warhorse 1250–1600'', UK: Sutton Publishing, 1998, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots then rushed the English forces under Gloucester's and Hereford's command, who retreated, struggling back over the Bannockburn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishbattles.com/scottish/battle-bannockburn.htm The Battle of Bannockburn] britishbattles.com. Retrieved 14 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second English cavalry force was commanded by [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]] and [[Henry de Beaumont]].  Their forces included Sir [[Thomas Grey (of Heaton)|Thomas de Grey of Heaton]], father of the chronicler [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Thomas Grey]].  The younger Grey described the battle:&lt;section begin=Beaumont-vs-Grey /&gt;
{{quote|Robert Lord de Clifford and Henry de Beaumont, with three hundred [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], made a circuit upon the other side of the wood towards the castle, keeping the open ground. [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray]], Robert de Brus's nephew, who was leader of the Scottish advanced guard, hearing that his uncle had repulsed the advanced guard of the English on the other side of the wood, thought that he must have his share, and issuing from the wood with his division marched across the open ground towards the two afore-named lords.

Sir Henry de Beaumont called to his men: &quot;Let us wait a little; let them come on; give them room&quot;.

&quot;Sir,&quot; said Sir Thomas Gray, &quot;I doubt that whatever you give them now, they will have all too soon&quot;.

&quot;Very well&quot; exclaimed the said Henry, &quot;if you are afraid, be off&quot;.

&quot;Sir,&quot; answered the said Thomas, &quot;it is not from fear that I shall fly this day.&quot;

So saying, he spurred in between Beaumont and Sir William Deyncourt and charged into the thick of the enemy. William was killed, Thomas was taken prisoner, his horse being killed on the pikes, and he himself carried off with the Scots on foot when they marched off, having utterly routed the squadron of the said two lords. Some of the English fled to the castle, others to the king's army, which having already left the road through the wood had debouched upon a plain near the water of Forth beyond Bannockburn, an evil, deep, wet marsh, where the said English army unharnessed and remained all night, having sadly lost confidence and being too much disaffected by the events of the day.|Sir Thomas Grey|''Scalacronica'', translated by Herbert Maxwell&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxwell&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Maxwell|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;section end=Beaumont-vs-Grey /&gt;

===Second day of battle===
[[File:Mapbannockburn1.2.svg|thumb|right|300px|An interpretation of the battle of Bannockburn—second day.]]
During the night the English forces crossed the stream known as the Bannockburn, establishing their position on the plain beyond it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; A Scottish knight, [[Alexander Seton (Governor of Berwick)|Alexander Seton]], who was fighting in the service of Edward II of England, deserted the English camp and told Bruce that English morale was low and encouraged him to attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

In the morning the Scots advanced from New Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Not long after daybreak, Edward was surprised to see the Scottish pikemen emerge from the cover of the woods and advance towards his position. As Bruce's army drew nearer, they paused and knelt in prayer. Edward reportedly said in surprise, &quot;They pray for mercy!&quot; &quot;For mercy, yes,&quot; one of his attendants replied, &quot;but from God, not you. These men will conquer or die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott158&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earl of Gloucester had argued with the Earl of Hereford over who should lead the vanguard into battle. He had also tried to persuade the king that the battle should be postponed. This led the king to accuse him of cowardice. Goaded by the accusation, the Earl of Gloucester advanced to meet the Scots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Few accompanied Gloucester and, when he reached the Scottish lines, he was quickly surrounded and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt;

The English were gradually pushed back and ground down by the Scots' [[schiltron]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; The English longbowmen attempted to support the advance of the knights but were ordered to stop shooting, as they were causing [[Friendly fire|casualties among their own]]. The English then attempted to deploy their English and Welsh longbowmen to flank the advancing Scots, but they were dispersed by 500 Scottish cavalry under the Marischal [[Robert II Keith, Marischal of Scotland|Sir Robert Keith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although the Scottish cavalry is sometimes described as light cavalry, this appears to be a misinterpretation of Barbour's statement that these were men-at-arms on lighter horses than those of their English counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;(Brown, C. (2008) pp 129–130)&lt;/ref&gt;)

The English cavalry was hemmed in against the Bannockburn, making it difficult for them to manoeuvre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; Unable to hold their formations, they broke rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; It soon became clear to [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]] and [[Giles d'Argentan]] (reputedly the third-best knight in Europe) that the English had lost the battle and Edward II needed at all costs to be led to safety. Seizing the reins of the king's horse, they dragged him away, closely followed by 500 knights of the royal bodyguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott159&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once they were clear of the battle d'Argentan turned to the king and said: &quot;''Sire, your protection was committed to me, but since you are safely on your way, I will bid you farewell for never yet have I fled from a battle, nor will I now.''&quot; He turned his horse to charge back into the ranks of Scottish, where he was overborne and slain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott160&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English retreat===
Edward fled with his personal bodyguard and panic spread among the remaining troops, turning their defeat into a [[rout]]. King Edward with about 500 men first fled for Stirling Castle where Sir Philip de Moubray, commander of the castle, turned him away as the castle would shortly be surrendered to the Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrow |first1=Geoffrey W.S. |title=Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland |date=1988 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, pursued by James Douglas and a small troop of horsemen, Edward fled to [[Dunbar Castle]], from which he took a ship to Berwick. From the carnage of Bannockburn, the rest of the army tried to escape to the safety of the English border, {{convert|90 |miles}} south. Many were killed by the pursuing Scottish army or by the inhabitants of the countryside they passed through.

Historian Peter Reese wrote that &quot;only one sizeable group of men – all foot soldiers – made good their escape to England.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese1&quot;/&gt; These were a force of Welsh spearmen who were kept together by their commander, [[Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley|Sir Maurice de Berkeley]].  The majority of them reached [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese1&quot;/&gt; Weighing the available evidence, Reese concludes that &quot;it seems doubtful if even a third of the foot soldiers returned to England.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese1&quot;/&gt; If his estimate is accurate, of 16,000 English infantrymen, about 11,000 were killed. The English chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] gave the number of English men-at-arms who were killed as 700,&lt;ref name=&quot;referencing1&quot;&gt;Mackenzie, p.88 referencing Walsingham, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; while 500 more men-at-arms were spared for ransom.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish losses appear to have been comparatively light, with only two knights among those killed.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The immediate aftermath was the surrender of Stirling Castle, one of Scotland's most important fortresses, to King Robert. He then slighted it to prevent it from being retaken. Nearly as important was the surrender of Bothwell Castle where a sizeable party of English nobles, including the Earl of Hereford, had taken refuge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrow |first1=Geoffrey W.S. |title=Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland |date=1988 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for the captured nobles, Edward II released Robert's wife [[Elizabeth de Burgh]], sisters [[Christina Bruce]], [[Mary Bruce]] and daughter [[Marjorie Bruce]], and Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, ending their 8-year imprisonment in England.

The defeat of the English opened up the north of England to Scottish raids&lt;ref name=&quot;Black&quot;/&gt; and allowed the [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Scottish invasion of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;  These finally led, after the failure of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] to secure diplomatic recognition of Scotland's independence by the Pope, to the [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton]] in 1328.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Under the treaty the English crown recognised the full [[independence]] of the Kingdom of Scotland, and acknowledged Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as the rightful rulers.

===Bannockburn Visitor Centre===
[[File:MK18538 Bannockburn.jpg|thumb|The hemicircle of the modern Bannockburn monument]]

In 1932 the Bannockburn Preservation Committee, under [[Edward Bruce, 10th Earl of Elgin]] and Kincardine, presented lands to the [[National Trust for Scotland]]. Further lands were purchased in 1960 and 1965 to facilitate visitor access. A modern monument was erected in a field above the possible site of the battle, where the warring parties are believed to have camped on the night before the battle. The monument consists of two hemicircular walls depicting the opposing parties. Nearby stands the 1960s statue of Bruce by [[Pilkington Jackson]]. Although the statue was conceived by Pilkington Jackson he commissioned Thomas Taylor Bowie of the Ontario College of Art in Toronto to create the statue. The monument, and the associated visitor centre, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area. The battlefield has been included in the [[Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland]] and protected by [[Historic Scotland]] under the Historic Environment (Amendment) Act 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/battlefields/battlefieldsunderconsideration.htm |title=Inventory battlefields|publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lelystad''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈleːlistɑt|-|256 Lelystad.ogg}}) is a [[municipality]] and a [[city]] in the centre of the [[Netherlands]], and it is the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[province]] of [[Flevoland]]. The city, built on reclaimed land, was founded in 1967 and was named after [[Cornelis Lely]], who engineered the [[Afsluitdijk]], making the reclamation possible. Lelystad is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} [[below sea level]].

==History==
Lelystad is built on the seabed of the former [[Zuiderzee]]. About 6500 years ago this wetland was above high tide level and inhabited; the Netherlands have steadily subsided since. Near Lelystad at [[Swifterbant]], the oldest [[human skeleton]]s in Western Europe were discovered. Due to [[Floods in the Netherlands|rising water levels and storms]], the [[peat]]lands were washed away, and the [[Lake Flevo|Lacus Flevo]] (in Roman times) grew to be the [[Almere (lake)|Almere]] (Middle Ages) and became the [[Zuiderzee]]. The Zuiderzee (Southern Sea) was the main transport route from [[Amsterdam]] to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Hanseatic League]] cities. Due to the many [[shipwreck]]s in Flevoland, Lelystad now houses the National Centre for Maritime [[History]], with a [[museum]] and the [[shipyard]] that has built the [[Batavia (1628 ship)|Batavia]] replica.

[[File:Lelystad sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Sunset over the IJsselmeer, bordering Lelystad.]]
After the Second World War the [[Zuiderzee Works]] continued, constructing the [[polder]] of Eastern Flevoland. In 1950 work commenced on several construction islands in the middle of the [[IJsselmeer]]. ''Lelystad-Haven'' was the largest island, and its wooden barracks housed a community of dyke-builders. In 1955 they reached the mainland, which made it possible to drive to Lelystad by car. One of the three [[pumping station]]s, which drained the polder in June 1957, was the diesel-powered ''Wortman'' in Lelystad-Haven. Until 1967 the only inhabitants of Lelystad were technical [[engineer]]s and [[laborer]]s and superintendents, living on the former construction island.

==Landscape==
[[File:Lelystad-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Dutch topographic map of Lelystad (city), March 2014]]
Lelystad is the largest municipality in the Netherlands in area, but a large part of that area is water: [[Markermeer]] and [[IJsselmeer]]. Another major area is the internationally famous nature park of [[Oostvaardersplassen]], which arose naturally when the polder of ''South Flevoland'' was drained. Lelystad is also surrounded by a square of woodlands and parks and flat farmland. The importance of the landscape and sky is emphasized by several pieces of [[land art]]: engineers' work and works such as the ''Observatorium'' by Robert Morris (see below).

The artificial islands of [[Marker Wadden]] lie immediately to the northwest of Lelystad. Construction started in 2016, and the first islands have already become important wildlife sites, with many species of birds coming to the islands during the breeding season.

==Tourism==
Lelystad has several tourist attractions, including:
* The replica of the 17th-century ship ''[[Batavia (1628 ship)|Batavia]]'' at the Batavia Shipyard
* [[Batavia Stad Fashion Outlet]]
* Hanzestad Compagnie, a fleet of historical sailing ships
* Lelystad Nature Park
* [[Aviodrome|National Aviation Theme Park Aviodrome]]
* Modern architecture, for example the [[Zilverparkkade]] and Agora Theatre
* The oldest tree of Flevoland

Lelystad hosts many one-day events like the Lelystad Airshow, the Water Festival, the National Old Timer Day, Lelystad Speedway, Architecture day and several sports events. On the Midland Circuit many [[auto racing|motor]], [[kart racing|kart]] and [[stock car racing]] events and several autoclub meetings are held. On the coast there are several marinas.

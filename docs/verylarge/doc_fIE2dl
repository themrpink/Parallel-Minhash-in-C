Cooper's performance — playing an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman — was singled out for its versatility&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper changed his name legally to &quot;Gary Cooper&quot; in August 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for the Civil War [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Operator 13]]'' with [[Marion Davies]], about a beautiful Union spy who falls in love with a Confederate soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Richard Boleslawski]]'s imaginative direction and [[George J. Folsey]]'s lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-171&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director [[Henry Hathaway]],&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-107&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Now and Forever (1934 film)|Now and Forever]]'', with Carole Lombard and [[Shirley Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 123–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-107&quot; /&gt;{{refn|Cooper bought the child actress toys and taught her how to draw using colored pencils during setups.

The following year, Cooper was loaned out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions to appear in [[King Vidor]]'s [[romance film]] ''[[The Wedding Night]]'' with [[Anna Sten]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-126-128&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; who was being groomed as &quot;another [[Greta Garbo|Garbo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays an alcoholic novelist who retreats to his family's New England farm where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polish neighbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-126-128&quot; /&gt; Cooper delivered a performance of surprising range and depth, according to biographer Larry Swindell.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-179&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving generally favorable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; the film was not popular with American audiences, who may have been offended by the film's depiction of an extramarital affair and its tragic ending.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-179&quot; /&gt;

That same year, Cooper appeared in two Henry Hathaway films: the [[melodrama]] ''[[Peter Ibbetson]]'' with [[Ann Harding]], about a man caught up in a dream world created by his love for a childhood sweetheart,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 132–35.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[adventure film]] ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)|The Lives of a Bengal Lancer]]'', about a daring British officer and his men who defend their stronghold at [[Bengal]] against rebellious local tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; While the former was more successful in Europe than in the United States, the latter was nominated for seven Academy Awards&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of Cooper's most popular and successful adventure films.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Hathaway had the highest respect for Cooper's acting ability, calling him &quot;the best actor of all of them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-107&quot; /&gt;

Cooper's career took an important turn in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-116&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; After making [[Frank Borzage]]'s [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Desire (1936 film)|Desire]]'' with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount—in which he delivered a performance considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-116&quot; /&gt;—Cooper returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent film days to make [[Frank Capra]]'s  ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' with [[Jean Arthur]] for [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays the character of Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New York where he faces a world of corruption and deceit.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Capra and screenwriter [[Robert Riskin]] were able to use Cooper's well-established screen persona as the &quot;quintessential American hero&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-116&quot; /&gt;—a symbol of honesty, courage, and goodness&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-119&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-192&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;—to create a new type of &quot;[[folk hero]]&quot; for the common man.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-116&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Cooper's impact on the character and the film, Capra observed:{{quote|As soon as I thought of Gary Cooper, it wasn't possible to conceive anyone else in the role. He could not have been any closer to my idea of Longfellow Deeds, and as soon as he could think in terms of Cooper, Bob Riskin found it easier to develop the Deeds character in terms of dialogue. So it just had to be Cooper. Every line in his face spelled honesty. Our Mr. Deeds had to symbolize uncorruptibility, and in my mind Gary Cooper was that symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both ''Desire'' and ''Mr. Deeds'' opened in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box-office successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-121&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review in ''The New York Times'', [[Frank Nugent]] wrote that Cooper was &quot;proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes-deeds&quot; /&gt; For his performance in ''Mr. Deeds'', Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscars-1937&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Gary Cooper in The Plainsman 1936.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Screen capture of Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur|Cooper and Jean Arthur in ''The Plainsman'', 1936]]
Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936. In [[Lewis Milestone]]'s adventure film ''[[The General Died at Dawn]]'' with [[Madeleine Carroll]], he plays an American soldier of fortune in China who helps the peasants defend themselves against the oppression of a cruel [[warlord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-144-146&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 144–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Written by playwright [[Clifford Odets]], the film was a critical and commercial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-144-146&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s sprawling frontier epic ''[[The Plainsman]]''—his first of four films with the director—Cooper portrays [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in a highly fictionalized version of the opening of the American western frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 147–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was an even greater box-office hit than its predecessor,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; due in large part to Jean Arthur's definitive depiction of [[Calamity Jane]] and Cooper's inspired portrayal of Hickock as an enigmatic figure of &quot;deepening mythic substance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Cooper appeared for the first time on the ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'' exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities, where he would remain for the next twenty-three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-147&quot; /&gt;

In late 1936, Paramount was preparing a new contract for Cooper that would raise his salary to $8,000 a week&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; when Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn for six films over six years with a minimum guarantee of $150,000 per picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-126&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount brought suit against Goldwyn and Cooper, and the court ruled that Cooper's new Goldwyn contract afforded the actor sufficient time to also honor his Paramount agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper continued to make films with both studios, and by 1939 the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] reported that Cooper was the country's highest wage earner, at $482,819 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.482819|1939|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-126&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film ''[[Souls at Sea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 150–52.&lt;/ref&gt; A critical and box-office failure,&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-205&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper referred to it as his &quot;almost picture&quot;, saying, &quot;It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-205&quot; /&gt; In 1938, he appeared in [[Archie Mayo]]'s biographical film ''[[The Adventures of Marco Polo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 153–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-132&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles,&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; including the role of [[Rhett Butler]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;selznick-172-173&quot;&gt;Selznick 2000, pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was producer [[David O.

[[File:Bluebeards-eighth-wife.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert|Cooper and [[Claudette Colbert]] in ''Bluebeard's Eighth Wife'', 1938]]
Back at Paramount, Cooper returned to a more comfortable genre in [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' (1938) with Claudette Colbert.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-132&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-156-158&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 156–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the clever screenplay by [[Charles Brackett]] and [[Billy Wilder]],&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-154&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert,&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-156-158&quot; /&gt; American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. It succeeded only at the European box office market.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-154&quot; /&gt;

In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in [[H. C. Potter]]'s romantic comedy ''[[The Cowboy and the Lady (1938 film)|The Cowboy and the Lady]]'' with [[Merle Oberon]], about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 159–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a fine vehicle for Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-135&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next two years, Cooper was more discerning about the roles he accepted and made four successful large-scale adventure and cowboy films.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-135&quot; /&gt; In [[William A.

In [[Henry Hathaway]]'s ''[[The Real Glory]]'' (1939), he plays a military doctor who accompanies a small group of American Army officers to the Philippines to help the Christian Filipinos defend themselves against Muslim radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 166–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Many film critics praised Cooper's performance, including author and film critic [[Graham Greene]], who recognized that he &quot;never acted better&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-138&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== From ''The Westerner'' to ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'', 1940–1943 ====
Cooper returned to the Western genre in [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Westerner (1940 film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Doris Davenport]], about a drifting cowboy who defends homesteaders against [[Roy Bean]], a corrupt judge known as the &quot;law west of the [[Pecos River|Pecos]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-138&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 169–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter [[Niven Busch]] relied on Cooper's extensive knowledge of [[American frontier|Western]] history while working on the script.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received positive reviews and did well at the box-office,&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-226&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; with reviewers praising the performances of the two lead actors.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Cooper appeared in his first all-[[Technicolor]] feature,&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil B.

The early 1940s were Cooper's prime years as an actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-14&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In a relatively short period, he appeared in five critically successful and popular films that produced some of his finest performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-14&quot; /&gt; When Frank Capra offered him the lead role in ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' before [[Robert Riskin]] even developed the script, Cooper accepted his friend's offer, saying, &quot;It's okay, Frank, I don't need a script.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-144&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays Long John Willoughby, a down-and-out bush-league pitcher hired by a newspaper to pretend to be a man who promises to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to protest all the hypocrisy and corruption in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered by some critics to be Capra's best film at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-230&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Meet John Doe'' was received as a &quot;national event&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-230&quot; /&gt; with Cooper appearing on the front cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on March 3, 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-146-147&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review in the ''New York Herald Tribune'', Howard Barnes called Cooper's performance a &quot;splendid and utterly persuasive portrayal&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and praised his &quot;utterly realistic acting which comes through with such authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-146-147&quot; /&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]], in ''The New York Times'', wrote, &quot;Gary Cooper, of course, is 'John Doe' to the life and in the whole—shy, bewildered, non-aggressive, but a veritable tiger when aroused.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes-meet&quot; /&gt;

Cooper concluded the year back at Goldwyn with Howard Hawks to make the romantic comedy ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' with [[Barbara Stanwyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 184–86.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia. While researching slang, he meets Stanwyck's flirtatious burlesque stripper Sugarpuss O'Shea who blows the dust off their staid life of books.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-161&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise the full range of his light comedy skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-161&quot; /&gt; In his review for the ''New York Herald Tribune'', Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with &quot;great skill and comic emphasis&quot; and that his performance was &quot;utterly delightful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Though small in scale, ''Ball of Fire'' was one of the top-grossing films of the year&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-179&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;—Cooper's fourth consecutive picture to make the top twenty.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-179&quot; /&gt;

Cooper's only film appearance in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn contract.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sam Wood]]'s biographical film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper portrays baseball star [[Lou Gehrig]] who established a record with the [[New York Yankees]] for playing in 2,130 consecutive games.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was reluctant to play the seven-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], who only died the previous year from [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) — now commonly called &quot;Lou Gehrig's disease&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-163&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying such a popular and nationally recognized figure, Cooper knew very little about baseball&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-238&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and was not left-handed like Gehrig.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-163&quot; /&gt;

After Gehrig's widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-163&quot; /&gt; Cooper accepted the role that covered a twenty-year span of Gehrig's life—his early love of baseball, his rise to greatness, his loving marriage, and his struggle with illness, culminating in his farewell speech at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on July 4, 1939 before 62,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper quickly learned the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid, believable swing.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[handedness]] issue was solved by reversing the print for certain batting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was one of the year's top ten pictures&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot; /&gt; and received eleven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Cooper's third).&lt;ref name=&quot;oscars-1943&quot; /&gt;

Soon after the publication of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', Paramount paid $150,000 for the film rights with the express intent of casting Cooper in the lead role of Robert Jordan,&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-183&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an American explosives expert who fights alongside the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] loyalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The original director, Cecil B.

Due to his age and health, Cooper did not serve in the military during World War II,&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-14&quot; /&gt; but like many of his colleagues, he got involved in the [[war effort]] by entertaining the troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1943, he visited military hospitals in San Diego,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot; /&gt; and often appeared at the [[Hollywood Canteen]] serving food to the servicemen.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-189&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1943, Cooper undertook a {{convert|23000|mi|km|adj=mid}} tour of the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] with actresses [[Una Merkel]] and [[Phyllis Brooks]], and accordionist Andy Arcari.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-189&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-250&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling on a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24A Liberator]] bomber,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot; /&gt; the group toured the [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Queensland]], [[Brisbane]]—where General [[Douglas MacArthur]] told Cooper he was watching ''Sergeant York'' in a Manila theater when Japanese bombs began falling&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-167&quot; /&gt;—[[New Guinea]], [[Jayapura]], and throughout the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 167–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group often shared the same sparse living conditions and [[K-ration]]s as the troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-169&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper met with the servicemen and women, visited military hospitals, introduced his attractive colleagues, and participated in occasional skits.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-169&quot; /&gt; The shows concluded with Cooper's moving recitation of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-169&quot; /&gt; When he returned to the United States, he visited military hospitals throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-169&quot; /&gt; Cooper later called his time with the troops the &quot;greatest emotional experience&quot; of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-250&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Gary Cooper in Along Came Jones 1945.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Screen capture of Gary Cooper and Loretta Young|Cooper and [[Loretta Young]] in ''Along Came Jones'', 1945]]
In 1944, Cooper appeared in Cecil B.

Cooper's career during the post-war years drifted in new directions as American society was changing. While he still played conventional heroic roles, his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel 1985, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1945, Cooper appeared in Sam Wood's nineteenth-century period drama ''[[Saratoga Trunk]]'' with [[Ingrid Bergman]], about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune-hunter.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-201-203&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 201–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed in early 1943, the movie's release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite poor reviews, ''Saratoga Trunk'' did well at the box office&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the top money-makers of the year for Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper's only film in 1946 was [[Fritz Lang]]'s romantic thriller ''[[Cloak and Dagger (1946 film)|Cloak and Dagger]]'', about a mild-mannered physics professor recruited by the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-204-205&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a part loosely based on physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], Cooper was uneasy with the role and unable to convey the &quot;inner sense&quot; of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 195–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received poor reviews and was a box-office failure.&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille's epic adventure film ''[[Unconquered (1947 film)|Unconquered]]'' with [[Paulette Goddard]], about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 206–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mixed reviews, but even long-time DeMille critic [[James Agee]] acknowledged the picture had &quot;some authentic flavor of the period&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-220&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper's most lucrative, earning the actor over $300,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1947}}}} today) in salary and percentage of profits.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unconquered'' would be his last unqualified box-office success for the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-220&quot; /&gt;

During this period, Cooper struggled with health problems. As well as his ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of ''Blowing Wild'' when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-269&quot; /&gt; During the filming of ''Vera Cruz'', he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-269&quot; /&gt;

In 1955, he appeared in [[Otto Preminger]]'s biographical war drama ''[[The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell]]'', about the [[Billy Mitchell|World War I general]] who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 252–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 275–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana [[Quaker]] in [[William Wyler]]'s Civil War drama ''[[Friendly Persuasion (1956 film)|Friendly Persuasion]]'' with [[Dorothy McGuire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 255–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Sergeant York'' and ''High Noon'', the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-281&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1957 Cannes Film Festival]], and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-281&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arce 1979, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Cooper traveled to France to make Billy Wilder's romantic comedy ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-317&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cooper plays a middle-aged American playboy in Paris who pursues and eventually falls in love with a much younger woman.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 259–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving some positive reviews—including from Bosley Crowther who praised the film's &quot;charming performances&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-261&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;—most reviewers concluded that Cooper was simply too old for the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-260&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; While audiences may not have welcomed seeing Cooper's heroic screen image tarnished by his playing an aging [[Rake (character)|roué]] trying to seduce an innocent young girl, the film was still a box-office success.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-260&quot; /&gt; The following year, Cooper appeared in [[Philip Dunne (writer)|Philip Dunne]]'s romantic drama ''[[Ten North Frederick (film)|Ten North Frederick]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-262-264&quot;&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 262–64.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, which was based on the [[Ten North Frederick|novel]] by [[John O'Hara]],&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-289&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper plays an attorney whose life is ruined by a double-crossing politician and his own secret affair with his daughter's young roommate.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickens-262-264&quot; /&gt; While Cooper brought &quot;conviction and controlled anguish&quot; to his performance, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-289&quot; /&gt; it was not enough to save what Bosley Crowther called a &quot;hapless film&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-264&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gary Cooper in Man of the West 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Screen capture of Gary Cooper|Cooper in ''Man of the West'', 1958]]
Despite his ongoing health problems and several operations for ulcers and [[hernia]]s, Cooper continued to work in action films.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-291&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he appeared in [[Anthony Mann]]'s Western drama ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958) with [[Julie London]] and [[Lee J. Cobb]], about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been called Cooper's &quot;most pathological Western&quot;, with its themes of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-289&quot; /&gt; According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, &quot;understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity ... [and] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly ignored by critics at the time, the film is now well-regarded by film scholars&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered Cooper's last great film.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-264&quot; /&gt;

After his Warner Bros. contract ended, Cooper formed his own production company, Baroda Productions, and made three unusual films in 1959 about redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 291, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; In Delmer Daves' Western drama ''[[The Hanging Tree]]'', Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob, and later tries to exploit his sordid past.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 267–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper delivered a &quot;powerful and persuasive&quot; performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 296–97.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Robert Rossen]]'s historical adventure ''[[They Came to Cordura]]'' with [[Rita Hayworth]], he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 271–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Cooper received positive reviews, ''Variety'' and ''Films in Review'' felt he was too old for the part.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]]'s action drama ''[[The Wreck of the Mary Deare (film)|The Wreck of the Mary Deare]]'' with [[Charlton Heston]], Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens 1970, pp. 274–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Like its two predecessors, the film was physically demanding.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-299&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper, who was a trained scuba diver, did most of his own underwater scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-299&quot; /&gt; Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles, Cooper effectively conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemption&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-301&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;—what [[Joseph Conrad]] in ''[[Lord Jim]]'' called the &quot;struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-301&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conrad 1992, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 104–05, 153, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, pp. 300–01.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 59, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-285-286&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper owned several works by [[Pablo Picasso]], whom he met in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-285-286&quot; /&gt; Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 [[Duesenberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-59&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-53&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-53&quot; /&gt; with an occasional &quot;yup&quot; and &quot;shucks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-303&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He once said, &quot;If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-54&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-54&quot; /&gt; He was modest and unpretentious,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-53&quot; /&gt; frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminsky 1979, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-54&quot; /&gt; Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-55&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, &quot;Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-55&quot; /&gt;

=== Political views ===
Like his father, Cooper was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]; he voted for [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for [[Wendell Willkie]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-202&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting &quot;foreign&quot; ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-206&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio address that he paid for himself just prior to the election,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-206&quot; /&gt; Cooper said, &quot;I disagree with the [[New Deal]] belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't even seem to work any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-206&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpozi 1970, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended a Republican rally at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 2011, pp. 231–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]],&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement of principles, to preserving the &quot;American way of life&quot; and opposing [[communism]] and [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alliance&quot; /&gt; The organization — whose membership included [[Walter Brennan]], [[Laraine Day]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and [[John Wayne]] — advised the [[United States Congress]] to investigate communist influence in the motion picture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 1947, Cooper was subpoenaed to appear before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed any &quot;communistic influence&quot; in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia&quot; /&gt;

Cooper recounted statements he'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution—comments that Cooper said he found to be &quot;very un-American&quot; and testified that he had rejected several scripts because he thought they were &quot;tinged with communist ideas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia&quot; /&gt; Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals, nor did he name any scripts, during his testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, while making ''High Noon'', Cooper became friends with the film's screenwriter, [[Carl Foreman]], who had been a member of the Communist Party. When Foreman was subpoenaed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], Cooper put his career on the line to defend Foreman. When [[John Wayne]] and others threatened Cooper with blacklisting himself and the loss of his passport if he did not walk off the film, Cooper gave a statement to the press in support of Foreman, calling him &quot;the finest kind of American&quot;. When producer [[Stanley Kramer]] removed Foreman's name as screenwriter, Cooper and director [[Fred Zinnemann]] threatened to walk off the film if Foreman's name was not restored. Foreman later said that, of all his friends and allies and colleagues in Hollywood, &quot;Cooper was the only big one who tried to help. The only one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nast |first1=Condé |title=High Noon's Secret Backstory |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/high-noons-secret-backstory |website=Vanity Fair |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper even offered to testify in Foreman's behalf before the committee, but character witnesses were not allowed. Foreman always sent future scripts to Cooper for first refusal, including ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]], [[The Key (1958 film)|The Key]]'' and ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]''. Cooper had to turn them down because of his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best books of 2017: The best nonfiction |url=https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-holiday-books-best-nonfiction-20171130-htmlstory.html |website=Los Angeles Times |date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Cooper was baptized in the Anglican Church in December 1911 in Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-13&quot; /&gt; and was raised in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;carpozi-205&quot;&gt;Carpozi 1970, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; While he was not an observant Christian for most of his adult life, many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual side.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-293&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1953, Cooper accompanied his wife and daughter, who were devout Catholics,&lt;ref name=&quot;carpozi-207&quot;&gt;Carpozi 1970, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; to Rome, where they had an audience with [[Pope Pius XII]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-266&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper and his wife were still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Carpozi 1970, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior,&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-293&quot; /&gt; and started discussing [[Catholicism]] with his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;carpozi-207&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; He began attending church with them regularly,&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-293&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the [[Church of the Good Shepherd (Beverly Hills, California)|Church of the Good Shepherd]] in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;carpozi-205&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt;

On April 14, 1960, Cooper underwent surgery at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston for an aggressive form of [[prostate cancer]] that had metastasized to his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-304&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-304&quot; /&gt; After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation to the south of France&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; before traveling to the UK in the fall to star in ''[[The Naked Edge]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-304&quot; /&gt; In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary ''The Real West'',&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-308&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the company's ''Project 20'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-276&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In March 1961, Cooper traveled to New York to record the off-camera narration for the documentary—his last work as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's cancer had spread to his [[lung cancer|lungs]] and [[bone cancer|bones]] and was inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 308, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; His family decided not to tell him immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;janis-164&quot;&gt;Janis 1999, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 1961, Cooper attended a dinner that was given in his honor and hosted by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]] at the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-308&quot; /&gt; The dinner was attended by many of his industry friends&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, pp. 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, &quot;The only achievement I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Swindell 1980, pp. 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together.&lt;ref name=&quot;janis-164&quot; /&gt; Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; He later told his family, &quot;We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Janis 1999, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-314&quot;&gt;Meyers 1998, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Holding back tears, Stewart said, &quot;Coop, I'll get this to you right away. And Coop, I want you to know this, that with this goes all the warm friendship and the affection and the admiration and the deep, the deep respect of all of us. We're very, very proud of you, Coop. All of us are tremendously proud.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-314&quot; /&gt;{{refn|The award dedication read, &quot;To Gary Cooper for his many memorable screen performances and the international recognition he, as an individual, has gained for the motion picture industry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oscars-1961&quot; /&gt;|group=Note}} The following day, newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyers-315&quot; /&gt; In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from [[Pope John XXIII]]&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-278&quot;&gt;Arce 1979, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; and Queen [[Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref name=&quot;swindell-303&quot;&gt;Swindell 1980, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arce-278&quot; /&gt; and a telephone call from President [[John F.

In his last public statement on May 4, Cooper said, &quot;I know that what is happening is God's will. I am not afraid of the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tuscaloosa-battling&quot; /&gt; He received the [[Last rites#In the Latin Catholic church|last rites]] on May 12.

'''Sharks''' are a group of [[elasmobranch]] [[fish]] characterized by a [[Chondrichthyes#Skeleton|cartilaginous skeleton]], five to seven [[gill slit]]s on the sides of the [[head]], and [[pectoral fin]]s that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the [[clade]] '''Selachimorpha''' (or '''Selachii''') and are the [[sister group]] to the [[Batoidea|rays]]. However, the term &quot;shark&quot; has also been used for extinct members of the subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] outside the Selachimorpha, such as ''[[Cladoselache]]'' and ''[[Xenacanthus]]'', as well as other [[Chondrichthyes]] such as the [[holocephalid]] [[Eugeneodontida|eugenedontidans]].

Under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;RQGT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Well-known species such as the [[tiger shark]], [[blue shark]], [[great white shark]], [[Isurus|mako shark]], [[thresher shark]], and [[hammerhead shark]] are [[apex predator]]s—organisms at the top of their underwater [[food chain]]. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still evidential in several species termed &quot;[[Squalidae|dogfish]],&quot; or the [[porbeagle]].

The etymology of the word &quot;shark&quot; is uncertain, the most likely etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of &quot;predator, one who preys on others&quot; from the Dutch ''schurk'', meaning &quot;villain, scoundrel&quot; (cf. ''card shark'', ''loan shark'', etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, shark.&lt;/ref&gt;

A now disproven{{Original research inline|date=August 2020}} theory is that it derives from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word ''xok'' (pronounced 'shok'), meaning &quot;fish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Evidence for this etymology came from the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which notes ''shark'' first came into use after Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]' sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and posted &quot;''sharke''&quot; to refer to the large sharks of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. However, the [[Middle English Dictionary]] records an isolated occurrence of the word ''shark'' (referring to a sea fish) in a letter written by [[Thomas Beckington]] in 1442, which rules out a New World etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shark|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED39794&amp;egs=all&amp;egdisplay=open|work=Middle English Dictionary|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=2014-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820110832/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED39794&amp;egs=all&amp;egdisplay=open|archive-date=2013-08-20|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=August 2020}}

Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the [[Ordovician]] period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;RQGT&quot;/&gt; Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of [[thelodont]] agnathans.&lt;ref name=&quot;RQES&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=R.

The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;RQMS&quot;/&gt; Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized [[calcium phosphate]], an [[apatite]]. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.

Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is ''[[Cladoselache]]'', from about 370 million years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;RQA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=R. Aidan |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/ancient.htm |title=Ancient Sharks |publisher=ReefQuest |access-date=2006-09-09 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Czf9hGGw?url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/evolution/ancient.htm |archive-date=2012-12-18 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been found within [[Paleozoic]] strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. ''Cladoselache'' was only about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;RQA&quot; /&gt; Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From the small number of teeth found together, it is most likely that ''Cladoselache'' did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the [[great white shark]]s and the pelagic [[Shortfin mako shark|shortfin]] and [[Longfin mako shark|longfin makos]]. The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.

Most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. The [[Xenacanthida]] was almost exclusive to freshwater environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/sharks/P2-3.htm &quot;Xenacanth&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107033634/http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/sharks/P2-3.htm |date=2007-01-07 }}.

The superorder Selachimorpha is divided into Galea (or [[Galeomorphii]]), and Squalea (or [[Squalomorphii]]). The Galeans are the [[Bullhead shark|Heterodontiformes]], [[Carpet shark|Orectolobiformes]], [[Lamniformes]], and [[Carcharhiniformes]]. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one [[clade]], but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some scientists now think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean. The Squaleans are divided into [[Hexanchiformes]] and Squalomorpha. The former includes [[cow shark]] and [[frilled shark]], though some authors propose both families to be moved to separate orders. The Squalomorpha contains the [[Squaliformes]] and the Hypnosqualea. The Hypnosqualea may be invalid. It includes the [[Angel shark|Squatiniformes]], and the Pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the [[Sawshark|Pristiophoriformes]] and the [[Batoidea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taxonomy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CompagnoFAO&quot;/&gt;

===Teeth===
{{Main|Shark tooth}}
[[File:Tiger shark teeth.jpg|thumb|The teeth of [[tiger shark]]s are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh|alt=The serrated teeth of a [[tiger shark]], used for sawing through flesh]]

Shark teeth are embedded in the [[Gingiva|gums]] rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a [[conveyor belt]]; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the [[Isistius|cookiecutter shark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tooth shape depends on the shark's diet: those that feed on [[mollusk]]s and [[crustacean]]s have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as [[mammal]]s have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with [[serration|serrated]] edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbertson&quot; /&gt;

===Skeleton===
Shark skeletons are very different from those of [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[tetrapod|terrestrial vertebrates]]. Sharks and other [[chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] ([[Skate (fish)|skate]]s and [[batoidea|rays]]) have skeletons made of [[cartilage]] and [[connective tissue]]. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;skeletoncorset&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jaw===
The [[jaw]]s of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the [[cranium]]. The jaw's surface (in comparison to the shark's vertebrae and gill arches) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called &quot;[[tesserae]]&quot;, which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| oclc = 39217534}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.

Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;skeletoncorset&quot;/&gt; In the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.

===Fins===
Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamlett|first=William C.|title=Sharks, skates, and rays: the biology of elasmobranch fishes|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=p 56|date=April 23, 1999|edition=1|page=528|isbn=978-0-8018-6048-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON-sPP5rowwC&amp;q=shark%20fin%20%20ceratotrichia%20supported&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.&lt;ref name=langoni/&gt;

===Dermal denticles===
{{See|Fish scale#Placoid scales}}
[[File:Denticules cutanés du requin citron Negaprion brevirostris vus au microscope électronique à balayage.jpg|thumb|The dermal denticles of a [[lemon shark]], viewed through a [[scanning electron microscope]] |alt=The dermal denticles of a lemon shark]]

Unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy.&lt;ref name=Cartilagious&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/p_cartilage.htm|title=The Importance of Being Cartilaginous|last=Martin|first=R.

===Tails===
[[Tail]]s provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. [[Caudal fin]] shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a [[wiktionary:heterocercal|heterocercal]] caudal fin in which the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] portion is usually noticeably larger than the [[ventral]] portion. This is because the shark's [[vertebral column]] extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a [[wiktionary:homocercal|homocercal]] caudal fin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701777/session1.html|title=Jaws: The Natural History of Sharks|last=Michael|first=Bright|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=2009-08-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511000030/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701777/session1.html|archive-date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger sharks have a large upper [[lobe (anatomy)|lobe]], which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the [[Porbeagle|porbeagle shark]], which hunts schooling fish such as [[mackerel]] and [[herring]], has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.

==Physiology==

===Buoyancy===
Unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains [[squalene]], and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone.&lt;ref name=Cartilagious/&gt; Their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-00-713610-0
|oclc=183136093
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ [[dynamic lift (fish)|dynamic lift]] to maintain depth while swimming. [[Sand tiger shark]]s store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder.  Bottom-dwelling sharks, like the [[nurse shark]], have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.

Some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of [[tonic immobility]]. Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.&lt;ref name=ParttGruberTaniuchi&gt;{{cite book

===Respiration===
Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their [[gill]]s. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. A modified slit called a [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]] lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during [[Aquatic respiration|respiration]] and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks. Spiracles are reduced or missing in active [[pelagic]] sharks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbertson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn= 978-0-07-237716-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as &quot;ram ventilation&quot;. While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are ''obligate ram ventilators'' and would presumably [[asphyxiate]] if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The respiration and [[Circulatory system|circulation]] process begins when deoxygenated [[blood]] travels to the shark's two-chambered [[heart]]. Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral [[aorta]] [[artery]] where it branches into [[wikt:afferent#Adjective|afferent]] [[Arm|brachial]] arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the [[wikt:efferent#Adjective|efferent]] brachial arteries, which come together to form the [[dorsal aorta]]. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the [[posterior cardinal vein]]s and enters the posterior cardinal [[Anal sinuses|sinuses]]. From there blood enters the heart [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and the cycle repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&amp;-rays/anatomy.htm|title=SHARKS &amp; RAYS, SeaWorld/Busch Gardens ANIMALS, CIRCULATORY SYSTEM|publisher=Busch Entertainment Corporation|access-date=2009-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424033204/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-%26-rays/anatomy.htm|archive-date=2009-04-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermoregulation===
Most sharks are &quot;cold-blooded&quot; or, more precisely, [[poikilotherm]]ic, meaning that their internal [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] matches that of their ambient environment. Members of the family [[Lamnidae]] (such as the [[shortfin mako shark]] and the [[great white shark]]) are [[homeothermy|homeothermic]] and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. In these sharks, a strip of [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic]] red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism by a system of [[blood vessel]]s called the [[rete mirabile]] (&quot;miraculous net&quot;). The [[common thresher]] and [[bigeye thresher]] sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Osmoregulation===
In contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the [[coelacanth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=35431|doi=10.1098/rspb.1980.0054|pmid=6106196|title=Chemistry of the Body Fluids of the Coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=208|issue=1172|pages=329–347|year=1980|last1=Griffith|first1=R. W|bibcode=1980RSPSB.208..329G|s2cid=38498079}}&lt;/ref&gt; the blood and other tissue of sharks and [[Chondrichthyes]] is generally [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] to their marine environments because of the high concentration of [[urea]] (up to 2.5%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkproject.org/haiothek/index_e.php?site=anatomie_2|title=Sharkproject|access-date=31 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031932/http://www.sharkproject.org/haiothek/index_e.php?site=anatomie_2|archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[trimethylamine]] N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in [[osmotic]] balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the [[bull shark]], which has developed a way to change its [[kidney]] function to excrete large amounts of urea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Research in 1930 by [[Homer W. Smith]] showed that sharks' urine doesn't contain sufficient sodium to avoid [[hypernatremia]], and it was postulated that there must be an additional mechanism for salt secretion. In 1960 it was discovered at the [[Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory]] in [[Salsbury Cove, Maine]] that sharks have a type of [[salt gland]] located at the end of the intestine, known as the &quot;rectal gland&quot;, whose function is the secretion of chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=John N.

===Digestion===
Digestion can take a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digestion&quot;&gt;{{cite web

One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the [[spiral valve]] with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Digestion&quot;/&gt;

=== Biofluoresence ===
[[Fluorescence|Biofluorescence]] is a characteristic of a few shark species, such as the [[swell shark]] and the [[chain catshark]], the mechanism of which is unique among marine animals and depends upon a small molecule [[metabolite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.genengnews.com/magazine/september-2019-vol-39-no-9/|title=Marine Biofluorescence May Lead to Better Molecular Imaging Tools|last=Staff|date=September 2019|work=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News|access-date=14 September 2019|publisher=Mary Ann Leibert, Inc.|issue=9|volume=39|page=9|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shell.cas.usf.edu/motta/Gardiner%20and%20Atema%202010.pdf The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308032620/http://shell.cas.usf.edu/motta/Gardiner%20and%20Atema%202010.pdf |date=2012-03-08 }}, Jayne M. Gardiner, Jelle Atema, Current Biology - 13 July 2010 (Vol. 20, Issue 13, pp. 1187-1191)&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.

They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in [[sewage]] outfalls. Some species, such as [[nurse shark]]s, have external [[barbels]] that greatly increase their ability to sense prey.

===Sight===
[[File:Hexanchus nakamurai JNC2615 Eye.JPG|thumb|left|Eye of a [[Bigeyed sixgill shark]] (''Hexanchus nakamurai'')]]
Shark [[eye]]s are similar to the eyes of other [[vertebrates]], including similar [[lens (anatomy)|lenses]], [[cornea]]s and [[retina]]s, though their eyesight is well adapted to the [[ocean|marine]] environment with the help of a tissue called [[tapetum lucidum]]. This tissue is behind the [[retina]] and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger [[nocturnal]] adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their [[pupil]]s, like humans, something no [[teleost fish]] can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have [[nictitating membrane]]s. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that [[electroreception|electro-]] and [[chemoreception]] are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between [[monocular]] and [[stereoscopic]] at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Spectrophotometry|micro-spectrophotometry]] study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only [[Rod cell|rod photoreceptors]] and no cone cells in their [[retina]]s giving them good night vision while making them [[colorblind]]. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of [[Cone cell|cone photoreceptor]] sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/sharks-are-colour-blind-new-study-finds.htm|title=Sharks are colour-blind, new study finds|access-date=2011-02-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124150604/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/sharks-are-colour-blind-new-study-finds.htm|archive-date=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing===
Although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp [[Hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]] and can possibly hear prey from many miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the [[inner ear]] through a thin channel. The [[lateral line]] shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line [[Canal pore|pores]]. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and [[tetrapod]]s the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.

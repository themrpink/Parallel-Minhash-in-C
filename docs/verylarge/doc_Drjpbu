Emulsifying garlic with olive oil produces ''[[aioli]]''. Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce ''[[skordalia]]''. Blending garlic, [[almond]], oil, and soaked bread produces ''[[ajoblanco]]''. ''[[Tzatziki]]'', yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.

===Storage===
[[File:Allium sativum. Restra de allos de Oroso- Galiza.jpg|thumb|right|String of garlic]]

Domestically, garlic is stored warm [above 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F)] and dry to keep it dormant (to inhibit sprouting). It is traditionally hung; softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or [[:fr:wikt:grappe|''grappes'']]. Peeled cloves may be stored in [[wine]] or [[vinegar]] in the refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/7231.pdf|title=Garlic: Safe Methods to Store, Preserve, and Enjoy|last=Harris|first=Linda J.|publisher=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially, garlic is stored at 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F), in a dry, low-[[humidity]] environment. Garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFNA&quot;/&gt;

Garlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;umaine&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://extension.umaine.edu/publications/4385e/ |title=Safe Homemade Flavored and Infused Oils |series=Food Safety Facts |publisher=Cooperative Extension Publications, University of Maine |location=Orono, ME |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=umaine/&gt; Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage.&lt;ref name=umaine/&gt; Garlic is also dried at low temperatures, to preserve the enzymatic activity and sold and kept as garlic granules, and can be rehydrated to reactivate it.&lt;ref&gt;The Science of Garlic and How to Make the Best Garlic Bread | Garlic Bread | What's Eating Dan?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse effects and toxicology===
Garlic is known to cause bad breath ([[halitosis]]) and body odor, described as a pungent &quot;garlicky&quot; smell to sweat.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt; This is caused by [[allyl methyl sulfide]] (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt; (and from there to the mouth, causing bad breath; see [[garlic breath]]) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;milk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11138979|title=Drinking a glass of milk can stop garlic breath|date=August 31, 2010|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;milk&quot;/&gt; Plain water, mushrooms, and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;milk&quot;/&gt;

The green, dry &quot;folds&quot; in the center of the garlic clove are especially [[pungency|pungent]]. The [[sulfur]] compound [[allicin]], produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic,&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt; produces other sulfur compounds: [[ajoene]], allyl polysulfides, and [[vinyldithiin]]s.&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt; Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine.

Some people suffer from [[garlic allergy|allergies]] to garlic and other species of ''[[Allium]]''.&lt;ref name=Block2010/&gt; Symptoms can include [[irritable bowel]], [[diarrhea]], mouth and throat ulcerations, [[nausea]], breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt; Garlic-sensitive people show positive tests to [[diallyl disulfide]], allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan, and allicin, all of which are present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including [[onion]]s, [[chives]], [[leek]]s, [[shallot]]s, garden lilies, [[ginger]], and [[banana]]s.

In the typical serving size of 1–3 cloves (3–9 grams), garlic provides no significant nutritional value, with the content of all [[essential nutrients]] below 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table).&lt;ref name=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2446/2|title=Nutrition facts for raw garlic, USDA National Nutrient Database, version SR-21|date=2014|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expressed per 100 grams, garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% or more of the DV), including vitamins [[vitamin B6|B6]] and [[vitamin C|C]], and the [[dietary mineral]]s [[manganese]] and [[phosphorus]]. Per 100 gram serving, garlic is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of certain B vitamins, including [[thiamin]] and [[pantothenic acid]], as well as the dietary minerals [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] (table).

The composition of raw garlic is 59% water, 33% [[carbohydrates]], 6% [[protein]], 2% [[dietary fiber]], and less than 1% [[fat]].&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;

In [[architecture]], and specifically in [[Gothic architecture]], a '''gargoyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑr|ɡ|ɔɪ|l}}) is a carved or formed [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 1997&quot; /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down [[masonry]] walls and eroding the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[flying buttress]]es were used, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wonderopolis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Gargoyle? |url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/what-is-a-gargoyle |website=Wonderopolis |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term originates from the [[French language|French]] ''gargouille,'' which in English is likely to mean &quot;throat&quot; or is otherwise known as the &quot;gullet&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargreaves 1990 p. 51&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; /&gt; cf. [[Latin]] ''gurgulio, gula, gargula'' (&quot;gullet&quot; or &quot;throat&quot;) and similar words derived from the root ''gar,'' &quot;to swallow&quot;, which represented the gurgling sound of water (e.g., [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''garganta,'' &quot;throat&quot;; ''gárgola,'' &quot;gargoyle&quot;). It is also connected to the French verb ''gargariser,'' which shares a Latin root with the verb &quot;gargle&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 1997&quot; /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; /&gt; and is likely imitative in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster 2015&quot; /&gt; The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for gargoyle is ''doccione'' or ''gronda sporgente,''  an architecturally precise phrase which means &quot;protruding gutter&quot;. (Italian also uses ''gargolla'' o ''garguglia'', when it has a grotesque shape)

When not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the correct term for such a sculpture is a [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]], chimera, or [[Boss (architecture)|boss]]. There are also regional variations, such as the [[hunky punk]]. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to protect what they guard, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.

== Legend of the Gargouille ==
{{main|Gargoyle (monster)}}
A French legend that sprang up around the name of [[Romanus of Rouen|St. Romanus]] ({{lang-fr|Romain}}; [[floruit|fl.]] {{Circa|631–641 AD}}), the former chancellor of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Clotaire II]] who was made [[bishop of Rouen]], relates how he delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called ''Gargouille'' or ''Goji''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler Thurston Attwater 1956 p. 183&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbermann Pace Pallen Shahan 1913 p. 209&quot; /&gt;  La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth.  Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or he captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cipa 2009&quot; /&gt; In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the [[reliquary]] of the saint was carried in procession (see details at [[Rouen]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodder 1881 p. 46&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;British Archaeological Association 1939 p. 361&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
The term ''gargoyle'' is most often applied to [[medieval]] work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In [[ancient Egypt]]ian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke Engelbach 1930&quot; /&gt; Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on [[Greek temple]]s, carved or modelled in the [[marble sculpture|marble]] or [[terracotta]] [[cymatium]] of the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinsmoor Anderson 1950&quot; /&gt; An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]].  Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willemsen 1959&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swaddling 1980&quot; /&gt;

Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fudgé 2016 p. 91&quot; /&gt; According to French architect and author [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hourihane 2012 p. 642&quot; /&gt; the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on [[Laon Cathedral]] (c. 1200–1220).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinstock 2016 p. 248&quot; /&gt; One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.

Both ornamented and unornamented waterspouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the [[Rain gutter|guttering]] roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed.  This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. In 1724, the London Building Act passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] made the use of downpipes compulsory in all new construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holy Horrors&quot; /&gt;

== Catholic Church ==
The primary use of the gargoyle was to illustrate [[evil]] through the form of the gargoyle,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} while another theory posits that grotesques in architecture were [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72&quot; /&gt; Sometimes the use of the gargoyles illustrated [[pagan]] beliefs to reflect the unique cultural history of the community the cathedral is  part of. In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rain spouts, [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of his monastery's cloister:&lt;ref name=&quot;Di Renzo 1995 p. 1&quot; /&gt;

{{quotation|What are these fantastic monsters doing in the cloisters before the eyes of the brothers as they read? What is the meaning of these unclean monkeys, these strange savage lions, and monsters? To what purpose are here placed these creatures, half beast, half man, or these spotted tigers? I see several bodies with one head and several heads with one body. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's head, there a fish with a quadruped's head, then again an animal half horse, half goat... Surely if we do not blush for such absurdities, we should at least regret what we have spent on them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leclercq 1963&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nathan 1961 p. 74&quot; /&gt;
}}
According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in ''Gargoylaes, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture'', &quot;There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bridaham 1930 p. xii&quot; /&gt;{{Clear}}

== Animal ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used animal-shaped waterspouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 1997&quot; /&gt;{{rp|11}} During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people.  Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas.  Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France.  In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varner 2008&quot; /&gt;

Human qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals—that is, the animals were [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]]. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[hippopotamus]]) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at [[Laon Cathedral]]) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in Medieval times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton 1997&quot; /&gt;{{rp|20}}

The '''Leaning Tower of Pisa''' ({{lang-it|torre pendente di Pisa}}) or simply the '''Tower of Pisa''' (''torre di Pisa'' {{IPA-it|ˈtorre di ˈpiːsa|}}) is the ''[[bell tower|campanile]]'', or freestanding bell tower, of the [[Cathedral|cathedral]] of the Italian city of [[pisa|Pisa]], known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]. The tower is situated behind the [[Pisa Cathedral]] and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (''[[Piazza dei Miracoli|Piazza del Duomo]]''), after the cathedral and the [[Pisa Baptistery|Pisa Baptistry]].

The height of the tower is {{convert|55.86|m|2|abbr=off}} from the ground on the low side and {{convert|56.67|m|2|abbr=off}} on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is {{convert|2.44|m|2|abbr=on}}. Its weight is estimated at {{Convert|14500|metric ton|short ton|lk=on|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towerofpisa.info/Tower-of-Pisa-facts.html|title=Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts|publisher=Leaning Tower of Pisa|access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase.

The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/793432.stm|title=Europe &amp;#124; Saving the Leaning Tower|date=15 December 2001|work=BBC News|access-date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archidose.org/Jul00/071000.html|title=Tower of Pisa|date=17 June 2001|publisher=Archidose.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626231030/http://www.archidose.org/Jul00/071000.html|archive-date=26 June 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/333926/Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa|title=Leaning Tower of Pisa (tower, Pisa, Italy) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|access-date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaning tower of Pisa loses crooked crown |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/leaning-tower-of-pisa-loses-crooked-crown-1.980085 |access-date=10 June 2020 |work=Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architect ==
There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and [[Bonanno Pisano]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endex.com/gf/buildings/ltpisa/ltpinfo/pisano.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813230458/http://endex.com/gf/buildings/ltpisa/ltpinfo/pisano.htm|title=Endex.com|archive-date=13 August 2007|website=www.endex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his [[bronze casting]], particularly in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Pisa Duomo]]. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for [[Monreale]], Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate [[Diotisalvi]] was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of [[San Nicola, Pisa|San Nicola]] and the [[Baptistery]], both in Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;Pierotti, Piero. (2001). ''Deotisalvi – L'architetto pisano del secolo d'oro.'' Pisa: Pacini Editore&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2020}}

== Construction ==
Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty [[Soldo|soldi]] to the {{Lang|la|Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie}}. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.&lt;ref&gt;Capitular Record Offices of Pisa, parchment n. 248&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37PStsDpevoC&amp;pg=PA254 |title=Finite Element Analysis in Geotechnical Engineering: Application |last1=Potts |first1=David M. |last2=Zdravkovic |first2=Lidija |last3=Zdravković |first3=Lidija |date=2001 |publisher=Thomas Telford |isbn=9780727727831 |pages=254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a [[blind arcade]] articulated by engaged columns with classical [[Corinthian capitals]].{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} Nearly four centuries later [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote: &quot;Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/leoperedigiorgio08vasa |title=Le opere di Giorgio Vasari: Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori |last=Vasari |first=Giorgio |date=1878 |publisher=G.C.

The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable [[subsoil]], a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the [[Republic of Pisa]] was almost continually engaged in battles with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Lucca|Lucca]], and [[Florence]]. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs-nova&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Fall of the Leaning Tower – History of Interventions |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pisa/interventions.html |website=NOVA Online (PBS) |access-date=24 April 2019 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Offices of Pisa, Opera della Primaziale, 27 December 1234&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of [[Giovanni Pisano]], was elected to oversee the building of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Offices of Pisa, Opera della Primaziale, 23 February 1260&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 1264, the master builder [[Giovanni di Simone]], architect of the [[Camposanto Monumentale di Pisa|Camposanto]], and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Offices of Pisa, Roncioni, 12 April 1265.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclain&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=McLain |first=Bill |title=Do Fish Drink Water? |year=1999 |isbn=0-688-16512-5 |publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dofishdrinkwater00mcla_0/page/291 291–292] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dofishdrinkwater00mcla_0/page/291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gu9Ev_4PL5oC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Authentic Tuscany |last=Touring club italiano |date=2005 |publisher=Touring Editore |isbn=9788836532971 |pages=64 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh floor was completed in 1319.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_5QDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 |title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, and Meaning |last=Roth |first=Leland M. |date=13 March 2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780429975219 |pages=98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by [[Tommaso di Andrea Pisano]], who succeeded in harmonizing the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] elements of the belfry with the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;

The largest one was installed in 1655.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs-nova&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- * One possible known builder of Pisa Tower was [[Gerardo di Gerardo]]. His name appears as a witness to the above legacy of Berta di Bernardo as &quot;Master Gerardo&quot;, and as a worker whose name was Gerardo.
* A more probable builder was Diotisalvi, because of the construction period and the structure's affinities with other buildings in Pisa, but he usually signed his works, and there is no signature by him in the bell tower.
* Giovanni di Simone was known to be heavily involved in the completion of the tower, under the direction of Giovanni Pisano, who at the time was master builder of the [[Opera di Santa Maria Maggiore]]. --&gt;

Between 1589 and 1592,&lt;ref&gt;Some contemporary sources speculate about the exact date; e.g. Rachel Hilliam gives 1591 (''Galileo Galilei: Father of Modern Science'', The Rosen Publishing Group, 2005, p. 101).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]], who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped two cannonballs]] of different [[mass]]es from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass, in keeping with the [[law of free fall]]. The primary source for this is the biography ''Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei)'', written by Galileo's pupil and secretary [[Vincenzo Viviani]] in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/06/30/stories/2005063000351500.htm |title=Sci Tech : Science history: setting the record straight |newspaper=The Hindu |date=30 June 2005 |access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/VincenzoViviani.html Vincenzo Viviani] on museo galileo&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. Leon Weckstein, a [[U.S. Army]] [[sergeant]] sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower, was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an [[artillery]] strike, sparing it from destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;tilt&quot;&gt;Shrady, Nicholas (2003): ''Tilt: a skewed history of the Tower of Pisa''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jan/13/features11.g23 |title=Why I spared the Leaning Tower of Pisa |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 January 2000 |access-date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE153EF932A35752C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |title=Securing the Lean In Tower of Pisa |date=1 November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multinational [[task force]] of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the [[Azores]] islands to discuss stabilisation methods.{{when|date=July 2019}} It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base as a temporary intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000167,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] |title=Tipping the Balance |date=25 June 2001 |access-date=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower and the neighbouring [[cathedral]], [[baptistery]], and cemetery are included in the [[Piazza del Duomo, Pisa|Piazza del Duomo]] [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], which was declared in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Piazza del Duomo, Pisa |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/395 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] World Heritage Centre|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990,&lt;ref name=closed1990&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/7/newsid_4037000/4037997.stm |title=BBC on this day: 1990: Leaning Tower of Pisa closed to public |work=BBC News |access-date=29 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the [[Civic Tower (Pavia)|Civic Tower of Pavia]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1989&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Hofman | first=Paul |date=30 July 1989 |title=Italy's Endangered Treasures |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/30/travel/italy-s-endangered-treasures.html |work=[[New York Times]] |location=New York |access-date=29 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1989&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Montalbo | first=William D |date=18 March 1989 |title=900-Year-Old Bell Tower Collapses in Italy; Three Killed |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-03-18-mn-119-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=Los Angeles |access-date=29 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bells were removed to relieve some weight, and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal {{convert|38|m3|0|abbr=off}} from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by {{convert|45|cm|1|abbr=off}}, returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-2001&quot; /&gt; In total, {{convert|70|metric ton|short ton}} of soil were removed.&lt;ref name=stabilized&gt;{{cite news |last=Duff |first=Mark |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7423957.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Pisa's leaning tower 'stabilised' |work=BBC News |date=28 May 2008 |access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.&lt;ref name=stabilized /&gt;

== Surviving earthquakes ==
At least four strong [[earthquake]]s hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic [[soil-structure interaction]] (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower, together with the softness of the foundation soil, influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not [[Mechanical resonance#Resonance disaster|resonate]] with [[Strong ground motion|earthquake ground motion]]. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180509105004.htm |title=500-year-old Leaning Tower of Pisa mystery unveiled by engineers |website=ScienceDaily |date=9 May 2018 |access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the 5th bell: The name ''Pasquareccia'' comes from ''Easter'', because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in ''Palazzo Pretorio'' in Pisa, where it was called ''La Giustizia'' (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including [[Ugolino della Gherardesca|Count Ugolino]] in 1289.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ugolino&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luccaturismo.com/umutesiadd.asp?id=56 |title=Torre pendente |access-date=19 March 2008 |publisher=Lucca turismo |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken ''Pasquareccia''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

{{Short description|Radio signal transmission method}}
{{Modulation techniques}}
{{Multiplex techniques}}
'''Frequency-hopping spread spectrum''' ('''FHSS''') is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly changing the carrier frequency among many distinct frequencies occupying a large spectral band. The changes are controlled by a code known to both [[transmitter]] and [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]. FHSS is used to avoid interference, to prevent eavesdropping, and to enable [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) communications.

The available frequency band is divided into smaller sub-bands. Signals rapidly change (&quot;hop&quot;) their carrier frequencies among the center frequencies of these sub-bands in a predetermined order. Interference at a specific frequency will only affect the signal during a short interval.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Principles of Spread-Spectrum Communication Systems, 4th ed.| year=2018|last1=Torrieri|first1=Don}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FHSS offers three main advantages over a fixed-frequency transmission:

# FHSS signals are highly resistant to [[narrowband]] [[Interference (communication)|interference]] because the signal hops to a different frequency band. 
# Signals are difficult to intercept if the frequency-hopping pattern is not known.
##Jamming is also difficult if the pattern is unknown; a malicious individual may only jam the signal for a single hopping period if the spreading sequence is unknown.
# FHSS transmissions can share a frequency band with many types of conventional transmissions with minimal mutual interference. FHSS signals add minimal interference to narrowband communications, and vice versa.

==Military use==
Spread-spectrum signals are highly resistant to deliberate [[radio jamming|jamming]], unless the adversary has knowledge of the frequency-hopping pattern. Military radios generate the frequency-hopping pattern under the control of a secret [[TRANSEC|Transmission Security Key]] (TRANSEC) that the sender and receiver share in advance. This key is generated by devices such as the [[KY-57]] Speech Security Equipment. United States military radios that use frequency hopping include the JTIDS/MIDS family, the [[HAVE QUICK]] Aeronautical Mobile communications system, and the [[SINCGARS]] Combat Net Radio, [[Link-16]].

==Civilian use==
In the US, since the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) amended rules to allow FHSS systems in the unregulated 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, many consumer devices in that band have employed various FHSS modes. eFCC CFR 47 part 15.247 covers the regulations in the US for  902–928&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2400–2483.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 5725–5850&amp;nbsp;MHz bands, and the requirements for frequency hopping &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=47 CFR § 15.247 - Operation within the bands 902–928 MHz, 2400–2483.5 MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz. |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/15.247 |website=LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=law.cornell.edu |accessdate=17 December 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[walkie-talkies]] that employ FHSS technology have been developed for unlicensed use on the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band. FHSS technology is also used in many hobby radio-controlled transmitters and receivers used for model cars, airplanes, and drones. A type of multiple access is achieved allowing hundreds of transmitter/receiver pairs to be operated simultaneously on the same band in contrast to previous FM or AM radio-controlled systems that had limited simultaneous channels.

==Technical considerations==
The overall bandwidth required for frequency hopping is much wider than that required to transmit the same information using only one [[carrier frequency]]. However, because transmission occurs only on a small portion of this bandwidth at any given time, the instantaneous interference bandwidth is really the same. While providing no extra protection against wideband [[thermal noise]], the frequency-hopping approach reduces the degradation caused by narrowband interference sources.

One of the challenges of frequency-hopping systems is to synchronize the transmitter and receiver. One approach is to have a guarantee that the transmitter will use all the channels in a fixed period of time. The receiver can then find the transmitter by picking a random channel and listening for valid data on that channel. The transmitter's data is identified by a special sequence of data that is unlikely to occur over the segment of data for this channel, and the segment can also have a [[checksum]] for integrity checking and further identification. The transmitter and receiver can use fixed tables of frequency-hopping patterns, so that once synchronized they can maintain communication by following the table.

In the US, [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC part 15]] on unlicensed spread spectrum systems in the 902–928&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz bands permits more power than is allowed for non-spread-spectrum systems. Both FHSS and direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) systems can transmit at 1 watt, a thousand-fold increase from the 1 milliwatt limit on non-spread-spectrum systems. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) also prescribes a minimum number of frequency channels and a maximum dwell time for each channel.

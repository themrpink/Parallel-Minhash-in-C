* Typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities of about 85 to 95&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 0.5–4%.
* Sound reinforcement and public address loudspeakers have sensitivities of perhaps 95 to 102&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 4–10%.
* Rock concert, stadium PA, marine hailing, etc. speakers generally have higher sensitivities of 103 to 110&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 10–20%.

A driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3&amp;nbsp;dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3&amp;nbsp;dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100&amp;nbsp;W driver (&quot;A&quot;) rated at 92&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200&amp;nbsp;W driver (&quot;B&quot;) rated at 89&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m when both are driven with 100&amp;nbsp;W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100&amp;nbsp;W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or [[loudness]] as speaker B would produce with 200&amp;nbsp;W input. Thus, a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.

The interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from [[resonant room modes]]), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.

A significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.

===Placement===
In a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary [[acoustic resonance]] nodes in each of the three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acoustics&quot;, Leo Beranek, chapter 10, McGraw Hill Books, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create [[standing wave]]s. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the [[Schroeder frequency]]&amp;nbsp;– typically around 200–300&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on room size.

===Directivity===
Acousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.

Any object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.

One simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.

In real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. A mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion. As a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following:
the formula for far field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(\theta) = \frac{p_0 J_1(k_a \sin \theta)}{k_a \sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
where &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;k_a=\frac{2\pi a}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the pressure on axis, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the piston radius, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the wavelength (i.e. &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{\text{speed of sound}}{\text{frequency}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the angle off axis and &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.

A planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.

Various manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called [[studio monitor|monitors]], as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in [[Bose Corporation#Criticisms|high fidelity circles]], but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.

Directivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., &quot;flat&quot; across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.

==Other speaker designs==

While dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.

===With a diaphragm===

====Moving-iron loudspeakers====
{{main article|Moving iron speaker}}
[[image:Moving-iron_cone_speaker_1929.png|thumb|right|200px|Moving iron speaker]]
The moving iron speaker was the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature).  The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself.  This design was the original loudspeaker design, dating back to the early telephone.  Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound.  They require large magnets and coils to increase force.&lt;ref name=&quot;moving iron&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moving-Iron Speaker|url=http://www.vias.org/crowhurstba/crowhurst_basic_audio_vol1_042.html|website=vias.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board.  Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances.  They are still used today for high-end [[earphones]] and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.&lt;ref name=&quot;balanced armature&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hertsens|first1=Tyll|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|url=http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work#IboPCt5E0YtmLTAL.97|website=innerfidelity|date=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piezoelectric speakers====
{{main article|Piezoelectric speaker}}
{{See also|Piezo tweeter}}
[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|A piezoelectric buzzer. The white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed to a metal diaphragm.]]
Piezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in [[watch]]es and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they are resistant to overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, and they can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.

Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, [[sonar]] applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of [[underwater microphone]]s). They have advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone based device would.

In 2013, [[Kyocera]] introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only 1 millimeter of thickness and 7 grams of weight for their 55&quot; [[OLED]] televisions and they hope the speakers will also be used in PCs and tablets. Besides medium-size, there are also large and small sizes which can all produce relatively the same quality of sound and volume within 180 degrees. The highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional TV speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/kyocera-piezoelectric-film-speaker/#continued |title=Kyocera piezoelectric film speaker delivers 180-degree sound to thin TVs and tablets (update: live photos) |date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Magnetostatic loudspeaker}}
[[File:Magnepan MG1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Magnetostatic loudspeaker]]
Instead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it.  Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.

====Magnetostrictive speakers====
Magnetostrictive transducers, based on [[magnetostriction]], have been predominantly used as [[sonar]] ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Takeyoshi |last=Yamada |title=Fostex Prototypes Tabletop Vibration Speaker System Using Super Magnetostrictor |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20051117/110823/ |publisher=Tech-On! |date=November 2005 |access-date=2009-10-05 |quote=The cone-shaped speaker system is 95 mm in diameter and 90 mm high.

====Electrostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Electrostatic loudspeaker}}
[[Image:Es spk.gif|frame|right|170px|Schematic showing an electrostatic speaker's construction and its connections. The thickness of the diaphragm and grids has been exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.]]
[[Electrostatic loudspeaker]]s use a high voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) to drive a thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning.  However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers.  They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency.  This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.

Electrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass [[roll-off|rolls off]] at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.

Electrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier.  This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency.  A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.

====Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers====
A '''ribbon speaker''' consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little [[mass]]; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile—some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier &quot;sees&quot; a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.

Planar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The [[Laplace force|current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field]] of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.

====Bending wave loudspeakers====
Bending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80&amp;nbsp;Hz to 35,000&amp;nbsp;Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/687ohm/ Stereophile magazine. ''Ohm Walsh 5 loudspeaker'' (review by Dick Olsher, June 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt; This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.

The Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by [[Lincoln Walsh]], who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a &quot;transmission line&quot;. The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then.  German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.

The German firm, Manger, has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full range sound.&lt;ref&gt;Manger, Josef W. [http://issuu.com/manger-msw/docs/acoustical_reality-1-?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage &quot;Acoustical Reality&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Josef W. Manger was awarded with the &quot;Diesel Medal&quot; for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.

====Flat panel loudspeakers====
There have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of &quot;exciter&quot; transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_pmDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=There+have+been+many+attempts+to+reduce+the+size+of+speaker+systems%2C+or+alternatively+to+make+them+less+obvious.+One+such+attempt+was+the+development+of+%22exciter%22+transducer+coils+mounted+to+flat+panels+to+act+as+sound+sources%2C+most+accurately+called+exciter%2Fpanel+drivers&amp;pg=PA86|title=Computational Science/Intelligence &amp; Applied Informatics|date=2018-07-31|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-96806-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as [[Styrofoam]], and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|title=Abuzhen Mini Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker|website=www.desireeasy.com|access-date=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206102224/https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|archive-date=6 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heil air motion transducers====
{{Main article|Air Motion Transformer}}
[[Image:AirMotionTransformer.png|right|thumb|300px|In Heil's air motion transducer, current through the membrane 2 causes it to move left and right in magnetic field 6, moving air in and out along directions 8; barriers 4 prevent air from moving in unintended directions.]]
[[Oskar Heil]] invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Lafayette Radio]], a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany—one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.

====Transparent ionic conduction speaker====
In 2013, a research team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and adaptive optics fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/30/transparent-gel-speaker-ionic-conduction/#continued |title=Transparent gel speaker plays music through the magic of ionic conduction (video) |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma arc speakers====
{{Main article|Plasma speaker}}
[[File:Moeller Plasma.jpg|thumb|Plasma speaker]]
[[Plasma arc loudspeaker]]s use electrical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but is charged and therefore can be manipulated by an [[electric field]], the result is a very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the [[Plasmatronics]] Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from [[helium]] gas.&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi&gt;[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described. Retrieved March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoided the [[ozone]] and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi/&gt; produced by [[Radio frequency|RF]] decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.

A less expensive variation on this theme is the use of a flame for the driver, as flames contain ionized (electrically charged) gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/feb98/888372043.Ot.r.html|title=Re: COULD YOU PLEASE FIND RESEARCH RE:SOUND REPRODUTION VIA GAS FLAME &amp; ELECTRI|website=www.madsci.org|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermoacoustic speakers====
In 2008, researchers of Tsinghua University demonstrated a thermoacoustic loudspeaker of [[carbon nanotube]] thin film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Lin|author2=Kaili Jiang |title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|year=2008|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539–4545|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976|bibcode=2008NanoL...8.4539X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose working mechanism is a thermoacoustic effect. Sound frequency electric currents are used to periodically heat the CNT and thus result in sound generation in the surrounding air. The CNT thin film loudspeaker is transparent, stretchable and flexible.
In 2013, researchers of Tsinghua University further present a thermoacoustic earphone of carbon nanotube thin yarn and a thermoacoustic surface-mounted device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yang|author2=Xiaoyang Lin |title=Thermoacoustic Chips with Carbon Nanotube Thin Yarn Arrays|journal=Nano Letters|year=2013|doi=10.1021/nl402408j|pmid=24041369|volume=13|issue=10|pages=4795–801|bibcode=2013NanoL..13.4795W}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both fully integrated devices and compatible with Si-based semiconducting technology.

====Rotary woofers====

A [[rotary woofer]] is essentially a fan with blades that constantly change their pitch, allowing them to easily push the air back and forth.  Rotary woofers are able to efficiently reproduce [[infrasound]] frequencies, which are difficult to impossible to achieve on a traditional speaker with a diaphragm.  They are often employed in movie theaters to recreate rumbling bass effects, such as explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iar-80.com/page142.html|title=Eminent Technology TRW-17 Subwoofer Part I: The Only Subwoofer|website=International Audio/Video Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guttenberg|first1=Steve|title=World's most amazing subwoofer has no woofer|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-most-amazing-subwoofer-has-no-woofer/|website=Cnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digital speakers====
{{Main article|Digital speaker}}

[[Digital speakers]] have been the subject of experiments performed by [[Bell Labs]] as far back as the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The design is simple; each [[bit]] controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent [[analog-to-digital conversion]] problems, the effect of [[aliasing]] is unavoidable, so that the audio output is &quot;reflected&quot; at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the [[Nyquist limit]] (half the sampling frequency), causing an unacceptably high level of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]s to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.

The term &quot;digital&quot; or &quot;digital-ready&quot; is often used for marketing purposes on speakers or [[headphones]], but these systems are not digital in the sense described above. Rather, they are conventional speakers that can be used with digital sound sources (e.g., [[optical media]], [[MP3]] players, etc.), as can any conventional speaker.

The '''Obotrites''' ({{lang-la|Obotriti}}, ''Abodritorum,Abodritos…'') or '''Obodrites''', also spelled '''Abodrites''' ({{lang-de|Abodriten}}), were a confederation of medieval [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribes within the territory of modern [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Holstein]] in northern [[Germany]] (see [[Polabian Slavs]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;crusade-en&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Jensen | first = Carsten Selch | title = Abodrites | editor = Alan V. Murray | encyclopedia = The Crusades: An Encyclopedia | volume = 1 | pages = 3 | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | location = [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] | year = 2006 | url = http://lukashevichus.info/knigi/murray_crusades_encycl.pdf | oclc = 70122512}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, they were allies of [[Charlemagne]] in his wars against the Germanic [[Saxons]] and the Slavic [[Veleti]]. The Obotrites under Prince [[Thrasco (Obotrite prince)|Thrasco]] defeated the [[Saxons]] in the [[Battle of Bornhöved (798)]]. The still heathen Saxons were dispersed by the emperor, and the part of their former land in [[Holstein]] north of [[Elbe]] was awarded to the Obotrites in 804, as a reward for their victory. This however was soon reverted through an invasion of the [[Danes]]. The Obotrite regnal style was abolished in 1167, when [[Pribislav of Mecklenburg|Pribislav]] was restored to power by Duke [[Henry the Lion]], as Prince of Mecklenburg, thereby founding the German [[House of Mecklenburg]].

==Obotrite confederation==
The [[Bavarian Geographer]], an anonymous medieval document compiled in [[Regensburg]] in 830, contains a list of the tribes in Central Eastern Europe to the east of the Elbe. The list includes the Nortabtrezi (Obotrites) - with 53 ''civitates''.
[[Adam of Bremen]] referred to them as the '''Reregi''' because of their lucrative trade emporium [[Reric]]. In common with other Slavic groups, they were often described by Germanic sources as [[Wends]].
[[File:Billunger Mark 1000.PNG|thumb|left|upright|Map of the Billunger Mark (c. 1000) showing different tribes of the Obotritic confederation]]
The main tribes of the Obotritic confederation were:&lt;ref name=Herrman-7-8&gt;Herrmann 1970, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

*the Obotrites proper ([[Wismar Bay]] to [[Schweriner See|Lake Schwerin]]);
*the [[Wagrians]] (the eastern [[Holstein]] as part of [[Old Saxony|Saxony]]);
*the [[Warnower]] (the upper [[Warnow]] and [[Mildenitz (river)|Mildenitz]]);
*the [[Polabians (tribe)|Polabians proper]] (between the [[Trave]] and the [[Elbe]]).

Other tribes associated with the confederation include:&lt;ref name=Herrman-7-8/&gt;
*the [[Linonen]] near [[Lenzen]],
*the [[Travnjane]] near the [[Trave]],
*the [[Drevani]] in the [[Lüchow-Dannenberg|Hanoverian Wendland]].

==History==
As allies of the [[Carolingian]] kings and the empire of their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] successors, the Obotrites fought from 808 to 1200 against the [[kings of Denmark]], who wished to rule the [[Baltic region]] independently of the empire. When opportunities arose, for instance upon the death of an emperor, they would seek to seize power; and in 983 [[Hamburg]] was destroyed by the Obotrites under their king, [[Mstivoj]]. At times they levied tribute from the [[Danes]] and [[Saxons]]. Under the leadership of [[Niklot]], they resisted a Christian assault during the [[Wendish Crusade]].
[[Image:Limes.saxoniae.wmt.png|thumb|upright=1.0|The ''[[Limes Saxoniae]]'' forming the border between the Saxons to the west and the Obotrites to the east]]
German missionaries such as [[Vicelinus]] converted the Obotrites to [[Christianity]]. In 1170 they acknowledged the suzerainty of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], leading to [[Germanisation]] and assimilation over the following centuries. However, up to the late 15th century most villagers in the Obotritic area were still speaking Slavic dialects ([[Polabian language]]), although subsequently their language was displaced by [[German language|German]]. The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in Hanoverian Wendland, eastern Lower Saxony (bordering modern Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-466672/Polabian-language Polabian language]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ruling clan of the Obotrites kept its power throughout the Germanisation and ruled their country (except during a short interruption in [[Thirty Years' War]]) as [[House of Mecklenburg]] until the end of monarchies in Germany in [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution 1918]].

==Career==

===1990s===

Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992 and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, ''[[The Turning (1992 film)|The Turning]]'', starring [[Karen Allen]] and [[Tess Harper]]. The film drama is an adaptation of the play ''Home Fires Burning''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio1&quot;/&gt;

Although she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: &quot;First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio1&quot;/&gt; She broke into mainstream television in 1993 with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, ''[[Class of '96]]'', on the fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BioYahoo&quot;/&gt;

As a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for ''[[The X-Files]]''. She was 24 when she decided to audition because, &quot;for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Walker|first= Alix|title= People should know that I laugh|url= http://www.stylist.co.uk/from-the-app/gillian-anderson-people-should-know-that-i-laugh|accessdate=September 21, 2015|newspaper= Stylist Magazine|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio1&quot;/&gt; Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as [[Dana Scully|FBI Special Agent Dana Scully]]. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American television networks. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on ''The X-Files'', Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series#1990s|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/gillian-anderson |title=Gillian Anderson Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama#1990s|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series#1990s|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television]].

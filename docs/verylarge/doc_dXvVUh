During the [[Second World War]], Dodge Kew was part of the [[London Aircraft Production Group]], building fuselage sections for [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the [[Dodge 100 &quot;Kew&quot;]] truck (1949–1957), nicknamed the &quot;parrot nose&quot; due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet. Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957–1963) and the 400 series (1963–1965). The 400 series was a version of the American [[Dodge D series|D series]] medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the [[Cab over|cab-over]] [[Dodge 300|300 series]] (1957–1965) and its successor the [[Dodge 500|500 series/K-series]] (1964–1978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British [[Rootes Group]] and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes' factory in Dunstable. British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.

In some export markets British-built Dodge trucks used the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] or [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] marques, and the situation was further complicated after takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]] marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the [[Dodge 100 &quot;Commando&quot;|100 series &quot;Commando&quot;]] light truck (1970–1989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets. In 1976 Chrysler Europe rationalised its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller [[Commer FC|Commer SpaceVan]] (1960–1983) and [[Commer Walk-Thru]] (1961–1979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe's French-built [[Simca 1100]] were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).

American Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from [[Knock-down kit|CKD]] kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926–1958) and Rotterdam (1958–1970), but sales volumes were low as even 'compact' American cars like the [[Dodge Dart]] were enormous [[gas-guzzler]]s by European standards. However, [[protectionist]] policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren|AMAG]] in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948–1972) and [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory's output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the [[Dodge 300]] (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4×2, 6×4, 8×2 and 8×4 rigids, as well as 4×2 semi-trailer tractors.

Following Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to [[Peugeot]], the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to [[Renault Trucks|Renault Véhicules Industriels]]. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets – most notably the United Kingdom. However the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the [[Dodge 50 series]] (1979–1992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.

Dodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.

Chrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro and [[Dodge Journey]] cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a short-lived return due to the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/05/19/dodge-stops-selling-nitro-caliber-in-uk/ |title=Dodge stops selling Nitro, Caliber in UK |publisher=Autoblog |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 1, 2011 it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the [[Fiat Freemont]] (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autofacil.es/problemas-coche/2011/07/11/pasa-tienes-chrysler-o-dodge/7432.html |title=Qué pasa si tienes un Chrysler o Dodge|publisher=Autofácil (Luike) |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the [[Hyundai Accent]], [[Hyundai Atos]], and [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] were branded as &quot;Dodge&quot;, [[Dodge Attitude]], &quot;Verna by Dodge&quot;, &quot;Atos by Dodge&quot; and &quot;Dodge H100&quot; respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers. Current models are marketed with Hyundai logos instead of the &quot;Ram&quot; logo on previous model years since 2014. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge will use rebadged and reworked Fiats (2014). Also, to the next year with [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] is sold as the new Dodge Attitude since 2015.

==Logos==
* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] intertwined representing the letter &quot;[[D]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada/3-dodge.html |title=History of Dodge Brothers |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked &quot;DB&quot; was at the center of the star, and the words &quot;Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles&quot; encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the [[Star of David]], the Dodge brothers were not [[Jewish]]; they were [[Methodist]]s. Although the &quot;Brothers&quot; was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.
* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car's hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram's head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.
* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an &quot;O&quot; in the center. A knight's head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through to 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight's head without the crest would be used for 1959.
* Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting [[space age]] rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.
* Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1962-1964-dodge-8802.htm |title=1962–1964 Dodge 880 article |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sealey |first=Mike |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/logos.html |title=Mike Sealey's history of Chrysler's logos |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering wheel center hubs and road wheel covers.
* Pentastar: From 1982 to 1995, Dodge used Chrysler's [[History of Chrysler#Pentastar|Pentastar]] logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge's Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth's was blue.
* [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]'s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram's head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy duty tractor units. Gradually the ram's head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the [[Bighorn sheep|Ram]]'s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing on that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which uses the [[Viperidae|Viper's]] Head.
* New logo: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, two new Dodge logos were unveiled. The first logo features the word &quot;DODGE&quot; with two red inclined stripes. It was originally used strictly for marketing purposes, however Dodge introduced the logo onto the grilles of the 2012 lineup.

A second emblem was revealed during the unveiling of the 2011 Durango, which used the same five-point shield-shaped outline of the old emblem, but with the ram's head replaced with a chrome cross reminiscent of the brand's signature cross-haired grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/|title=New Dodge emblem revealed |publisher=VehiCast |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112925/http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/ |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was only used on the [[steering wheel]]. In 2014, the cross logo was replaced by the word &quot;DODGE&quot; on the Durango steering wheel. A modified version of the Ram's head logo is still used for the Ram brand, with &quot;RAM&quot; written across the bottom in bold white or black lettering.

{{About|the general concept|Robert A. Heinlein's series of short stories and novels|Future History (Heinlein)}}
{{short description|Postulated history of the future and is used by authors in the subgenre of speculative fiction}}
A '''future history''' is a postulated [[history]] of the [[future]] and is used by authors of [[science fiction]] and other [[speculative fiction]] to construct a common background for fiction. Sometimes the author publishes a [[Chronology|timeline]] of events in the history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information provided therein.

== Background ==
The term appears to have been coined by [[John W. Campbell, Jr.|John W. Campbell,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], the editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', in the February 1941 issue of that magazine, in reference to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History]]''. [[Neil R. Jones]] is generally credited as the first author to create a future history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot;&gt;Ashley, M. (April, 1989). The Immortal Professor, Astro Adventures No.7, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of stories which share a backdrop but are not really concerned with the sequence of history in their universe are rarely considered future histories. For example, neither [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s ''[[Vorkosigan Saga]]'' nor [[George R. R. Martin]]'s 1970s short stories which share a backdrop are generally considered future histories. Standalone stories which trace an arc of history are rarely considered future histories. For example, [[Walter M. Miller Jr.|Walter M. Miller&amp;nbsp;Jr.]]'s ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz|A&amp;nbsp;Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' is not generally considered a future history.{{by whom|date=March 2020|Annisa Riviana=|Fira maghfirah=|Evita=}}

Earlier, some works were published which constituted &quot;future history&quot; in a more literal sense—i.e., stories or whole books purporting to be excerpts of a history book from the future and which are written in the form of a history book—i.e., having no personal protagonists but rather describing the development of nations and societies over decades and centuries.

Such works include:

* [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Unparalleled Invasion]]'' (1914) describing a devastating war between an alliance of Western nations and China in 1975, ending with a complete [[genocide]] of the Chinese. It is described in a short footnote as &quot;Excerpt from Walt Mervin's 'Certain Essays in History'{{-&quot;}}.
* [[André Maurois]]'s ''[[The War against the Moon]]'' (1928), where a band of well-meaning conspirators intend to avert a devastating [[world war]] by uniting humanity in hatred of a fictitious [[moon|Lunar]] enemy  only to find that the moon is truly inhabited and that they had unwittingly set off the first [[interplanetary war]]. This, too, is explicitly described as an excerpt from a future history book.
* The most ambitious of this subgenre is [[H.G. Wells|H. G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]]' ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933), written in the form of a history book published in the year 2106 and—in the manner of a real history book—containing numerous footnotes and references to the works of (mostly fictitious) prominent historians of the 20th and 21st centuries.

== Alternate history ==
Unlike [[alternate history]], where alternative outcomes are ascribed to past events, future history postulates certain outcomes to events in the writer's present and future.

The essential difference is that the writer of alternate history is in possession of knowledge of the actual outcome of a certain event, and that knowledge influences also the description of the event's alternate outcome. The writer of future history does not have such knowledge, such works being based on speculations and predictions current at the time of writing—which often turn out to be wildly inaccurate.

For example, in 1933 [[H. G. Wells]] postulated in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' a [[Second World War]] in which [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Poland]] are evenly matched militarily, fighting an indecisive war over ten years; and Poul Anderson's early 1950s [[The Psychotechnic League|Psychotechnic League]] depicted a world undergoing a devastating [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] in 1958, yet by the early 21st century managing not only to rebuild the ruins on Earth but also engage in extensive space colonization of the Moon and several planets. A writer possessing knowledge of the actual swift collapse of Poland in World War II and the enormous actual costs of far less ambitious space programs in a far less devastated world would have been unlikely to postulate such outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Vernon, &quot;Reasoned and unreasoned speculations about what will be and what might have been&quot; in Marcia Gracie (ed.) &quot;Trends in Speculative Fiction&quot;, New York, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' was set in the future and featured developments in space travel and habitation  which have not occurred on the timescale postulated.

A problem with future history science fiction is that it will date and be overtaken by real historical events, for instance H. Beam Piper's future history, which included a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] in 1973, and much of the future history of ''[[Star Trek]]''. [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s &quot;[[CoDominium]]&quot; future history assumed that the [[Cold War]] would end with the United States and Soviet Union establishing a co-rule of the world, the CoDominium of the title, which would last into the 22nd Century—rather than the Soviet Union collapsing in 1991.

There are several ways this is dealt with. One solution to the problem is when some authors set their stories in an indefinite future, often in a society where the current calendar has been disrupted due to a [[societal collapse]] or undergone some form of distortion due to the impact of technology. Related to the first, some stories are set in the very remote future and only deal with the author's contemporary history in a sketchy fashion, if at all (e.g. the original ''Foundation'' Trilogy by Asimov). Another related case is where stories are set in the near future, but with an explicitly allohistorical past, as in [[Ken MacLeod]]'s ''[[The Engines of Light Trilogy|Engines of Light]]'' series.

In other cases, the merging of the fictional history and the known history is done through extensive use of [[retroactive continuity]]. In yet other cases, such as the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' television series and the fiction based on it, much use is made of [[secret history]], in which the events that take place are largely secret and not known to the general public.

As with Heinlein, some authors simply write a detailed future history and accept the fact that events will overtake it, making the sequence into a ''[[de facto]]'' [[alternate history]].

Lastly, some writers formally transform their future histories into [[alternate history]], once they had been overtaken by events. For example, Poul Anderson started The Psychotechnic League history in the early 1950s, assuming a nuclear war in 1958—then a future date. When it was republished in the 1980s, a new foreword was added explaining how that history's timeline diverged from ours and led to war.

'''''The Dukes of Hazzard''''' is an American [[Action (fiction)|action]]-[[comedy]] television series that was aired on [[CBS]] from January 26, 1979, to February 8, 1985. The show aired for 147 episodes spanning seven seasons. It was consistently among the top-rated television series in the late 1970s (at one point, ranking second only to ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which immediately followed the show on CBS's Friday night schedule). The show is about two young male cousins, Bo and Luke Duke, who live in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and are on [[probation]] for [[moonshine]]-running. The young men and their friends and their female cousin [[Daisy Duke]], and other family (such as patriarch Uncle Jesse), have various escapades as they evade the corrupt law officers [[Boss Hogg]] and [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]]. The young men drive a customized 1969 [[Dodge Charger]] nicknamed ''[[General Lee (car)|(The) General Lee]]'', which became an iconic symbol of the show.

The series was inspired by the 1975 film ''[[Moonrunners]]'', about a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] family which was also created by [[Gy Waldron]] and had many identical or similar character names and concepts. The show was the basis for a [[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|film of the same title]] in 2005.

==Plot overview==
''The Dukes of Hazzard'' follows the adventures of &quot;the Duke boys&quot;, cousins [[Bo Duke]] ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]) and [[Luke Duke]] ([[Tom Wopat]]) (including Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in [[List of fictional counties|fictional]] Hazzard County, Georgia (the exact location of which was never specified, though Atlanta was mentioned several times as the nearest big city), with their female cousin [[Daisy Duke|Daisy]] ([[Catherine Bach]]) and their wise old [[#Jesse|Uncle Jesse]] ([[Denver Pyle]]). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 [[Dodge Charger]] [[Stock car racing|stock car]], dubbed ''[[General Lee (car)|(The) General Lee]]'', evading crooked and corrupt [[county commission]]er [[Boss Hogg]] ([[Sorrell Booke]]) and his bumbling and corrupt [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]] ([[James Best]]) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of various local escapades and incidents.

Bo and Luke were previously sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of [[moonshine]]; their Uncle Jesse made a [[plea bargain]] with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on five years' probation and not allowed to carry firearms—instead, they often use [[compound bow]]s, sometimes with arrows tipped with [[dynamite]]—or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg. The exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also come into play at various times.

Corrupt county commissioner Jefferson Davis (J. D.) &quot;Boss&quot; Hogg, who either runs, or has his fingers in, virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever angry with the Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, and looking for ways to get them out of the picture, for their habit of foiling his [[illegal scheme|crooked schemes]]. Many episodes revolve around Hogg's attempts to engage in some such scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help.

Some of these are [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and he often tries to frame Bo and Luke as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg never loses his irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other nefarious actions.

The role of Boss Hogg was played by [[Sorrell Booke]], who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film prior to his role in ''The Dukes of Hazzard''. Boss Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the TV series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke.

The other main characters of the show include local mechanic [[#Cooter|Cooter Davenport]] ([[Ben Jones (Georgia congressman)|Ben Jones]]), who in early episodes was portrayed as a wild, unshaven rebel, often breaking or treading on the edge of the law, before settling down to become the Duke family's best friend (he is often referred to as an &quot;honorary Duke&quot;) and owning the local garage. [[#Enos|Enos Strate]] ([[Sonny Shroyer]]) is an honest but naive young [[Deputy sheriff|deputy]] who, despite his friendship with the Dukes (and his crush on Daisy), is reluctantly forced to take part in Hogg and Rosco's crooked schemes. In the third and fourth seasons, when Shroyer left for [[Enos (TV series)|his own show]], his character was replaced by Deputy Cletus Hogg ([[Rick Hurst]]), Boss's cousin, who is slightly more wily than Enos but still a somewhat reluctant player in Hogg's plots.

Owing to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wind up helping Boss Hogg out of trouble, albeit grudgingly. More than once Hogg is targeted by former associates who are either seeking revenge or have [[Betrayal#Double cross|double crossed]] him after a scheme has unraveled in one way or another. Sheriff Coltrane also finds himself targeted in some instances. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually have to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; in other instances, the Dukes join forces with Hogg and Coltrane to tackle bigger threats to Hazzard or one of their respective parties. These instances became more frequent as the show progressed, and later seasons saw a number of stories where the Dukes and Hogg (and Coltrane) temporarily work together.

==Production==
{{one source|section|date=November 2018}}
The series was developed from the 1975 film ''[[Moonrunners]]''. Created by Gy Waldron in collaboration with ex-[[moonshine]]r [[Jerry Rushing]], this movie shares many [[Moonrunners#Connections to The Dukes of Hazzard|identical and very similar names and concepts with the subsequent TV series]]. Although itself essentially a comedy, this original movie was much cruder and edgier than the family-friendly TV series that evolved from it.

In 1977, Waldron was approached by [[Warner Bros.]] with the idea of developing ''Moonrunners'' into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from ''Moonrunners'', ultimately devising what became ''The Dukes of Hazzard''. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes for a mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in [[Covington, Georgia|Covington]] and [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby [[Atlanta]]. After completing production on the fifth episode, &quot;High Octane&quot;, the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks' time to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series. Part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the [[Columbia Ranch|Warner Bros. lot]] in [[Burbank, California]], to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series.

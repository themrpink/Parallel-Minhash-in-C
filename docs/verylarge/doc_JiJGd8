The ''[[dazibao]]'' may be slogans, poems, commentary and graphics often freely created and posted on walls in public spaces, factories and communes. They were vital to Mao's struggle in the Cultural Revolution, and Mao himself wrote his own ''dazibao'' at Beijing University on August 5, 1966, calling on the people to &quot;[[Bombard the Headquarters]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxxKXShYEJwC&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Chinese Posters: Art from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution |author=Lincoln Cushing |author2=Ann Tompkins |page=5 |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-0811859462 |access-date=June 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518105023/https://books.google.com/books?id=XxxKXShYEJwC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=May 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[xuanchuan]]hua'' were artworks produced by the government and sold cheaply in store to be displayed in homes or workplaces. The artists for these posters might be amateurs or uncredited professionals, and the posters were largely in a [[Socialist Realist]] visual style with certain conventions—for example, images of Mao were to be depicted as &quot;red, smooth, and luminescent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;posters&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC&amp;pg=PA360 |title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979 |author=Julia Frances Andrews |page=360 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 1995 |isbn=978-0520079816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional themes in art were sidelined the Cultural Revolution, and artists such as [[Feng Zikai]], [[Shi Lu]], and [[Pan Tianshou]] were persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbapwCJRtdUC&amp;pg=PA97 |title=King. p. 97 |access-date=June 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513192723/https://books.google.com/books?id=XbapwCJRtdUC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=May 13, 2016 |url-status=live |isbn=9780774859110 |last1=King |first1=Richard |date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the artists have been assigned to manual labour, and artists were expected to depict subjects that glorified the Cultural Revolution related to their labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC&amp;pg=PA352 |title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979 |author=Julia Frances Andrews |pages=351–52 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0520079816}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, in part to alleviate their suffering, several leading artists were recalled from manual labour or free from captivity under the initiative of Zhou Enlai to decorate hotels and railway stations defaced by Red Guards slogans.

===Historical relics===
[[File:Trip to Ningxia and Gansu.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Buddha statues were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution as were ancient Buddhist texts and whole Buddhist monasteries.|alt=]]
China's historical sites, artifacts and archives suffered devastating damage, as they were thought to be at the root of &quot;old ways of thinking.&quot; Artifacts were seized, museums and private homes ransacked, and any item found that was thought to represent bourgeois or [[feudal]] ideas was destroyed. There are few records of exactly how much was destroyed—Western observers suggest that much of China's thousands of years of history was in effect destroyed, or, later, smuggled abroad for sale, during the short ten years of the Cultural Revolution. Chinese historians compare the cultural suppression during the Cultural Revolution to [[Qin Shihuang]]'s [[great Confucian purge]]. [[Religious persecution]] intensified during this period, as a result of religion being viewed in opposition to Marxist–Leninist and Maoist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jiaqi Yan, Gao Gao, Danny Wynn Ye Kwok, ''Turbulent decade: a history of the cultural revolution'',  Honolulu Univ. of Hawai'i Press 1996, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Although being undertaken by some of the Revolution's enthusiastic followers, the destruction of historical relics was never formally sanctioned by the Communist Party, whose official policy was instead to protect such items. On May 14, 1967, the CCP central committee issued a document entitled ''Several suggestions for the protection of cultural relics and books during the Cultural Revolution''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao 2008. p. 21&quot;&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, enormous damage was inflicted on China's cultural heritage. For example, a survey in 1972 in Beijing of 18 key spots of cultural heritage, including the [[Temple of Heaven]] and [[Ming Dynasty Tombs|Ming Tombs]], showed extensive damage. Of the 80 cultural heritage sites in Beijing under municipal protection, 30 were destroyed, and of the 6,843 cultural sites under protection by Beijing government decision in 1958, 4,922 were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDhquEq5kTYC&amp;pg=PA446 |title=Beijing Record: A Physical and Political History of Planning Modern Beijing |author= Jun Wang |pages=446–47 |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd. |year=2011 |isbn=978-9814295727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin&quot;/&gt; Numerous valuable old books, paintings, and other cultural relics were also burnt to ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1iIkALdmNIC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Ten Years of Turbulence: The Chinese Cultural Revolution |author=Barbara Barnouin |author2=Changgen Yu |page=98 |year=2010 |publisher=Kegan Paul International, Routledge |isbn=978-0-7103-0458-2 |access-date=June 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513111204/https://books.google.com/books?id=D1iIkALdmNIC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=May 13, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavation and preservation after the destructive period in the 1960s, however, were protected, and several significant discoveries, such as the [[Terracotta Army]] and the [[Mawangdui]], occurred after the peak of the Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao 2008. p. 21&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the most prominent symbol of academic research in archaeology, the journal ''[[Kaogu (journal)|Kaogu]]'', did not publish during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Asian history'', Volume 21, 1987, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; After the most violent phase of the 1960s ended, the attack on traditional culture continued in 1973 with the ''Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius Campaign'' as part of the struggle against the moderate elements in the party.

=== Foreign relations ===
During the Cultural Revolution, the Communist China exported the &quot;Communist Revolution&quot; as well as the Communist ideology to multiple countries in [[Southeast Asia]], supporting the communist parties in [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Malaysian Communist Party|Malaysia]], [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|Laos]], [[Communist Party of Burma|Myanmar]] and in particular, the [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer Rouge in Cambodia]] which was responsible for the [[Cambodian genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2188861/maoism-global-history-how-china-exported-revolution |title=When Pol Pot lounged by Mao's pool: how China exported Maoism |date=2019-03-08 |website=South China Morning Post |access-date=2020-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisixiang.com/data/80986.html|title=黄华：文革时期的荒诞外交_爱思想|website=www.aisixiang.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least 90% of the foreign aid to the Khmer Rouge came from [[China]], with 1975 alone seeing at least [[US$]]1 billion in interest-free economic and military aid and US$20&amp;nbsp;million gift from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laura |first1=Southgate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54iUDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=By+mid-september+China+was+prepared+to+extend+to+Cambodia+a+total+of+US$1+billion&amp;pg=PA84 |title=ASEAN Resistance to Sovereignty Violation: Interests, Balancing and the Role of the Vanguard State |date=2019-05-08 |publisher=Policy Press |isbn=978-1-5292-0221-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the over 40 countries which had established diplomatic or half-diplomatic relations with China at the time, around 30 countries went into diplomatic disputes with China—some countries even terminated their diplomatic relations with China, including [[Central African Republic|Central Africa]], [[Ghana]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

===Communist Party opinions===
{{main|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}
[[File:Propaganda slogan removed - Wuhan University.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The central section of this wall shows the faint remnant marks of a propaganda slogan that was added during the Cultural Revolution, but has since been removed. The slogan reads &quot;Boundless faith in Chairman Mao.&quot;]]

To make sense of the mass chaos caused by Mao's leadership in the Cultural Revolution while preserving the Party's authority and legitimacy, Mao's successors needed to lend the event a &quot;proper&quot; historical judgment. On June 27, 1981, the Central Committee adopted the &quot;''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'',&quot; an official assessment of major historical events since 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;marxists.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China (Chinese Communism Subject Archive)|access-date=December 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213182749/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|archive-date=December 13, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resolution frankly noted Mao's leadership role in the movement, stating that &quot;chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'Cultural Revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong.&quot; It diluted blame on Mao himself by asserting that the movement was &quot;manipulated by the counterrevolutionary groups of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing,&quot; who caused its worst excesses. The Resolution affirmed that the Cultural Revolution &quot;brought serious disaster and turmoil to the Communist Party and the Chinese people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;marxists.org&quot;/&gt;

The official view aimed to separate Mao's actions during the Cultural Revolution from his &quot;heroic&quot; revolutionary activities during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It also separated Mao's personal mistakes from the correctness of the theory that he created, going as far as to rationalize that the Cultural Revolution contravened the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, which remains an official guiding ideology of the Party. Deng Xiaoping famously summed this up with the phrase &quot;Mao was 70% good, 30% bad.&quot;&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schiavenza|first1=Matt|title=Does a New Biography Tell the Whole Story on Deng Xiaoping?|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/does-new-biography-tell-whole-story-deng-xiaoping|publisher=Asia Society|access-date=October 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022060805/http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/does-new-biography-tell-whole-story-deng-xiaoping|archive-date=October 22, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Cultural Revolution, Deng affirmed that Maoist ideology was responsible for the revolutionary success of the Communist Party, but abandoned it in practice to favour &quot;[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot;, a very different model of state-directed [[market economics]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In Mainland China, the official view of the party now serves as the dominant framework for [[Chinese historiography]] of the period; alternative views (see below) are discouraged. Following the Cultural Revolution, a new genre of literature known as &quot;[[Scar literature]]&quot; (''Shanghen Wenxue'') emerged, being encouraged by the post-Mao government. Written mainly by educated youth such as Liu Xinhua, [[Zhang Xianliang]], and [[Liu Xinwu]], scar literature depicted the Revolution from a negative viewpoint, using their own perspectives and experiences as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the suppression of the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]], both liberals and conservatives within the Party accused each other of excesses that they claimed were reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. [[Li Peng]], who promoted the use of military force, cited that the student movement had taken inspiration from the grassroots populism of the Cultural Revolution and that if it is left unchecked, would eventually lead to a similar degree of mass chaos.&lt;ref&gt;''AsiaNews.it''&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Ziyang, who was sympathetic to the protestors, later accused his political opponents of illegally removing him from office by using &quot;Cultural Revolution-style&quot; tactics, including &quot;reversing black and white, exaggerating personal offenses, taking quotes out of context, issuing slander and lies... inundating the newspapers with critical articles making me out to be an enemy, and casual disregard for my personal freedoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative opinions in China===
Although the Chinese Communist Party officially condemns the Cultural Revolution, there are many Chinese people who hold more positive views of it, particularly amongst the working class, who benefited most from its policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gao 2008&quot;&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since Deng's ascendancy to power, the government has arrested and imprisoned figures who have taken a strongly pro-Cultural Revolution stance. For instance, in 1985, a young shoe-factory worker put up a poster on a factory wall in [[Xianyang]], Shaanxi, which declared that &quot;The Cultural Revolution was Good&quot; and led to achievements such as &quot;the building of the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], the creation of hybrid rice crops and the rise of people's consciousness.&quot; The factory worker was eventually sentenced to ten years in prison, where he died soon after &quot;without any apparent cause.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, [[Shen Tong]], author of ''Almost a Revolution'', has a positive view of some aspects of the Cultural Revolution. According to Shen, the trigger for the famous Tiananmen hunger-strikes of 1989 was a big-character poster (''dazibao''), a form of public political discussion that gained prominence during the Cultural Revolution. Shen remarked that the congregation of students from across the country to Beijing on trains and the hospitality they received from residents was reminiscent of the experiences of Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang&quot;/&gt;

Since the advent of the Internet, people inside and outside China have argued online that the Cultural Revolution had many beneficial qualities for China that have been denied by both the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party and Western media. Some hold that the Cultural Revolution 'cleansed' China from superstitions, religious dogma, and outdated traditions in a 'modernist transformation' that later made Deng's economic reforms possible. These sentiments increased following the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in 1999 when a segment of the population began to associate anti-Maoist viewpoints with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese New Left|Contemporary Maoists]] have also become more organized in the internet era, partially as a response to criticisms of Mao from academics and scholars. One Maoist website managed to collect thousands of signatures demanding punishment for those who publicly criticize Mao. Along with the call for legal action, this movement demands the establishment of agencies similar to Cultural Revolution-era &quot;neighborhood committees&quot;, in which &quot;citizens&quot; would report anti-Maoists to local public security bureaus. Maoist rhetoric and mass mobilization methods were resurgent in the interior city of Chongqing during the political career of [[Bo Xilai]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary China===
Public discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited in China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details of the Cultural Revolution, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks on the subject continue to abide by the &quot;official view&quot; (see above) of the events. Many government documents from the 1960s onward remain classified and are not open to formal inspection by private academics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fong&quot;&gt;Fong&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing, the Cultural Revolution is barely mentioned in its historical exhibits.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ian|title=At China's New Museum, History Toes Party Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/asia/04museum.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=October 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014205212/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/asia/04museum.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=October 14, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inroads made by numerous prominent sinologists, independent scholarly research of the Cultural Revolution is discouraged by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fong&quot; /&gt; There are concerns that as witnesses age and die, the opportunity to research the event thoroughly within China may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/world/asia/23iht-letter.html &quot;A Grim Chapter in History Kept Closed&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216210326/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/world/asia/23iht-letter.html |date=February 16, 2017}} article by Didi Kirsten Tatlow in ''The New York Times'', July 22, 2010, accessed July 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was reported that one practice typical of the Cultural Revolution, ''Fengqiao'', or public criticism of supposed counter-revolutionaries by a whole village, was experiencing an unexpected revival: but it is unclear whether this was an isolated incident or a sign of a renewed interest for cultural styles typical of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Tao, [https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ Fengqiao – a Maoist Revival to Attack Religion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031748/https://bitterwinter.org/fengqiao-a-maoist-revival-to-attack-religion/ |date=December 29, 2018}}, ''[[Bitter Winter]]'', December 27, 2018, accessed December 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside mainland China===
In Hong Kong, a [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|pro-Communist anti-colonial strike]] inspired by the Cultural Revolution was launched in 1967. Its excesses damaged the credibility of these activists for more than a generation in the eyes of Hong Kong residents.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished &amp; reduced 2003). Old Hong Kong – Volume Three. Central, Hong Kong: Text Form Asia books Ltd. {{ISBN|962-7283-61-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Taiwan, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] initiated the [[Chinese Cultural Renaissance]] to counter what he regarded as the destruction of traditional Chinese values by the Communists on the mainland. In [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], Communist leader and Chinese ally [[Enver Hoxha]] began a &quot;[[Cultural and Ideological Revolution]]&quot; organized along the same lines as the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Blumi|first1=Isa|date=1999|title=Hoxha's Class War: The Cultural Revolution and State Reformation, 1961-1971|journal=East European Quarterly|volume=33|issue=3|pages=303–326|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world at large, Mao Zedong emerged as a symbol of the anti-establishment, grassroots populism, and self-determination. His revolutionary philosophies found adherents in the [[Shining Path]] of Peru, the [[Naxalite]] insurgency in India, various political movements in Nepal, the U.S.-based [[Black Panther Party]],&lt;ref&gt;''Up Against the Wall,'' Curtis Austin, University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, 2006, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1960s [[counterculture]] movement in general.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} In 2007 [[Hong Kong Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] remarked that the Cultural Revolution represented the 'dangers of democracy', remarking &quot;People can go to the extreme like what we saw during the Cultural Revolution [...], when people take everything into their own hands, then you cannot govern the place.&quot;&lt;ref name=hk&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=HK's Tsang apologises for gaffe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7042941.stm|date=October 13, 2007|work=BBC News|access-date=April 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728181344/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7042941.stm|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks caused controversy in Hong Kong and were later retracted with an accompanying apology.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

===Academic debate===
Scholars and academics continue to debate why events unfolded the way they did, Mao's role, how the Cultural Revolution began, and what it ''was''. These debates have changed over the decades as researchers explored new sources.

In the 1960s, while many scholars dismissed Mao's initiatives as ideological and destructive, others sympathized with his concern for equality, opposition to bureaucratism and corruption, and individual selfishness. They saw Maoism as a populist insistence on mass participation, mass criticism and the right to rebel, and a determination to wipe out a new ruling class. By the 1980s, however, Harvard University sociologist [[Andrew Walder]] wrote that the “public opinion in the field had changed markedly”. Most in the field now “seem convinced that that the Cultural Revolution was a human disaster, even a historical crime, something on the order of Hitler’s holocaust and Stalin’s great terror.” Walder argued that the failures of the Cultural Revolution did not come from poor implementation, bureaucratic sabotage, disloyalty, or lingering class antagonisms. If things turned out differently from what Mao expected, Walder concluded, this was “probably due to the fact that Mao did not know what he wanted, or that he did know what he was doing, or both.... the outcomes are what one should have expected, given the Maoist doctrine and aims.”
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Walder|first1 =Andrew |title =Actually Existing Maoism |journal =Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs |volume =18 |issue = 18|pages =155–166 |date =1987|jstor = 2158588|doi = 10.2307/2158588|s2cid =156609951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the debate continues because the movement contains many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven by a series of grassroots popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. Virtually all English-language books published since the 1980s paint a negative picture of the movement. Historian Anne F. Thurston wrote that it &quot;led to loss of culture, and of spiritual values; loss of hope and ideals; loss of time, truth and of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu84-85|Thurston 1984–85]]. pp. 605–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnouin and Yu summarized the Cultural Revolution as &quot;a political movement that produced unprecedented social divisions, mass mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary cruelty, torture, killings, and even civil war&quot;, calling Mao &quot;one of the most tyrannical despots of the twentieth century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 217&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars challenge the mainstream portrayals of the Cultural Revolution and offer to understand it in a more positive light. Mobo Gao, writing in ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'',&lt;ref name=about&gt;Pluto Press, [http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101121337/http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp |date=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the movement benefited millions of Chinese citizens, particularly agricultural and industrial workers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and sees it as egalitarian and genuinely populist, citing continued Maoist nostalgia in China today as remnants of its positive legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some draw a distinction between intention and performance. {{sfnb|Walder|1987| p = 159}} While Mao's leadership was pivotal at the beginning of the movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed, it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision.&lt;ref name=jinqiu&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jin|first1=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Palo Alto, California|isbn=0-8047-3529-8|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning many 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.&lt;ref name=jinqiu/&gt;

Academic interest has also focused on the movement's relationship with Mao's personality. Mao envisioned himself as a wartime guerrilla leader, which made him wary of the bureaucratic nature of peacetime governance. With the Cultural Revolution Mao was simply &quot;returning to form&quot;, once again taking on the role of a guerrilla leader fighting against an institutionalized party bureaucracy. Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, paint the movement as neither a ''bona fide'' war over ideological purity ''nor'' a mere power struggle to remove Mao's political rivals.&lt;ref name=rmms&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFaquhar|first1=Roderick|title=Mao's Last Revolution|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-02332-3|first2=Michael|last2=Schoenhals|url=https://archive.org/details/maoslastrevoluti00macf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Mao's personal motivations were undoubtedly pivotal to the Cultural Revolution, they reasoned that other complex factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the [[Sino-Soviet Split|ideological rift between China and the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev's ouster, and the failures of the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name=rmms/&gt; They conclude that the movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive ''and'' preserve the invulnerability of his ideas after his death.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass hysteria surrounding the Cultural Revolution was also unprecedented. Historian Phillip Short contends that the Cultural Revolution contained elements that were akin to a form of religious worship.&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Phillip|title=Mao's Bloody Revolution: Revealed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd0aW-4mV68|access-date=November 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118133310/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd0aW-4mV68|archive-date=November 18, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's godlike status during the period yielded him ultimate definitional power over Communist doctrine, yet the esoteric and often contradictory nature of his writings led to endless wars over its interpretation, with both conservatives and liberals drawing on Mao's teachings to achieve their divergent goals.{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} Many factional struggles were not unlike religious wars, with all sides claiming allegiance to the most &quot;authentic&quot; form of Maoism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]] attribute all the destruction of the Cultural Revolution to Mao personally, with more sympathetic portrayals of his allies and opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Chang and Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qarshi''' ({{lang-uz|'''Qarshi'''}} / Қарши; {{lang-fa|'''نخشب'''}}  ''Nakhshab''; {{lang-ru|Карши}} '''Karshi''') is a city in southern [[Uzbekistan]]. It is the capital of  [[Qashqadaryo Region]] and has a population of 197,600 (1999 census estimate). The population of Qarshi on April 24, 2014 is approximately 222,898. It is about 520&amp;nbsp;km south-southwest of [[Tashkent]], and about 335&amp;nbsp;km north of Uzbekistan's border with [[Afghanistan]]. It is located at latitude 38° 51' 48N; longitude 65° 47' 52E at an altitude of 374 meters. The city is important in [[natural gas]] production, but Qarshi is also famous for its production of woven flat [[carpets]].

==History==
Originally the [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] city of '''Nakhshab''' (which could be possibly named '''[[Eucratideia]]''' during the rule of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Metropolitana: Or Universal Dictionary of Knowledge, Volume 23, edited by Edward Smedley, Hugh James Rose, Henry John Rose, 1923, page 260.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Islamic]] Uzbek (Turkic) city of '''Nasaf''', and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] city of '''Qarshi''' (pronounced ''Kharsh''), Qarshi was the second city of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. It is in the center of a fertile [[oasis]] that produces [[wheat]], [[cotton]], and [[silk]] and was a stop on the 11-day [[Camel train|caravan]] route between [[Balkh]] and [[Bukhara]]. The Mongol [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagataid]] khans [[Kebek]] and [[Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur|Qazan]] built palaces here on the site of [[Chinggis Khaan]]'s summer pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, pp. 341-2 states that both khans used Qarshi as a capital&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=December 2019}} In 1364, Timur also built a fortified palace with moats in what is now the southern part of the city. The modern name &quot;Qarshi&quot; means fort.

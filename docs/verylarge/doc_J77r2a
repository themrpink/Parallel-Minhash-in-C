==== Korea ====
In Korea, fish sauce is called ''eojang'' ({{lang|ko|어장}}).

Across the [[Korean Peninsula]], ''aekjeot'' ({{lang|ko|액젓}}, literally &quot;liquid ''[[jeotgal]]''&quot;), a type of fish sauce usually made from fermented [[Engraulis japonicus|anchovies]] or [[sand lance]]s, is used as a crucial ingredient in many types of [[kimchi]], both for taste and fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Confidentials |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/food-and-drink/korean/review-seoul-kimchi-upper-brook-street |title=REVIEW &amp;#124; Seoul Kimchi, Upper Brook Street &amp;#124; Confidentials Manchester |location=Manchester |publisher=Manchester Confidential |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/thousands-prepare-kimchi-feast-for-seoul-s-poor/3262656.html|title=Thousands prepare kimchi feast for Seoul's poor|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2016-11-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108134827/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/thousands-prepare-kimchi-feast-for-seoul-s-poor/3262656.html|archivedate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jejudo|Jeju island]], ''eoganjang'' ({{lang|ko|어간장}}), made of fermented ''godori'' (young [[Scomber japonicus|chub mackerel]]) or [[Trachurus japonicus|horse mackerel]], is used in place of [[soy sauce]].

==Nutrition contents==
Common commercial brands of fish sauce generally contain about 50% to 60% of the FDA's daily recommended amount of sodium per tablespoon serving. Most commercial brands of reasonable quality contain one or two grams of protein per serving; however, higher-quality brands may have four grams of protein or more, while lower-quality brands may have less than one gram of protein per serving. Fish sauce has an insignificant amount of carbohydrates and fats. [[Vitamin B12]], [[vitamin B-6]], and [[magnesium]] are present in small amounts.

'''Apple sauce''' or '''applesauce''' is a [[sauce]] made of [[apple]]s. It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and may be spiced or sweetened. Apple sauce is inexpensive and widely consumed in [[North America]] and some of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmatier|first=Robert Allen|title=Food: a dictionary of literal and nonliteral terms|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-31436-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0313314365/page/11 11]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_0313314365|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of [[apple varieties]] is used to make apple sauce, depending on the preference for sweetness or tartness.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Huffstetler, &quot;The 11 Best Apples for Applesauce&quot;, ''The Spruce Eats'' [https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-apples-for-applesauce-1389162 10/02/2019]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Recommended Uses of Apple Varieties&quot;, in Tim Burford, ''Apples of North America: Exceptional Varieties for Gardeners, Growers, and Cooks'', 2013, {{isbn|1604692499}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQp5AAAAQBAJ&amp;vq=applesauce&amp;pg=PA278 p. 278]&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, [[Sour Apples|sour apples]] were used to make savory apple sauce.&lt;ref name=&quot;hale&quot;/&gt;

Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available at [[retail]] grocers.

==Preparation==
[[File:Homemade-applesauce-in-progress.png|thumb|left|175px|Making apple sauce]]	
Apple sauce is made by cooking apples with water or [[apple cider]] (fresh apple juice). More acidic apples will render a finer [[purée]]; the highly acidic [[Bramley apple]] creates a very fine purée. The apples may or may not be peeled. If they are not peeled, the peels and [[Seed|seeds]] are typically separated in a [[food mill]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Bittman]], ''How to Cook Everything: Simple Recipes for Great Food'', 20th anniversary edition, 2019, {{isbn|1328545679}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z99-DwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;lpg=PA364&amp;dq=%22food%20mill%22&amp;pg=PA364 p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sugar]] and spices such as [[cinnamon]], [[allspice]], and even [[Red Hots|Red Hot]] candies may be added for flavor. [[Lemon juice]], [[citric acid]], or other [[acidifier]]s may be used to preserve the color and ensure a high enough [[acid|acidity]] for safe storage. [[Ascorbic acid|Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)]] also preserves the color.

Apple sauce can be made by baking rather than boiling, in which case the apples are peeled and cored before cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliza Acton]], ''Modern Cookery, for Private Families'', 1860, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 p. 124]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home or commercially [[canning|canned]] apple sauce is sterilized by heat to preserve freshness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.applesfromny.com/about/apple-products/applesauce|title=Applesauce|website=NY Apple Association|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple butter===
{{main|Apple butter}}
Apple butter is a highly concentrated version of apple sauce. Its high concentration of sugar gives it a long shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstein|first=Mark|title=In Praise of Apples: A Harvest of History, Horticulture &amp; Recipes|year=1999|publisher=Lark Books|isbn=978-1-57990-124-0|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq6k9IyHd74C&amp;pg=PA135|access-date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Apple sauce is served as a [[side dish]] in northern Europe and north America.

In [[Swedish cuisine|Sweden]] and [[British cuisine|Britain]], it is commonly served with roast pork and goose. In British and [[Spanish cuisine]], it is commonly served as [[pork chops and apple sauce]]. The [[Danish cuisine|Danish]] [[æbleflæsk]] combines the pork with apple sauce while cooking it.

In [[Central European cuisine|Central Europe]], it accompanies [[potato pancake]]s, in particular, in the [[Rhineland]], it is served with [[Reibekuchen]], and in [[Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine|Ashkenazi cuisine]], it is the standard accompaniment for [[Hanukkah]] [[latke]]s; it also accompanies [[matzah brei]]. Apple sauce is served with many foods in [[Germanic cuisine]]: [[flurgönder]], a smoked meat; various kinds of [[spätzle]], including [[Schupfnudeln]]; [[Swiss cuisine|Swiss]][[:de:Älplermagronen|''Älplermagronen'']], a kind of macaroni and cheese. In [[Dutch cuisine|Netherlands]] and [[Belgian cuisine|Belgian]] cuisine, apple sauce is part of the common dish of chicken, french fries, and apple sauce (''kip, frieten/patat en appelmoes''); it is especially popular among children, who dip their fries in [[mayonnaise]] first, then apple sauce.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Dutch Table&quot; [https://www.thedutchtable.com/2013/09/appelmoes.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cuisines, apple sauce is a common accompaniment to [[blood sausage]]: the [[German cuisine|German]] [[Himmel und Erde]]; the Luxembourg [[träipen]]; and the [[French cuisine|French]] ''boudin noir''. In fact, in France, the only savory dish normally served with apple sauce (''[[compote]] de pommes'') is ''[[boudin]]'' sausage, both white and black.{{cn|date=March 2020}} It is also served with other sausage-like preparations, like [[goetta]] and [[knipp]].

Apple sauce may also be served as a dessert in most [[European cuisine]]s, or used as an ingredient in [[applesauce cake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theodora.com/recipies/cakes_and_frostings/applesauce_cake.html |title=Applesauce Cake, Source: U.S. Department of Defence |work=Theodora's Recipies [sic]|access-date= 1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple sauce may be used as a sauce for [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] [[pierogi]]s, Swedish [[Äggakaka]], [[Ukranian cuisine|Ukrainian]] [[syrniki]] pancakes, [[Central European cuisine|Central European]] [[Palatschinke]]n, German ''[[Kaiserschmarrn]]'', and various kinds of sweet and savory dumplings (''[[Knödel]]''). In [[Scandinavian cuisine]], it sometimes served with breakfast [[filmjölk]], a kind of fermented milk.

Formerly, heavily sweetened and boiled-down apple sauce was prepared for winter storage. Made with sour apples, it was eaten with meat; made with sweet apples, it was eaten with tea.&lt;ref name=&quot;hale&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sarah Josepha Buell|title=The good housekeeper: or, The way to live well and to be well while we live : containing directions for choosing and preparing food, in regard to health, economy and taste|year=1839|publisher=Weeks, Jordan|page=[https://archive.org/details/goodhousekeeper00halegoog/page/n85 79]|url=https://archive.org/details/goodhousekeeper00halegoog|author-link=Sarah Josepha Hale|access-date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bavarian [[Mustard (condiment)|sweet mustard]] may be made with applesauce, and is typically served with [[Weißwurst]] (similar to ''boudin blanc'') or [[Leberkäse]] (a sort of pâté).

==In diets==
The [[BRAT diet]] and [[CRAM diet]] include apple sauce, and are given to children with [[diarrhea]] and stomach problems.&lt;ref name=Mac2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackell|first1=S|title=Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=1 December 2005|volume=41 Suppl 8|pages=S547-52|pmid=16267717|doi=10.1086/432950|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King CK, Glass R, Bresee JS, Duggan C |title=Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=52 |issue=RR-16 |pages=1–16 | date=November 2003 |pmid=14627948 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5216a1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
{{references|section|date=November 2020}}
Apples are the third most internationally traded fruit, behind bananas and grapes. The global applesauce trade is expanding, with a market valued at US$ 1611.1 million in 2017 projected to reach US$ 2169.3 million by the end of the year 2026. This increase in demand can be attributed to an increase in interest for apple flavored products, with increased global consumption of apple flavored juices and sauces.

Applesauce is most commonly packaged in cups, jars, pouches, and cans. Applesauce cups are the largest segment of the applesauce market, comprising 40.9% of the [[Revenue sharing|revenue share]] in 2017.

Brick and mortar retail stores account for about 85% of the market share for applesauce, as compared to 15% among [[Electronic retailing|e-retailers]].

==Origins==
{{Unreliable sources|date=November 2020}}
Sauces made with apples date to at least the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Food history: applesauce {{!}} ErinNudi.com|url=https://www.erinnudi.com/2014/09/05/food-history-applesauce/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=www.erinnudi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Food Timeline--history notes: algae to creamed onions|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq.html#applesauce|access-date=2020-11-18|website=www.foodtimeline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple butters were brought to the Americas by German immigrants such as the [[Moravians]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. They are traditionally associated with the [[Appalachia|Appalachian]] region of the [[United States]] and Southern [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] '''Convention on the Rights of the Child''' (commonly abbreviated as the '''CRC''' or '''UNCRC''') is an international [[international human rights instruments|human rights treaty]] which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childrightscampaign.org/what-is-the-crc/ |title=What is the CRC? |access-date=7 November 2020 |date=2018 |editor=The Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509140102/https://www.childrightscampaign.org/what-is-the-crc/ |archive-date=9 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the [[age of majority]] is attained earlier under national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx |website=Website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) |date=20 November 1989 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=6 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092120/http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations that have ratified this convention or have acceded to it are bound to it by [[international law]]. When a state has signed the treaty but not ratified it, it is not yet bound by the treaty's provisions but is already obliged to not act contrary to the treaty's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/how-convention-works |title=How the Convention on the Rights of the Child works.

The UN [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], composed of 18 independent experts, is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Convention by the states that have ratified it. Their governments are required to report to and appear before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child periodically to be examined on their progress with regards to the advancement of the implementation of the Convention and the status of child rights in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/CRCIntro.aspx |url-status=live |title=Committee on the Rights of the Child.

Also, individuals can appeal to the Committee on the Rights of the Child if they believe that rights according to the Convention have been violated. The third possibility for monitoring the implementation of the Convention are inquiries that the Committee on the Rights of the Child can carry out on their own initiative if they have reliable information that leads them to believe that the rights stated in the Convention have been violated by a member state. However, «states [...] may opt out from the inquiry procedure, at the time of signature or ratification or accession».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/TBPetitions/Pages/HRTBPetitions.aspx |url-status=live |title=Human Rights Bodies - Complaints Procedures |access-date=7 November 2020 |editor=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419083255/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/TBPetitions/Pages/HRTBPetitions.aspx |archive-date=5 November 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a year, the Committee submits a report to the Third Committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which also hears a statement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=CRIN/&gt;

==Contents==
The Convention deals with child-specific needs and rights. It requires that the &quot;nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law&quot;. Ratifying states must act in the [[best interests]] of the child.

In all jurisdictions implementing the Convention requires compliance with [[child custody]] and guardianship laws as every child has basic rights, including the [[right to life]], to their own name and identity, to be raised by their [[parent]]s within a family or cultural grouping, and to have a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with both parents, even if they are [[Legal separation|separated]].

The Convention obliges states to allow parents to exercise their parental responsibilities. The Convention also acknowledges that children have the right to express their opinions and to have those opinions heard and acted upon when appropriate, to be protected from abuse or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and to have their [[privacy]] protected, and it requires that their lives not be subject to excessive interference.

The Convention also obliges signatory states to provide separate legal representation for a child in any judicial dispute concerning their care and asks that the child's viewpoint be heard in such cases.

The Convention forbids [[capital punishment]] for children. In its General Comment 8 (2006) the Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that there was an &quot;obligation of all state parties to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment and all other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/6545c032cb57bff5c12571fc002e834d/$FILE/G0740771.pdf General Comment 8] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204164928/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/6545c032cb57bff5c12571fc002e834d/$FILE/G0740771.pdf |date=4 December 2010 }}, Committee on the Rights of the Child.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 19 of the Convention states that state parties must &quot;take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:UN Convention on the Rights of the Child#Article 19|Article 19, Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;/ref&gt; but it makes no reference to [[corporal punishment]].

===Global standards and cultural relativism===
Global human rights standards were challenged at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna (1993) when a number of governments (prominently China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran) raised serious objections to the idea of [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Ben|title=Defining the intolerable: Child work, global standards and cultural relativism|journal=Childhood|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|pages=133–144|doi=10.1177/0907568299006001010|s2cid=27668970}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are unresolved tensions between &quot;universalistic&quot; and &quot;relativistic&quot; approaches in the establishment of standards and strategies designed to prevent or overcome the abuse of children's capacity to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1999&quot;/&gt;

=== Tiangong 1 and Tiangong 2 (2011–2019) ===
{{main|Tiangong program}}

China's first space laboratory, [[Tiangong-1]] was launched in September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASAspaceflight&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/china-major-human-space-flight-milestone-tiangong-1s-launch/|title=China launches TianGong-1 to mark next human space flight milestone |first=Rui |last=Barbosa |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncrewed [[Shenzhou 8]] then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in November 2011. The crewed [[Shenzhou 9]] then docked with Tiangong-1 in June 2012, the crewed [[Shenzhou 10]] in 2013. A second space laboratory [[Tiangong-2]] was launched in September 2016, while a plan for [[Tiangong-3]] was merged with Tiangong-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiangong&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=China's Tiangong 1 Space Station to Burn Up|website=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|first=David|last=Dickinson|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/chinas-tiangong-1-set-to-reenter-in-the-coming-months/|date=10 November 2017|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, China informed the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] that Tiangong-1's altitude was decaying and that it would soon [[Atmospheric entry|reenter]] the atmosphere and break up.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiangong&quot;/&gt; The reentry was projected to occur in late March or early April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=China's Tiangong-1 due for uncontrolled re-entry, soon|first=Deborah|last=Byrd|website=[[EarthSky]]|date=March 7, 2018|url=http://earthsky.org/space/china-tiangong-1-uncontrolled-re-entry-mar-apr-2018|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, Tiangong-1 [[#Re-entry|reentered]] over the South [[Pacific Ocean]], northwest of [[Tahiti]], on 2 April 2018 at 00:15 UTC.&lt;ref name=&quot;space-track&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space-track.org/basicspacedata/query/class/tip/NORAD_CAT_ID/37820/orderby/ID%20DESC/format/html/emptyresult/show|url-access=registration|title=Tracking and Impact Prediction |work=Space-Track.Org|publisher=JFSCC/J3|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;18SPCS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=18 Space Control Squadron|title=18 SPCS on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/18SPCS/status/980614448745406465|website=Twitter|accessdate=2 April 2018|language=en|quote=UPDATE: #JFSCC confirmed #Tiangong1 reentered the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean at ~5:16 p.m. (PST) April 1 in an uncontrolled manner.

In July 2019 the [[China Manned Space Engineering Office]] announced that it was planning to deorbit Tiangong-2 in the near future, but no specific date was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=China set to carry out controlled deorbiting of Tiangong-2 space lab|first=Andrew|last=Jones|newspaper=SpaceNews|date=12 July 2019|url=https://spacenews.com/china-set-to-carry-out-controlled-deorbiting-of-tiangong-2-space-lab/|accessdate=17 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station subsequently made a controlled reentry on 19 July and burned up over the South Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=China has deorbited its experimental space station|newspaper=[[The Verge]]|first=Andrew|last=Liptak|date=20 July 2019|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701831/china-tiangong-2-deorbited-experimental-space-station|accessdate=21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
===ISS (1998–present)===
{{main|International Space Station}}

[[File:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|thumb|International Space Station under construction]]
The ISS is divided into two main sections, the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] (ROS) and the [[US Orbital Segment]] (USOS). The first module of the International Space Station, [[Zarya]], was launched in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;CASIS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=History and Timeline of the ISS|website=[[Center for the Advancement of Science in Space]]|url=https://www.iss-casis.org/about/iss-timeline/|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Orbital Segment's &quot;second-generation&quot; modules were able to launch on [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]], fly to the correct orbit, and dock themselves without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/mae/aerospace/publications/JDSC_RoadToAutonomy.pdf |title=Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering |publisher=Usu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections are automatically made for power, data, gases, and propellants. The Russian autonomous approach allows the assembly of space stations prior to the launch of crew.

The Russian &quot;second-generation&quot; modules are able to be reconfigured to suit changing needs. As of 2009, [[RKK Energia]] was considering the removal and reuse of some modules of the ROS on the [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex]] after the end of mission is reached for the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|work=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | first=Anatoly | last=Zak}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2017 the head of Roscosmos said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied, and there were now no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/international-partners-in-no-rush-regarding-future-of-iss/ |title=International partners in no rush regarding future of ISS |website=[[SpaceNews]] |date=25 September 2017 |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the main US modules launched on the [[Space Shuttle]] and were attached to the ISS by crews during [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]. Connections for electrical power, data, propulsion, and cooling fluids are also made at this time, resulting in an integrated block of modules that is not designed for disassembly and must be deorbited as one mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9794/chapter/8|isbn=978-0-309-06938-0|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|pages=28–30|author=Thomas Kelly|title=Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Axiom Orbital Segment]] is a planned commercial segment to be added to the ISS starting in the mid 2020s. Axiom Space gained NASA approval for the venture in January 2020. Up to three Axiom modules will attach to the International Space Station. The first module could be launched no later than 2024 and will be docked to the forward port of [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']], requiring relocation of the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|PMA-2]]. Axiom Space plans to attach up to two additional modules to its first core module, and send private astronauts to inhabit the modules. The modules could one day detach into the [[Axiom Station]] in a manner similar to Russia's proposed OPSEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-01-28|title=NASA selects Axiom Space to build commercial space station module|url=https://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-axiom-space-to-build-commercial-space-station-module/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=SpaceNews|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==

[[File:Sts100-Destiny.jpg|thumb|Astronauts peer out of Destiny Laboratory, 2001]]
Two types of space stations have been flown: monolithic and modular. Monolithic stations consist of a single vehicle and are launched by one rocket. Modular stations consist of two or more separate vehicles that are launched independently and docked on orbit. Modular stations are currently preferred due to lower costs and greater flexibility. Both types can be refueled by cargo craft, such as [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]].{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

A space station is a complex vehicle that must incorporate many interrelated subsystems, including structure, electrical power, thermal control, [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude determination and control]]&lt;!-- attitude (=orientation), not altitude (=height)--&gt;, orbital navigation and propulsion, automation and robotics, computing and communications, environmental and life support, crew facilities, and crew and cargo transportation. Stations must serve a useful role, which drives the capabilities required.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

===Materials===
Space stations are often made from durable materials that have to weather [[space radiation]], internal pressure, [[micrometeoroids]], and thermal effects of the sun and cold temperatures for very long periods of time. They are typically made from [[stainless steel]], [[titanium]] and high-quality [[aluminum alloys]], with layers of insulation such as [[Kevlar]] as a ballistics shield protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.roscosmos.ru/202/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitability===
{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}

[[File:First 8K Video from Space - Ultra HD VP9.webm|thumb|thumbtime=25|Advanced plant habitat on the International Space Station]]
The space station environment presents a variety of challenges to human habitability, including short-term problems such as the limited supplies of air, water and food and the need to manage [[waste heat]], and long-term ones such as [[weightlessness]] and relatively high levels of [[ionizing radiation]]. These conditions can create long-term health problems for space-station inhabitants, including [[muscle atrophy]], [[Spaceflight osteopenia|bone deterioration]], [[Space adaptation syndrome|balance disorders]], [[Visual impairment due to intracranial pressure|eyesight disorders]], and elevated risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20140127&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Beings Not Made for Space |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/bodies-not-made-for-space.html |date=27 January 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future [[space habitat]]s may attempt to address these issues, and could be designed for occupation beyond the weeks or months that current missions typically last. Possible solutions include the creation of [[artificial gravity]] by a [[Rotating wheel space station|rotating structure]], the inclusion of [[radiation shielding]], and the development of on-site agricultural ecosystems. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, becoming essentially &quot;cities in space&quot; where people would reside semi-permanently. For now, no space station suitable for long-term human residence has ever been built, since the current launch costs for even a small station are not economically or politically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Space Settlements: A Design Study|year=1975|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/s.s.doc.html|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental microbiology===

Molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. Despite an expanding array of molecular approaches for detecting microorganisms, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of the microbial cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/11may_locad3/|author=Trudy E. Bell|year=2007|title=Preventing &quot;Sick&quot; Spaceships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
{{main|Space stations and habitats in fiction}}
Space stations, sometimes referred to as star bases, are a common trope in [[science fiction]]. Notable works they appear in include TV shows ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', among others. Typically they act as [[drydock]]s, battle stations or trading outposts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Westfahl2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Westfahl|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_3kNDKhxIcC&amp;pg=PA926|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32953-1|pages=926, 1239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French grammar''' is the set of rules by which the [[French language]] creates statements, questions and commands. In many respects, it is quite similar to that of the other [[Romance languages]].

French is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s.

==Verbs==
{{main|French verbs}}

Verbs in French are conjugated to reflect the following information:
* a [[grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]],&lt;ref name=&quot;conditional&quot;&gt;In some of its uses, the conditional acts as a tense of the indicative mood; in other uses, including the use from which it takes its name, it acts as a distinct mood.&lt;/ref&gt; [[infinitive]], or [[gerundive]]&lt;ref name=&quot;analytic information&quot;&gt;The gerundive mood, the perfect, and the passive and reflexive voices are not [[synthetic language|synthetic]] but [[analytic language|analytic]]; that is, they are expressed using multi-word verb forms.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* a [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Past tense|past]], [[Present tense|present]], or [[Future tense|future]], though not all tenses can be combined with all moods)
* an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]])
* a [[grammatical voice|voice]] ([[Active voice|active]], [[Passive voice|passive]],&lt;ref name=&quot;analytic information&quot;/&gt; or [[reflexive voice|reflexive]]&lt;ref name=&quot;analytic information&quot;/&gt;)

Some of these features are combined into seven [[tense–aspect–mood]] combinations.  The simple (one-word) forms are commonly referred to as the present, the simple past or [[preterite]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pret and imp&quot;&gt;The preterite and imperfect are sometimes called, somewhat redundantly, the ''preterite past'' and ''imperfect past''. The preterite is also called the ''simple past'', a translation of its French name (''le passé simple'').&lt;/ref&gt; (past tense, perfective aspect), the [[imperfect]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pret and imp&quot;/&gt; (past tense, imperfective aspect), the future, the conditional,&lt;ref name=&quot;conditional&quot;/&gt; the present subjunctive, and the imperfect subjunctive. However, the simple past is rarely used in informal French, and the imperfect subjunctive is rarely used in modern French.

Verbs in the finite moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and conditional) are also conjugated to [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, or third) and [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural). As in English, the subject must be included (except in the imperative mood); in other words, unlike other [[Romance language]]s, French is neither a [[null-subject language]] nor a [[pro-drop language]].

[[Auxiliary verb]]s are combined with past participles of main verbs to produce compound tenses, including the compound past ''([[passé composé]])''. For most main verbs the auxiliary is (the appropriate form of) ''avoir'' (&quot;to have&quot;), but for reflexive verbs and certain intransitive verbs the auxiliary is a form of ''être'' (&quot;to be&quot;). The participle agrees with the subject when the auxiliary is ''être'', and with a preceding [[direct object]] (if any) when the auxiliary is ''avoir''. Forms of ''être'' are also used with the past participles of transitive verbs to form the passive voice.

The imperative mood, which only has first-person plural and second-person singular and plural forms, usually has forms similar or identical to the corresponding ones in the present indicative.

==Nouns==

=== Gender ===
Every French [[noun]] has a [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun referring to a human usually corresponds to the noun's natural gender (i.e., its referent's [[sex]] or [[gender]]). For such nouns, there will very often be one noun of each gender, with the choice of noun being determined by the natural gender of the person described; for example, a male singer is a ''chanteur'', while a female singer is either a ''chanteuse'' (a pop singer) or a ''cantatrice'' (an opera singer). A plural noun that refers to both males and females is masculine. In some cases, the two nouns are identical in form, with the difference only being marked in neighbouring words (due to gender agreement; see [[#Articles and determiners|below]]); a Catholic man is ''un catholique'', while a Catholic woman is ''une catholique''. Nonetheless, there are some such nouns that retain their grammatical gender regardless of natural gender; ''personne'' 'person' is always feminine, while (at least in &quot;standard&quot; French) ''professeur'' 'teacher' is always masculine. In Canadian French, ''une professeure'' is the standard feminine form, which is becoming more and more common in European French.

A noun's gender is not perfectly predictable from its form, but there are some trends. As a very broad trend, nouns ending in ''-e'' tend to be feminine (e.g., ''une étoile'' 'star', ''une voiture'' 'car'), while the rest tend to be masculine (e.g., ''un ballon'' 'balloon', ''un stylo'' 'pen'), but it sometimes can be the opposite. More consistently, some endings, such as ''-sion'', ''-tion'', ''-aison'' and ''-ité'' occur almost exclusively with feminine nouns, while others, such as ''-aire'' and ''-isme''  occur almost exclusively with masculine ones. Many nouns ending in -e preceded by double consonants are also masculine (e.g. ''cadre'', ''arbre'', ''signe'', ''meuble''). Nonetheless, a noun that seems masculine judging by its ending might actually be feminine (e.g., ''la peau'' 'skin') or vice versa (e.g., ''un squelette'' 'skeleton'). [[Noun clause]]s are masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguee.fr/francais-anglais/search?source=anglais&amp;query=it+is+disappointing|title=it is disappointing - Traduction française – Linguee|author=|date=|work=Linguee.fr|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very small number of nouns can be used either in masculine or feminine gender with the same meaning (e.g., ''après-midi'' 'afternoon'). Often one gender is preferred over the other. Some (very rare) nouns change gender according to the way they are used: the words ''amour'' 'love' and ''délice'' 'pleasure' are masculine in singular and feminine in plural; the word ''orgue'' 'organ' is masculine, but when used emphatically in plural to refer to a church organ it becomes feminine (''les grandes orgues''); the plural noun ''gens'' 'people' changes gender in a very unusual way, being usually masculine but triggering feminine agreement when certain adjectives precede the word.

Other nouns change meaning depending on which grammatical gender they are used in. For example, ''le critique'' (masculine) refers to a critic, while ''la critique'' (feminine) means criticism. Similarly, ''le voile'' means &quot;veil&quot;, whereas ''la voile'' means &quot;sail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arragon |first=Jean-Claude |date=1986 |title=French Grammar |publisher=NTC Publishing Group |page=[https://archive.org/details/frenchgrammar00arra/page/58 58] |isbn=0-8442-3772-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/frenchgrammar00arra/page/58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocabulary of French includes many [[homophone]]s, i.e., pairs of words with different spellings but the same pronunciation. Grammatical gender, however, may serve to distinguish some of these. For example, ''le pot'' 'pot' and ''la peau'' 'skin' are both pronounced {{IPA|[po]}} but disagree in gender. Similarly ''le pet'' (fart) and ''la paix'' (peace), both {{IPA|[pɛ]}}.

=== Number ===
As in English, nouns inflect for [[grammatical number|number]]. In terms of spelling, the plural is usually formed from the singular by adding the letter ''-s'' (cf. ''maison &gt; maisons'' 'houses'). Nouns ending in ''-au, -eu,'' and ''-ou'' often take the ending ''-x'' instead (cf. ''jeu &gt; jeux'' 'games'). However, the endings ''-s'' and ''-x'' are mute outside of liaison contexts, so the plural form of a noun generally has the same pronunciation as the singular. Nouns which end in ''-s, -x'' or ''-z'' in the singular are left unchanged in the plural in both pronunciation and spelling (cf. ''croix &gt; croix'' 'crosses', both pronounced [kʁwa]).

In spoken French, therefore, the plurality of a noun generally cannot be determined from the pronunciation of the noun, but it is commonly marked by the form of a preceding article or determiner (cf. ''la maison'' [la mɛzɔ̃] 'the house' &gt; '' '''les''' maisons'' [le mɛzɔ̃] 'the houses'; ''mon frère'' [mɔ̃ fʁɛːʁ] 'my brother' &gt; '' '''mes''' frères'' [me fʁɛːʁ] 'my brothers').

[[Liaison (French)|Liaison]] between a plural noun and a following adjective is only common in careful speech, for example, by newsreaders. In this case the plural ending ''-s'' or ''-x'' may be pronounced: ''des fenêtre'''s''' ouvertes'' {{IPA|[dɛ fənɛtʁə'''z'''‿uvɛʁt]}} (&quot;open windows&quot;). In common speech this is almost never done, so singular and plural forms of most nouns are homophonous in all contexts.

However, some French nouns have distinguishable spoken plural forms. This includes most of those ending in ''-al'', whose plural form is ''-aux'' (cf. ''cheval'' {{IPA|[ʃəval]}} &gt; ''chevaux'' {{IPA|[ʃəvo]}} 'horses'), as well as a few nouns ending in ''-ail'' which also follow this pattern (cf. ''travail'' [tʁavaj] &gt; ''travaux'' [tʁavo] 'works'). Three nouns form completely irregular plurals: ''aïeul'' [ajœl] &gt; ''aïeux'' [ajø] 'ancestors' (but ''aïeuls'' [ajœl] 'grandfathers'); ''ciel'' [sjɛl] &gt; ''cieux'' [sjø] 'heavens' (but ''des ciels de lit'' 'bed canopies'); and ''œil'' [œj] &gt; ''yeux'' [jø] 'eyes' (but ''des œils-de-bœuf'' 'oculi' (round windows), ''des œils-de-perdrix'' 'calluses' (on the feet)). Three other nouns have regular plurals in spelling but have irregular pronunciations: ''bœuf'' {{IPA|[bœf]}} &gt; ''bœufs'' {{IPA|[bø]}} 'oxen, cattle'; ''œuf'' {{IPA|[œf]}} &gt; ''œufs'' {{IPA|[ø]}} 'eggs'; and ''os'' {{IPA|[ɔs]}} &gt; ''os'' {{IPA|[o]}} 'bones'.

As with English, most uncountable nouns are grammatically treated as singular, though some are plural, such as ''les mathématiques'' 'mathematics'; some nouns that are uncountable in English are countable in French, such as ''une information'' 'a piece of information'.

=== Case ===
Nouns in French are not inflected for any other grammatical categories. (However, personal pronouns are inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical person|person]]; see [[#Pronouns|below]].)

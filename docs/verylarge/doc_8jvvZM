===Literary works===
According to Banhatti, &quot;[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist&quot;,{{Sfn|Banhatti|1963|p=273}} composing many songs and poems, including his favourite,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} &quot;[[Kali the Mother (poem)|Kali the Mother]]&quot;. Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

''[[Bartaman Bharat]]'' meaning &quot;Present Day India&quot;{{sfn|Mittra|2001|p=88}} is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him, which was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth volume of ''The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda''.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=118}} In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every [[India]]n as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=465}}

== Life ==

===Early life===
Born on 1 September 1896, the day after [[Janmastami]](the birth date of lord krishna), one of the most important  [[Hindu festivals|festivals]], in a humble house in Calcutta to a Bengali [[Kayastha]] family,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvml.org/contemporary/sankarsan.html|title=Interview with Srila Prabhupada's Grand-Nephew - Sankarsan Prabhu|website=bvml.org|access-date=11 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727173533/http://bvml.org/contemporary/sankarsan.html|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was named Abhay Charan, &quot;''one who is fearless'', ''having taken shelter at Lord [[Krishna]]'s feet''.&quot; Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava (&quot;the celebration of [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]],&quot; Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honour of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulāl. His parents, &quot;Sriman&quot; Gour Mohan De and &quot;Srimati&quot; Rajani De, were devout [[Vaishnava]]s (devotees of [[Vishnu]]). In accordance with [[Bengali people|Bengali]] tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the birth, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home at 6 Sitakanta Banerjee Lane, Kolkata.&lt;ref name = &quot;SDG2&quot;/&gt;

He received a European-style education at the [[Scottish Church College]], which was well regarded among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wikipedia|first=Source|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULdOngEACAAJ|title=Scottish Church College, Calcutta Alumni: A.

In the college, Abhay Charan De (অভয়চরণ দে) was a member of the English Society as well as that of the [[Sanskrit]] Society, and it has been suggested that his education provided him with a foundation for his future leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasan&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vasan|Lewis|2005|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, D. 1989. ''Encyclopedia of World Biography: A to F''.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 22 years old, he married Radharani Devi, who was then 11 years old, in a [[arranged marriage|marriage arranged]] by their parents.

So one day he decided to renunciate the household and dedicated his life for humanity.

===Religious journey===
[[File:Bhaktisiddhanta.jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]]]]
{{Vaishnavism}}
In 1922, when he first met his [[parampara|spiritual master]], [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]], he was requested to spread the message of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] in the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDGPRA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he became a formally initiated disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta. In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called ''[[Back to Godhead]]'',&lt;ref name = hk34/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDGPRA1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|1984|loc=page xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo, an effulgent figure of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the upper left corner, with the motto: &quot;''Godhead is Light, Nescience is darkness''&quot; greeting the readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol. 1 Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first magazine he wrote:

{{quote|Under the circumstances since 1936 up to now, I was simply speculating whether I shall venture this difficult task and that without any means and capacity; but as none have discouraged me, I have now taken courage to take up the work.|A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami|Back to Godhead magazine (Vol. 1, 1–4, 1944)&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG5&quot; /&gt;}}

In 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society recognised his scholarship with the title ''Bhaktivedanta,'' (''{{IAST|bhakti-vedānta}}'') meaning &quot;one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ssr&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhaktivedanta|2003|loc=Ending Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the words [[Bhakti]], indicating devotion and [[Vedanta]] indicating conclusive knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;A.

Bhaktivedanta Swami, [[Satsvarupa dasa Goswami]] (1998) ''The secrets of transcendental love'', {{ISBN|0-89213-273-6}}, p. 73: &quot;The spiritual harmony of knowledge and devotion is well expressed in the phrase ''bhakti-vedānta''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

His later well known name, ''{{IAST|Prabhupāda}}'', is a [[Sanskrit]] title, literally meaning &quot;he who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord&quot; where'' {{IAST|prabhu}}'' denotes &quot;Lord&quot;, and ''{{IAST|pāda}}'' means &quot;taking shelter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aparna Chattopadhyay |title=Pearls of Spiritual Wisdom |publisher=Pustak Mahal, India |location= |year=2004 |page=37 |isbn=81-223-0858-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, &quot;''at whose feet masters sit''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodes&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rhodes|2001|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was used as a respectful form of address by his disciples from late 1967/early 1968 onwards. Previous to this, as with his early disciples, followers had called him &quot;[[Swami]]ji&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDGp&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter ''Planting the seed''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar [[mandir]] in the holy town of [[Vrindavan]], where he began his commentary and translation work of the [[Sanskrit]] work [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles S.

===Renunciation===
The [[Gaudiya Matha]] at [[Prayagraj]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] was where he lived, wrote and studied, edited the ''{{IAST|Gauḍīya Patrikā}}'' magazine and where he donated the deity of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] which stands on the altar beside those of [[Radha Krishna]] (named ''Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vinodavihārījī''). During his visit in September 1959 he entered the doors of this ''[[Gaudiya Matha|matha]]'' dressed in white, as Abhoy Babu, but he left dressed in saffron, as a Vaishnava renunciate (''[[sannyasa|sannyasi]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol.1 Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his renunciate vows from his friend and godbrother [[Bhakti Prajnana Keshava]]. On becoming a sannyasa he also took the prenominal ''[[Swami]]'' (स्वामी Svāmī). He single-handedly published the seventeen chapter first book of ''Bhagavata Purana'', filling three volumes of four hundred pages each, enriched with a detailed commentary. The introduction to the first volume was a biographical sketch of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDGm&quot; /&gt; He then left India, obtaining free passage on a Scindia Line freighter named ''Jaladuta'', with the aim and hope of fulfilling his spiritual master's instruction to spread the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of [[Indian rupee|Indian currency]], and several boxes of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=&quot;Bhaktivedanta Swami, by journeying to America, was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of his dear Lord Krishna.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission to the West===
{{main|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}In 1936, just days before [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura|Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]]'s death, Prabhupada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.srilaprabhupadalila.org/who-is-srila-prabhupada|title=Srila Prabhupada Lila|website=www.srilaprabhupadalila.org|access-date=2020-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was specifically ordered to spread Krishna consciousness in the English language to the West. He did not take the mission given to him by his spiritual master with the utmost seriousness until he was reading a Bhagavad-gita commentary written by Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur, who was the father of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. [[File:Prabhupadai-handwrite.jpg|left|thumb|274x274px|A message from ''Jaladuta Diary'' Journal kept by Prabhupada. Between 25 August 1965 and 30 August 1965, the ''Jaladuta'' Journal falls silent for six days. On the seventh day, 31 August, the silence is broken with these simple words, &quot;Passed over a great crisis on the struggle for life and death.&quot;]]

When he sailed to the United States in 1965, his trip was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;char&quot; /&gt; As the Indian freighter ''Jaladuta'' neared his destination, the magnitude of his intended task weighed on him. On 13 September he wrote in his diary, &quot;Today I have disclosed my mind to my companion, Lord Sri [[Krishna]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goswami|2002|loc=Vol 1. Ch 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion and on a number of others, he called on Krishna for help in his native [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Examining these compositions, academics regard them as &quot;intimate records of his prayerful preparation for what lay ahead&quot; and a view on &quot;how Bhaktivedanta Swami understood his own identity and mission.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knot22&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|1997|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|I do not know why You have brought me here. Now You can do whatever You like with me. But I guess You have some business here, otherwise why would You bring me to this terrible place? How will I make them understand this message of Krishna consciousness? I am very unfortunate, unqualified and most fallen. Therefore I am seeking Your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDG11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knot22&quot; /&gt;}}
By journeying to the United States, he was attempting to fulfil the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of &quot;his dear Lord Krishna&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knot22&quot; /&gt; It was in July 1966 that he brought &quot;global missionary Vaishnavism&quot; to the [[Western world]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Srivatsa&quot; /&gt; founding the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) in [[New York City]]. He spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution. Since he was the Society's leader, his personality and his management capabilities were responsible for much of ISKCON's growth and the reach of his mission.

When it was suggested to him at the time of founding the ISKCON in 1966 that a broader term &quot;God Consciousness&quot; would be preferable to &quot;Krishna Consciousness&quot; in the title, he rejected this recommendation, suggesting that the name ''Krishna'' includes all other forms and concepts of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;ex122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekstrand|Bryant|2004|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a group of devotees and a temple had been established in [[New York City|New York]], another centre was started in [[San Francisco]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he travelled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (''[[sankirtana]]''), book distribution and public speeches.

[[File:Krishna Balarama12.jpg|thumb|One of 108 worldwide temples he opened by 1977, was dedicated to [[Krishna]]-[[Balarama]] (pictured above) in [[Vrindavana]], India]]

Once ISKCON was more established in San Francisco, a small number of devotees from the [[San Francisco]] temple were sent to [[London]], England where they came into contact with [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] took the greatest interest, spending a significant amount of time speaking with him and producing a record with members of what became the London [[Radha Krsna Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years his continuing leadership role took him around the world several times setting up temples and communities on other continents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and modernity|publisher=Blackwell Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-631-20862-3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=178|author=Smith, David Nichol}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in [[Vrindavan]] in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasan&quot; /&gt;

Through his mission, he followed and communicated the teachings of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] and introduced [[bhakti yoga]] to an international audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;translation&quot; /&gt; Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism this was viewed as the fulfilment of a long time mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html#BranchesGM |title=Branches of the Gaudiya Math |publisher=www.vrindavan.org |accessdate=30 May 2008 |last=Maharaja |first=Sridhar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704175744/http://www.vrindavan.org/English/Books/GM/GMII.html#BranchesGM |archivedate=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 81, Bhaktivedanta Swami passed away on 14 November 1977 in Vrindavan, India, and his body was buried in [[Krishna Balaram Mandir]] in Vrindavan.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifespan&quot;/&gt;

==In India==
[[File:Iskcon Delhi Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[ISKCON Temple Delhi|ISKCON Temple in Delhi]], India]]Beginning his public preaching mission in India, he founded the League of Devotees in [[Jhansi]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prabhupadaconnect.com/League_of_Devotees.html League of Devotees article] prabhupadaconnect.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of temples and centers in the United States and Europe, he returned to India in 1971, holding many public programs which were well attended. From 1971 onwards, the movement became increasingly popular and spread throughout India. He was particularly eager to see the progress on &quot;the impressive temple project in&quot; [[Mumbai]] which he and his disciples had fought with determination to establish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Dwayer|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with large temples in [[Mayapur]] and [[Vrindavan]] to follow in the mid-1970s. To promote the vedic education system within the modern Indian education structure, he introduced a chain of [[Gurukul]] in various part of India. The [[ISKCON schools#Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School|Bhaktivedanta Gurukula and International School]] is one of the most successful schools in the list.

In 1996, the [[Government of India]] recognized his accomplishments by issuing a commemorative stamp in his honour as a part of Prabhupada Centennial celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;

Speaking at the inauguration of ISKCON's cultural center in New Delhi on the occasion of Ramnavmi in 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], then newly elected Prime Minister of India, said:

{{quote|If today the Bhagavad Gita is printed in millions of copies in scores of Indian languages and distributed in all nooks and corners of the world, the credit for this great sacred service goes chiefly to ISKCON.&amp;nbsp;...

For this one accomplishment alone, Indians should be eternally grateful to the devoted spiritual army of Swami Prabhupada's followers. The voyage of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to the United States in 1965 and the spectacular popularity his movement gained in a very short spell of twelve years must be regarded as one of the greatest spiritual events of the century.|Atal Bihari Vajpayee – 5 April 1998

Srila Prabhupada also dreamed of building a Vedic Planetarium Temple that would show the creation of the universe according to the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', for which he asked his disciple [[Alfred Ford]] ({{aka}} Ambarish Das) to help. This temple is being built in Mayapur.

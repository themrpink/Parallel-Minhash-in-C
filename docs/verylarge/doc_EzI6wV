While Merced has historically had a proportionally large portion of Hmong (in 1997, 12,000 of Merced's 61,000 residents were Hmong&lt;ref name=&quot;Fadiman1997&quot;/&gt;), demographic shifts have reduced this. The [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996 prompted a move of some Hmong to [[Minnesota]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Wisconsin]].

In 2010, [[Latinos]] became a majority population in Merced and [[Merced County]] as the agricultural industry brought in migrant farm laborers.

'''Cecil Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Richardson''' (5 June 1928 â€“ 14 November 1991) was an English filmmaker. He won two [[Academy Awards]] for directing and producing the comedy film ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' (1963).

== Early life ==
Richardson was born in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1928, the son of Elsie Evans (Campion) and Clarence Albert Richardson, a chemist.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp 1â€“5&lt;/ref&gt; He was Head Boy at [[Ashville College]], [[Harrogate]] and attended [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. His Oxford contemporaries included [[Rupert Murdoch]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Kenneth Tynan]], [[Lindsay Anderson]] and [[Gavin Lambert]]. He had the unprecedented distinction of being the President of both the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and the Experimental Theatre Club (the ETC), in addition to being the theatre critic for the university magazine ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Those he cast in his student productions included [[Shirley Williams]] (as Cordelia), [[John Schlesinger]], [[Nigel Davenport]] and [[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Adler, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Tony Richardson's house.jpg|thumb|Oscar winning film maker Tony Richardson's house from 1928 to 1948, 28 Bingley Road, Saltaire, Shipley.|Richardson's house from 1928 to 1948, 28 Bingley Road, Saltaire, Shipley]]
In 1955, in his directing debut,&lt;ref&gt;David Parkinson, 'Richardson, Cecil Antonio [Tony] (1928â€“1991)', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson produced [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s ''[[The Apollo of Bellac]]'' for television with [[Denholm Elliott]] and [[Natasha Parry]] in the main roles.&lt;ref name=times&gt;&quot;Giraudoux Play on Television 'The Apollo of Bellac'&quot;, ''[[The Times]]'', 13 August 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time he began to be active in Britain's [[Free Cinema]] movement, co-directing the non-fiction short ''[[Momma Don't Allow]]'' (also 1955) with [[Karel Reisz]].

Part of the [[British New Wave|British &quot;New Wave&quot;]] of directors, he was involved in the formation of the English Stage Company, along with his close friend George Goetschius and [[George Devine]]. He directed [[John Osborne]]'s play ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], and in the same period he directed Shakespeare in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. Then in 1957 he directed [[Laurence Olivier]] as Archie Rice in Osborne's next play ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', again for the Royal Court.

In 1959, Richardson co-founded [[Woodfall Film Productions]] with [[John Osborne]] and producer [[Harry Saltzman]], and, as Woodfall's debut, directed the film version of ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), his first feature film.

Many of Richardson's films, such as ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' and ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', were part of the acclaimed [[kitchen sink realism]] movement popular in Britain at the time, and several of his films continue to be held as cornerstones of the movement. In 1964 Richardson received two [[Academy Awards]] (Best Director and Best Picture) for ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' (1963) based on the novel by [[Henry Fielding]]. His next film was ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'' (1965), during which he worked with established stars including [[John Gielgud]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Robert Morse]] working in Hollywood both on location and on the [[sound stage]]. In his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; he confesses that he did not share the general admiration of [[Haskell Wexler]], who worked on ''The Loved One'' as both [[director of photography]] and a producer.

Among stars that Richardson directed were: [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Trevor Howard]], [[David Hemmings]], [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Tom Courtenay]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Richard Burton]],&lt;ref&gt;Until dismissed by Richardson for repeatedly failing to show up on set as contracted (Richardson, pp. 212â€“3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jodie Foster]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Seth Green]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Paul Scofield]] and [[Judi Dench]]. His musical composers included [[Antoine Duhamel]], [[John Addison]] and [[Shel Silverstein]]. His screenwriters were [[Jean Genet]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Terry Southern]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Edward Bond]] (adapting [[Vladimir Nabokov]]) and [[Edward Albee]]. Richardson and Osborne eventually fell out&lt;ref&gt;Heilpern, pp.346â€“51&lt;/ref&gt; during production of the film ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1968). The basic issue was Osborne's unwillingness to go through the rewrite process, more arduous in film than it is in the theatre. Richardson himself had a different version. In his autobiography (p.&amp;nbsp;195) he writes that Osborne was angry at being replaced, in a small rÃ´le, by [[Laurence Harvey]] to whom the producers had obligations. Osborne took literary revenge by creating a fictionalised and pseudonymous Richardson â€“ a domineering and arrogant character whom everyone hated â€“ in his play ''The Hotel in Amsterdam''.

Richardson's work was stylistically varied. ''[[Mademoiselle (1966 film)|Mademoiselle]]'' (1966) was shot ''noir''-style on location in rural France with a static camera, [[Black and white#Media|monochrome film stock]] and no music. ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1968) was part epic and part animated feature. ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970) was what might be called an Aussie-western. ''[[Laughter in the Dark (film)|Laughter in the Dark]]'' (1969) and ''[[A Delicate Balance (film)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1973) were psycho-dramas. ''[[Joseph Andrews (film)|Joseph Andrews]]'' (1977), based on another novel by Henry Fielding, was a return to the mood of ''Tom Jones''.

In 1970, Richardson was set to direct a film about [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] with a script by Edward Albee. It was to have starred [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as Nijinsky, [[Claude Jade]] as Romola and Paul Scofield as Diaghilev, but producer Harry Saltzman cancelled the project during pre-production.

In 1974, he travelled to Los Angeles to work on a script (never produced) with [[Sam Shepard]], and took up residence there.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he began work on ''[[Mahogany (1975 film)|Mahogany]]'' (1975), starring [[Diana Ross]], but was fired by [[Motown]] head [[Berry Gordy]] shortly after production began, owing to creative differences.

He wrote and directed the [[comedy-drama]] ''[[The Hotel New Hampshire (film)|The Hotel New Hampshire]]'' (1984) based on [[John Irving]]'s [[The Hotel New Hampshire|novel of the same name]] and starring Jodie Foster, [[Beau Bridges]] and Rob Lowe. Although it was a box-office failure, the film received a positive critical reception.

Richardson made four more major films before his death. His last, ''[[Blue Sky (1994 film)|Blue Sky]]'' (1994), was not released for nearly three years after he died. [[Jessica Lange]] won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance.

In 1966, Richardson financed the escape from [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs prison]] of the spy and [[double agent]] [[George Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10116541/John-Quine.html |title=John Quine |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=12 June 2013 |access-date=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Richardson was married to English actress [[Vanessa Redgrave]] from 1962 to 1967. The couple had two daughters, [[Natasha Richardson|Natasha]] (1963â€“2009) and [[Joely Richardson]] (born 1965), before he left Redgrave for French actress and singer [[Jeanne Moreau]]. In 1972, he also had a relationship with Grizelda Grimond, who was a secretary for Richardson's former business partner [[Oscar Lewenstein]], and daughter of British politician [[Jo Grimond]]. Grizelda gave birth to his daughter, Katharine Grimond, on 8 January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p.233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Richardson was [[bisexual]], but never acknowledged it publicly until after he contracted [[HIV]]. He died of complications from [[AIDS]] in 1991.

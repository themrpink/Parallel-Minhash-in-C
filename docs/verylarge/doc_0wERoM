The phrase &quot;metal–oxide–semiconductor&quot; is a reference to the physical structure of MOS [[field-effect transistor]]s, having a [[metal gate]] electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a [[semiconductor|semiconductor material]]. [[Aluminium]] was once used but now the material is [[polysilicon]]. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of [[high-κ dielectric]] materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the [[45 nanometer]] node and smaller sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/45nm/index.htm|title=Intel® Architecture Leads the Microarchitecture Innovation Field|website=Intel|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140302/http://www.intel.com/technology/45nm/index.htm|archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;CMOS&quot; refers to both a particular style of digital circuitry design and the family of processes used to implement that circuitry on integrated circuits (chips). CMOS circuitry dissipates [[Low-power electronics|less power]] than [[logic family|logic families]] with resistive loads. Since this advantage has increased and grown more important, CMOS processes and variants have come to dominate, thus the vast majority of modern integrated circuit manufacturing is on CMOS processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=CMOS: circuit design, layout, and simulation |last=Baker |first=R.

CMOS circuits use a combination of p-type and n-type [[MOSFET|metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFETs) to implement [[logic gate]]s and other digital circuits. Although CMOS logic can be implemented with discrete devices for demonstrations, commercial CMOS products are integrated circuits composed of up to billions of transistors of both types, on a rectangular piece of [[silicon]] of between 10 and 400&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

CMOS always uses all [[enhancement-mode]] MOSFETs (in other words, a zero gate-to-source voltage turns the transistor off).

{{See|MOSFET|Transistor density}}

The principle of complementary symmetry was first introduced by [[George Clifford Sziklai|George Sziklai]] in 1953 who then discussed several complementary bipolar circuits. [[Paul K. Weimer|Paul Weimer]], also at [[RCA]], invented in 1962 [[thin-film transistor|TFT]] complementary circuits, a close relative of CMOS. He invented complementary [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] and inverter circuits, but did no work in a more complex complementary logic. He was the first person able to put p-channel and n-channel TFTs in a circuit on the same substrate. Three years earlier, [[J. Torkel Wallmark|John T. Wallmark]] and Sanford M. Marcus published a variety of complex logic functions implemented as integrated circuits using [[JFET]]s, including complementary memory circuits. Frank Wanlass was familiar with work done by Weimer at RCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=George Clifford |first1=Sziklai |title=Symmetrical Properties of Transistors and Their Applications |date=1953 | volume=41 | issue=6 | pages=717–724 | publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3540342588 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author

The [[MOSFET]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959. There were originally two types of MOSFET [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]], [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] ([[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] MOS) and [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] ([[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] MOS).&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal-oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/|title=1960: Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Transistor Demonstrated|journal=The Silicon Engine: A Timeline of Semiconductors in Computers|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types were developed by Atalla and Kahng when they originally invented the MOSFET, fabricating both PMOS and NMOS devices with [[20 µm process|20&amp;nbsp;µm]] and then [[10 µm process|10&amp;nbsp;µm]] gate lengths in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lojek&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=321–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voinigescu |first1=Sorin |title=High-Frequency Integrated Circuits |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521873024 |page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71dHe1yb9jgC&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the MOSFET was initially overlooked and ignored by Bell Labs in favour of [[bipolar transistors]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lojek&quot;/&gt; the MOSFET invention generated significant interest at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;/&gt; Based on Atalla's work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sah&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sah |first=Chih-Tang |author-link=Chih-Tang Sah |title=Evolution of the MOS transistor-from conception to VLSI |journal=[[Proceedings of the IEEE]] |date=October 1988 |volume=76 |issue=10 |pages=1280–1326 (1290) |doi=10.1109/5.16328 |bibcode=1988IEEEP..76.1280S |url=http://www.dejazzer.com/ece723/resources/Evolution_of_the_MOS_transistor.pdf |issn=0018-9219 |quote=Those of us active in silicon material and device research during 1956{{ndash}}1960 considered this successful effort by the Bell Labs group led by Atalla to stabilize the silicon surface the most important and significant technology advance, which blazed the trail that led to silicon integrated circuit technology developments in the second phase and volume production in the third phase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chih-Tang Sah]] introduced MOS technology to Fairchild with his MOS-controlled [[tetrode]] fabricated in late 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;/&gt;

CMOS was commercialised by [[RCA]] in the late 1960s. RCA adopted CMOS for the design of [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), developing CMOS circuits for an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] computer in 1965 and then a 288-[[bit]] CMOS [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] memory chip in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory1963&quot;/&gt; RCA also used CMOS for its [[4000-series integrated circuits]] in 1968, starting with a 20{{nbsp}}[[μm]] [[semiconductor manufacturing process]] before gradually scaling to a [[10&amp;nbsp;μm process]] over the next several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lojek330&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cu1Oh_COv8C&amp;pg=PA330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMOS technology was initially overlooked by the American [[semiconductor industry]] in favour of NMOS, which was more powerful at the time.

== Inversion ==
CMOS circuits are constructed in such a way that all [[PMOS logic|P-type metal–oxide–semiconductor]] (PMOS) transistors must have either an input from the voltage source or from another PMOS transistor. Similarly, all [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] transistors must have either an input from ground or from another NMOS transistor. The composition of a PMOS transistor creates low [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] between its source and drain contacts when a low gate [[voltage]] is applied and high resistance when a high gate voltage is applied. On the other hand, the composition of an NMOS transistor creates high resistance between source and drain when a low gate voltage is applied and low resistance when a high gate voltage is applied. CMOS accomplishes current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct, while a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation. However, during the switching time, both MOSFETs conduct briefly as the gate voltage goes from one state to another. This induces a brief spike in power consumption and becomes a serious issue at high frequencies.

[[File:CMOS Inverter.svg|thumb|Static CMOS inverter. '''V&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;''' are standing for [[IC power-supply pin|drain and source]] respectively.]]
The adjacent image shows what happens when an input is connected to both a PMOS transistor (top of diagram) and an NMOS transistor (bottom of diagram). When the voltage of input A is low, the NMOS transistor's channel is in a high resistance state. This limits the current that can flow from Q to ground. The PMOS transistor's channel is in a low resistance state and much more current can flow from the supply to the output. Because the resistance between the supply voltage and Q is low, the voltage drop between the supply voltage and Q due to a current drawn from Q is small. The output, therefore, registers a high voltage.

On the other hand, when the voltage of input A is high, the PMOS transistor is in an OFF (high resistance) state so it would limit the current flowing from the positive supply to the output, while the NMOS transistor is in an ON (low resistance) state, allowing the output from drain to ground. Because the resistance between Q and ground is low, the voltage drop due to a current drawn into Q placing Q above ground is small. This low drop results in the output registering a low voltage.

In short, the outputs of the PMOS and NMOS transistors are complementary such that when the input is low, the output is high, and when the input is high, the output is low. Because of this behavior of input and output, the CMOS circuit's output is the inverse of the input.

=== Power supply pins ===

The power supply pins for CMOS are called V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt;, or V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and Ground(GND) depending on the manufacturer. V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt; are carryovers from conventional MOS circuits and stand for the ''drain'' and ''source'' supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-77.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209004748/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-77.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not apply directly to CMOS, since both supplies are really source supplies. V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and Ground are carryovers from [[TTL logic]] and that nomenclature has been retained with the introduction of the 54C/74C line of CMOS.

=== Duality ===
An important characteristic of a CMOS circuit is the duality that exists between its PMOS transistors and NMOS transistors. A CMOS circuit is created to allow a path always to exist from the output to either the power source or ground. To accomplish this, the set of all paths to the voltage source must be the [[Complement (set theory)#Logical complement|complement]] of the set of all paths to ground. This can be easily accomplished by defining one in terms of the NOT of the other. Due to the [[De Morgan's laws]] based logic, the PMOS transistors in parallel have corresponding NMOS transistors in series while the PMOS transistors in series have corresponding NMOS transistors in parallel.

=== Logic ===
[[File:CMOS NAND.svg|thumb|upright|[[NAND gate]] in CMOS logic]]

More complex logic functions such as those involving [[AND gate|AND]] and [[OR gate]]s require manipulating the paths between gates to represent the logic. When a path consists of two transistors in series, both transistors must have low resistance to the corresponding supply voltage, modelling an AND. When a path consists of two transistors in parallel, either one or both of the transistors must have low resistance to connect the supply voltage to the output, modelling an OR.

Shown on the right is a [[circuit diagram]] of a [[NAND gate]] in CMOS logic. If both of the A and B inputs are high, then both the NMOS transistors (bottom half of the diagram) will conduct, neither of the PMOS transistors (top half) will conduct, and a conductive path will be established between the output and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; (ground), bringing the output low. If both of the A and B inputs are low, then neither of the NMOS transistors will conduct, while both of the PMOS transistors will conduct, establishing a conductive path between the output and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; (voltage source), bringing the output high.  If either of the A or B inputs is low, one of the NMOS transistors will not conduct, one of the PMOS transistors will, and a conductive path will be established between the output and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; (voltage source), bringing the output high.  As the only configuration of the two inputs that results in a low output is when both are high, this circuit implements a [[NAND gate|NAND]] (NOT AND) logic gate.

An advantage of CMOS over NMOS logic is that both low-to-high and high-to-low output transitions are fast since the (PMOS) pull-up transistors have low resistance when switched on, unlike the load resistors in NMOS logic. In addition, the output signal swings the full [[voltage]] between the low and high rails. This strong, more nearly symmetric response also makes CMOS more resistant to noise.

=== Example: NAND gate in physical layout ===
[[File:CMOS NAND Layout.svg|thumb|upright|The [[physical layout]] of a NAND circuit. The larger regions of N-type diffusion and P-type diffusion are part of the transistors. The two smaller regions on the left are taps to prevent [[latchup]]. ]]
[[File:CMOS fabrication process.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified process of fabrication of a CMOS inverter on p-type substrate in semiconductor microfabrication. In step 1, [[silicon dioxide]] layers are formed initially through [[thermal oxidation]] Note: Gate, source and drain contacts are not normally in the same plane in real devices, and the diagram is not to scale.]]

This example shows a [[Logical NAND|NAND]] logic device drawn as a physical representation as it would be manufactured. The physical layout perspective is a &quot;bird's eye view&quot; of a stack of layers. The circuit is constructed on a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|P-type]] substrate. The [[polysilicon]], diffusion, and n-well are referred to as &quot;base layers&quot; and are actually inserted into trenches of the P-type substrate. (See steps 1 to 6 in the process diagram below right) The contacts penetrate an insulating layer between the base layers and the first layer of metal (metal1) making a connection.

The inputs to the [[NAND gate|NAND]] (illustrated in green color) are in polysilicon. The transistors (devices) are formed by the intersection of the polysilicon and diffusion; N diffusion for the N device &amp; P diffusion for the P device (illustrated in salmon and yellow coloring respectively). The output (&quot;out&quot;) is connected together in metal (illustrated in cyan coloring). Connections between metal and polysilicon or diffusion are made through contacts (illustrated as black squares). The [[physical layout]] example matches the NAND logic circuit given in the previous example.

The N device is manufactured on a P-type substrate while the P device is manufactured in an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|N-type]] well (n-well). A P-type substrate &quot;tap&quot; is connected to V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt; and an N-type n-well tap is connected to V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; to prevent [[latchup]].

== Power: switching and leakage ==
CMOS logic dissipates less power than NMOS logic circuits because CMOS dissipates power only when switching (&quot;dynamic power&quot;). On a typical [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] in a modern [[90 nanometer]] process, switching the output might take 120 picoseconds, and happens once every ten nanoseconds. NMOS logic dissipates power whenever the transistor is on, because there is a current path from V&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; through the load resistor and the n-type network.

Static CMOS gates are very power efficient because they dissipate nearly zero power when idle. Earlier, the power consumption of CMOS devices was not the major concern while designing chips. Factors like speed and area dominated the design parameters. As the CMOS technology moved below sub-micron levels the power consumption per unit area of the chip has risen tremendously.

Broadly classifying, power dissipation in CMOS circuits occurs because of two components, static and dynamic:

=== Static dissipation ===

Both NMOS and PMOS transistors have a gate–source [[threshold voltage]], below which the current (called ''sub threshold'' current) through the device drops exponentially. Historically, CMOS designs operated at supply voltages much larger than their threshold voltages (V&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; might have been 5&amp;nbsp;V, and V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; for both NMOS and PMOS might have been 700&amp;nbsp;mV). A special type of the transistor used in some CMOS circuits is the [[native transistor]], with near zero [[threshold voltage]].

SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a good insulator, but at very small thickness levels electrons can tunnel across the very thin insulation; the probability drops off exponentially with oxide thickness. Tunnelling current becomes very important for transistors below 130&amp;nbsp;nm technology with gate oxides of 20&amp;nbsp;Å or thinner.

Small reverse leakage currents are formed due to formation of reverse bias between diffusion regions and wells (for e.g., p-type diffusion vs. n-well), wells and substrate (for e.g., n-well vs. p-substrate). In modern process diode leakage is very small compared to sub threshold and tunnelling currents, so these may be neglected during power calculations.

If the ratios do not match, then there might be different currents of PMOS and NMOS; this may lead to imbalance and thus improper current causes the CMOS to heat up and dissipate power unnecessarily. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that leakage power reduces due to aging effects as a trade-off for devices to become slower. &lt;ref&gt;A. L. H. Martínez, S. Khursheed and D. Rossi, &quot;Leveraging CMOS Aging for Efficient Microelectronics Design,&quot; 2020 IEEE 26th International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9159742 ieeexplore]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dynamic dissipation ===

==== Charging and discharging of load capacitances ====
CMOS circuits dissipate power by charging the various load capacitances (mostly gate and wire capacitance, but also drain and some source capacitances) whenever they are switched. In one complete cycle of CMOS logic, current flows from V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; to the load capacitance to charge it and then flows from the charged load capacitance (C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) to ground during discharge. Therefore, in one complete charge/discharge cycle, a total of Q=C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; is thus transferred from V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; to ground. Multiply by the switching frequency on the load capacitances to get the current used, and multiply by the average voltage again to get the characteristic switching power dissipated by a CMOS device: &lt;math&gt; P = 0.5 C V^2 f &lt;/math&gt;.

Since most gates do not operate/switch at every [[Clock signal|clock cycle]], they are often accompanied by a factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, called the activity factor. Now, the dynamic power dissipation may be re-written as &lt;math&gt; P = \alpha C V^2 f &lt;/math&gt;.

A clock in a system has an activity factor α=1, since it rises and falls every cycle. Most data has an activity factor of 0.1.&lt;ref&gt;K. Moiseev, A. Kolodny and S. Wimer, &quot;Timing-aware power-optimal ordering of signals&quot;, ''ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems'', Volume 13 Issue 4, September 2008, [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]&lt;/ref&gt; If correct load capacitance is estimated on a node together with its activity factor, the dynamic power dissipation at that node can be calculated effectively.

Since there is a finite rise/fall time for both pMOS and nMOS, during transition, for example, from off to on, both the transistors will be on for a small period of time in which current will find a path directly from V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; to ground, hence creating a [[short-circuit current]]. Short-circuit power dissipation increases with rise and fall time of the transistors.

An additional form of power consumption became significant in the 1990s as wires on chip became narrower and the long wires became more resistive. CMOS gates at the end of those resistive wires see slow input transitions. During the middle of these transitions, both the NMOS and PMOS logic networks are partially conductive, and current flows directly from V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt;. The power thus used is called ''crowbar'' power. Careful design which avoids weakly driven long skinny wires ameliorates this effect, but crowbar power can be a substantial part of dynamic CMOS power.

To speed up designs, manufacturers have switched to constructions that have lower voltage thresholds but because of this a modern NMOS transistor with a V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; of 200&amp;nbsp;mV has a significant [[subthreshold leakage]] current. Designs (e.g. desktop processors) which include vast numbers of circuits which are not actively switching still consume power because of this leakage current. Leakage power is a significant portion of the total power consumed by such designs. [[Multi-threshold CMOS]] (MTCMOS), now available from foundries, is one approach to managing leakage power. With MTCMOS, high V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; transistors are used when switching speed is not critical, while low V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; transistors are used in speed sensitive paths. Further technology advances that use even thinner gate dielectrics have an additional [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage]] component because of current [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]] through the extremely thin gate dielectric. Using [[high-κ dielectric]]s instead of [[silicon dioxide]] that is the conventional gate dielectric allows similar device performance, but with a thicker gate insulator, thus avoiding this current. Leakage power reduction using new material and system designs is critical to sustaining scaling of CMOS.&lt;ref&gt;A good overview of leakage and reduction methods are explained in the book [https://www.springer.com/engineering/circuits+%26+systems/book/978-0-387-25737-2 Leakage in Nanometer CMOS Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202012235/http://www.springer.com/engineering/circuits+%26+systems/book/978-0-387-25737-2 |date=2011-12-02 }} {{ISBN|0-387-25737-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Input protection ==
Parasitic transistors that are inherent in the CMOS structure may be turned on by input signals outside the normal operating range, e.g. [[electrostatic discharge]]s or [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|line reflections]]. The resulting [[latch-up]] may damage or destroy the CMOS device. Clamp diodes are included in CMOS circuits to deal with these signals. Manufacturers' data sheets specify the maximum permitted current that may flow through the diodes.

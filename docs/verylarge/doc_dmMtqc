Upon the death of the third Earl, the earldom was inherited by the first Earl's younger son [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]], who is now remembered for his many thousands of insightful letters, published in 48 volumes by [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;W.H.

==Legacy==
[[File:Walpole's reign2.jpg|thumb|''Walpole's reign'' – political satire]]

Walpole exercised a tremendous influence on the politics of his day. The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Walpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]]. Later in the century, the Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] &quot;admitted him into the whig pantheon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=Taylor |first=Stephen |id=28601 |title=Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676–1745) |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote:

{{quote|He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether &quot;an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both&quot;.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was &quot;much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life&quot;:

{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114–115}} }}

[[10 Downing Street]] represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Walpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers. As a result, the industry became Britain's primary export, enabling the country to import the raw materials and food that fueled the industrial revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism|url=https://archive.org/details/thingstheydontte00chan_740|url-access=limited|author=Ha-Joon Chang|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/thingstheydontte00chan_740/page/n285 70]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole is immortalised in [[St Stephen's Hall]], where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.&lt;ref name=ssstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/architecture/palace-s-interiors/st-stephen-s-hall/|title=St Stephen's Hall|website=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole built [[Houghton Hall]] in Norfolk as his country seat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Walpole also left behind a [[Walpole collection|collection of art]] which he had assembled during his career. His grandson, [[George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford|the 3rd Earl of Orford]], sold many of the works in this collection to the Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] in 1779. This collection—then regarded as one of the finest in Europe&lt;ref&gt;''Art Sales: A History of Sales of Pictures and Other Works of Art'', by George Redford, 1888, London, p. 356–57, &quot;Sale of the Houghton Gallery.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;—now lies in the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. In 2013 the Hermitage loaned the collection to Houghton for display following the original William Kent hanging plan, recently discovered at Houghton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/events/houghton-revisited/|title=Houghton Revisited {{!}} Special Exhibition {{!}} Christie's|last=Christie's|website=www.christies.com|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nursery rhyme &quot;[[Cock Robin|Who Killed Cock Robin]]?&quot; may allude to the fall of Walpole, who carried the popular nickname &quot;Cock Robin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Opie |first1=Iona Archibald |last2=Opie |first2=Peter |year=1997

In the United States, the towns of [[Walpole, Massachusetts]] (founded in 1724), and [[Orford, New Hampshire]] (incorporated in 1761), take their respective names from Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historytoday.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/jh-plumb/british-prime-ministers-sir-robert-walpole|title=British Prime Ministers: Sir Robert Walpole {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole Street in Wolverhampton is named after Sir Robert Walpole.&lt;ref name=&quot;historytoday.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Walpole Island]], named for Sir Robert Walpole, comprises an island and an Indian reserve in southwestern [[Ontario]], Canada, on the border between Ontario and [[Michigan]]. It lies at the mouth of the [[St. Clair River]] on [[Lake St. Clair]], approximately thirty miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Detroit, Michigan, and of [[Windsor, Ontario]].

An in-joke on the educational [[YouTube]] channel [[Extra Credits]] is &quot;It was Walpole&quot;. It originated from their video on the [[South Sea Company]], which also detailed his rise to power.

==Marriage and children==

===Catherine Shorter===
On 30 July 1700, Walpole married [[Catherine Walpole|Catherine]], daughter of John Shorter of Bybrook in [[Ashford, Kent]]. She was described as &quot;a woman of exquisite beauty and accomplished manners&quot;.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}} Her £20,000 dowry was, according to her brother-in-law [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole|Horatio Walpole]], spent on the wedding, christenings and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=180}} cites Horace Walpole's ''Letters'', viii. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had two daughters and three sons:{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=205}}

An '''enchilada''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|n|tʃ|ᵻ|ˈ|l|ɑː|d|ə}}, {{IPA-es|entʃiˈlaða|lang}}) is a [[corn tortilla]] rolled around a filling and covered with a savory sauce. Enchiladas can be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables or combinations. Sauces can also be used to cover enchiladas, including [[chili pepper|chili]]-based sauces, such as [[salsa roja]], various [[mole (sauce)|mole]]s, or cheese-based sauces, such as [[chile con queso]]. Originating in [[Mexico]], enchiladas are a common dish in [[Mexican cuisine]].

==Etymology==
The [[Real Academia Española]] defines the word ''enchilada'', as used in Mexico, as a rolled [[maize]] [[tortilla]] stuffed with meat and covered with a [[tomato]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]] [[sauce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Sp Academy Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Diccionario de la Lengua Española, Vigésima segunda edición]] |title=enchilada |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=enchilada |accessdate=25 July 2008 |publisher=Real Academia Española |isbn=84-670-0317-0 |year=2003 |language=Spanish |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Styles Carvajal |first1=Carol |first2=Jane |last2=Horwood |first3=Nicholas |last3= Rollin |name-list-style=amp |title= Concise Oxford Spanish Dictionary: Spanish-English/English-Spanish |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198609773/page/253 253] |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198609773 |url-access=registration |quote=enchilada. |isbn=9780198609773 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Enchilada'' is the past participle of Spanish ''enchilar'', &quot;to add [[chili pepper]] to&quot;; literally, &quot;to season (or decorate) with chili&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Sp .Academy Dictionary2&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Diccionario de la Lengua Española, Vigésima segunda edición]] |title=enchilar |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=enchilar |accessdate=9 September 2010 |publisher=Real Academia Española |isbn=978-84-670-0317-8 |year=2015 |language=Spanish |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiomatic [[American English]] phrase &quot;the whole enchilada&quot; means &quot;the whole thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/whole+enchilada |title=whole enchilada - Idioms by The Free Dictionary |work=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=17 April 2015 |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]] times.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Zeldes |first=Leah A. |title=Eat this!

Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by [[Hernán Cortés]] in [[Coyoacán]], which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native [[Nahuatl]] name for the flat corn bread used was ''tlaxcalli''; the Spanish gave it the name ''tortilla''.)&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/mexico_smith.html |title=Tacos, Enchilidas and Refried Beans: The Invention of Mexican-American Cookery |accessdate=14 July 2008 |publisher=Oregon State University |work=Mexican References Food And Culture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718154326/http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/mexico_smith.html |archivedate=18 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm |title=History of Mexican Cuisine |accessdate=9 July 2008 |first=Margaret |last=Parker |date=12 October 2006 |work=Inner City Conservative Journal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017034655/http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm |archive-date=2008-10-17 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm |title=A Thumbnail History of Mexican Food |accessdate=9 July 2008 |first=Jim |last=Conrad |website=Mercados: Traditional Mexican Markets (blog) |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092347/http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm |archive-date=2008-07-05 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Tortilla_Taco_history.htm |title=History of Tortillas &amp; Tacos |accessdate=14 July 2008 |first=Linda |last=Stradley |publisher=What's Cooking America (blog) |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nahuatl]] word for enchilada is ''chīllapītzalli'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ʃiːlːapiːˈt͡salːi|}}, which is formed of the Nahuatl word for &quot;chili&quot;, ''chīlli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡ʃiːlːi|}} and the Nahuatl word for &quot;flute&quot;, ''[[tlapītzalli]]'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬapiːˈt͡salːi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karttunen |first=F. |year=1983 |title=An analytical dictionary of Nahuatl |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=52 |isbn=0-8061-2421-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, ''El cocinero mexicano'' (''&quot;The Mexican Chef&quot;''), published in 1831,&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Zeldes |first=Leah A. |title=Eat this!

Mexican cooking authority [[Diana Kennedy]] cites an early reference from an American traveler from 1883 who remarked, &quot;Enchiladas, a greasy tortilla sandwich containing chiles and a number of other uninviting looking compounds and other nasty messes, are sold everywhere, filling the air with a pungent, nauseous smell.&quot; Kennedy goes on to heartily disagree with that characterization, likely brought on by [[culture shock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Diana |year=2000 |title=The Essential Cuisines of Mexico |publisher=Clarkson Potter |page=54 |isbn=0-609-60355-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early English-language mention is found in the ''California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook'' (1914) by Bertha Haffner Ginger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook |last=Ginger |first=Bertha Haffner |year=1914 |publisher=Applewood Books |location=Bedford, Massachusetts (USA) |isbn=978-1-4290-1256-0 |pages=49–50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTMmULvFha8C&amp;q=California+Mexican-Spanish+Cookbook&amp;pg=PA121 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in [[Chili pepper|chili]] sauce and eaten without fillings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourmet Sleuth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/enchiladas.htm |title=Enchiladas as Mexican street food |accessdate=31 July 2008 |publisher=Gourmet Sleuth (blog) |year=2004 |first=Barbara |last=Bowman |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayless&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rickbayless.com/tv/season1/enchilada.html |title=Mexico one plate at a time: The Whole Enchilada |accessdate=31 July 2008 |first=Rick |last=Bayless |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201020623/http://www.rickbayless.com/tv/season1/enchilada.html |archive-date=2008-12-01 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. ''enchilada tapatia'' would be a [[recipe]] from [[Jalisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Recipe for Enchiladas Tapatias |url=http://www.mexicanrecipes.me/enchiladastapatias2.htm |accessdate=7 April 2012 |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=MexicanRecipes.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduran enchilada===

In [[Honduras]], enchiladas look and taste very different from those in Mexico; they are not corn tortillas rolled around a filling, but instead are flat, fried, corn tortillas  topped with ground beef, salad toppings (usually consisting of cabbage and tomato slices), a tomato sauce (often ketchup blended with butter and other spices such as cumin), and crumbled or shredded cheese. They look and taste much like what many people call a [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honduran Enchiladas |url=https://www.quericavida.com/recetas/enchiladas-hondurenas/0dea3c93-def4-41f7-825b-00c44a6c5d66 |website=Qué Rica Vida |accessdate=19 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

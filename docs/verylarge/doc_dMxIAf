In a debate with Pinker, post-colonial theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]] argued that, in ''Enlightenment Now,'' Pinker downplayed the immoral consequences of Enlightenment philosophy, such as inequality, slavery, imperialism, world wars, and genocide. Pinker responded that humanity, prior to the Enlightenment, had been characterized by poverty and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iainews.iai.tv/articles/does-the-enlightenment-need-defending-auid-1149|title=Does the Enlightenment Need Defending?|date=September 13, 2018|website=IAI TV - Philosophy for our times: cutting edge debates and talks from the world's leading thinkers|access-date=December 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker also wrote a detailed response to many such objections to the thesis presented in &quot;Enlightenment Now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quillette.com/2019/01/14/enlightenment-wars-some-reflections-on-enlightenment-now-one-year-later/|title=Enlightenment Wars: Some Reflections on 'Enlightenment Now,' One Year Later|date=January 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letter to the LSA==
In 2020, an open letter to the [[Linguistic Society of America]] requesting the removal of Pinker from its list of LSA Fellows and its list of media experts was signed by hundreds of academics.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |title=The Chilling Effect of an Attack on a Scholar |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/steven-pinker-will-be-just-fine/614323/ |access-date=10 August 2020 |work=The Atlantic |date=20 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZqWl5grm_F5Kn_0OarY9Q2jlOnk200PvhM5e3isPvY/mobilebasic?urp=gmail_link|title=LSA letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter accused Pinker of a &quot;pattern of drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence, in particular in the immediate aftermath of violent acts and/or protests against the systems that created them&quot;, citing as examples six tweets and a phrase used in his 2011 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Powell |first1=Michael |title=How a Famous Harvard Professor Became a Target Over His Tweets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/us/steven-pinker-harvard.html |access-date=16 August 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=15 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Henry Bessemer'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FIES|size=100%}} (19 January 1813 – 15 March 1898) was an English inventor, whose [[Bessemer process|steel-making process]] would become the most important technique for making [[steel]] in the nineteenth century for almost one hundred years from 1856 to 1950.{{sfn|Misa|1995}}&lt;ref&gt;Newton, David E. Chemistry of New Materials. New York: Facts on File, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a significant role in establishing the town of [[Sheffield]] as a major industrial centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheffield |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sheffield-England |accessdate=25 February 2019 |work=Encyclopaedia Britnannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bessemer had been trying to reduce the cost of steel-making for military ordnance, and developed his system for blowing air through molten pig iron to remove the impurities. This made steel easier, quicker and cheaper to manufacture, and revolutionized structural engineering. One of the most significant inventors of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], Bessemer also made over 100 other inventions in the fields of iron, steel and glass. Unlike most inventors, he managed to bring his own projects to fruition and profited financially from their success.

==Father: Anthony Bessemer==
Bessemer's father, [[Anthony Bessemer|Anthony]], was born in London into a Huguenot family, but moved to Paris when he was 21 years old. He was an inventor who, while engaged by the Paris Mint, made a machine for making medallions that could produce steel dies from a larger model. He became a member of the [[French Academy of Science]],{{sfn|Jeans|1884|pp=12–13}} for his improvements to the optical microscope when he was 26. He was forced to leave Paris by the [[French Revolution]], and returned to Britain. There he invented a process for making gold chains, which was successful, and enabled him to buy a small estate in the village of [[Charlton, Hertfordshire|Charlton]], near [[Hitchin]] in [[Hertfordshire]], where Henry was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlton House in England, Hitchin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/periodproperty/9821880/Homes-for-sale-with-blue-plaques.html?frame=2460183|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chartered Mechanical Engineer: The Journal of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Volume 12|page=519|year=1954|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVhVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bessemer he was given his name by his godfather Henry Caslon, who employed his father as a [[punchcutting|punchcutter]].{{sfn|Bessemer|1905|p=6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;1880 Printing Times and Lithographer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sir Henry Bessemer's Connection with Printing |journal=The Printing Times and Lithographer |date=1880 |pages=226–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3ZQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA226 |accessdate=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early inventions==
The invention from which Bessemer made his first fortune was a series of six steam-powered machines for making bronze powder, used in the manufacture of gold paint. As he relates in his autobiography,{{sfn|Bessemer|1905}} he examined the bronze powder made in [[Nuremberg]] which was the only place where it was made at the time. He then copied and improved the product and made it capable of being made on a simple production line. It was an early example of [[reverse engineering]] where a product is analysed, and then reconstituted. The process was kept secret, with only members of his immediate family having access to the factory. The Nuremberg powder, which was made by hand, retailed in London for £5&amp;nbsp;12[[£sd|s]] per pound and he eventually reduced the price to [[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]] {{nowrap|£ – 2 / 6}}, or about 1/40th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

&lt;/ref&gt;
The profits from sale of the paint allowed him to pursue his other inventions.

Bessemer patented a method for making a continuous ribbon of [[plate glass]] in 1848, but it was not commercially successful (see his autobiography, chapter 8). He gained experience in designing furnaces, which was to be of great use for his new steel-making process.

==Bessemer process==
{{Main|Bessemer process}}
[[Image:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bessemer converter]]
Henry Bessemer worked on the problem of manufacturing cheap [[steel]] for ordnance production from 1850 to 1855 when he patented his method.{{sfn|Boylston|1936|p=218}}

On 24 August 1856 Bessemer first described the process to a meeting of the [[British Association]] in Cheltenham which he titled &quot;The Manufacture of Iron Without Fuel.&quot;  It was published in full in ''[[The Times]]''.  The [[Bessemer process]] involved using oxygen in air blown through molten pig iron to burn off the impurities and thus create steel.{{sfn|Boylston|1936|pp=218–219}} [[James Nasmyth]] had been working on a similar idea for some time prior to this.  A reluctant patentor, and in this instance still working through some problems in his method, Nasmyth abandoned the project after hearing Bessemer at the meeting. Bessemer acknowledged the efforts of Nasmyth by offering him a one-third share of the value of his patent. Nasmyth turned it down as he was about to retire.{{sfn|Lord|1945}}

Many industries were constrained by the lack of steel, being reliant on [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] alone. Examples include railway structures such as bridges and tracks, where the treacherous nature of cast iron was keenly felt by many engineers and designers. There had been many accidents when cast iron beams collapsed suddenly, such as the [[Dee Bridge disaster]] of May 1847, the [[Wootton bridge collapse]] and the [[Bull bridge accident]] of 1860. The problem recurred at the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] of 1879, and failures continued until all cast iron under-bridges were replaced by steel structures. Wrought iron structures were much more reliable with very few failures.

Though this process is no longer commercially used, at the time of its invention it was of enormous industrial importance because it lowered the cost of production steel, leading to steel being widely substituted for [[cast iron]]. Bessemer's attention was drawn to the problem of steel manufacture in the course of an attempt to improve the construction of guns.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Implementation===
Bessemer licensed the patent for his process to five [[ironmaster]]s, but from the outset, the companies had great difficulty producing good quality steel.{{sfn|Bessemer|1905|p=172}} Mr [[Göran Fredrik Göransson]], a Swedish ironmaster, using the purer charcoal [[pig iron]] of that country, was the first to make good steel by the process, but only after many attempts. His results prompted Bessemer to try a purer iron obtained from [[Cumberland]] [[hematite]], but even with this he had only limited success&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. [[Robert Forester Mushet]] had carried out thousands of experiments at [[Darkhill Ironworks]], in the [[Forest of Dean]], and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of [[carbon]] and [[manganese]], in the form of [[spiegeleisen]]. This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Mushet, Robert Forester}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fweb.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.fweb.org.uk/Dean/towns/colefordproject/people/mushet.html Coleford, Towns in the Forest Of Dean ForestWeb (fweb) – Virtual guide to the Royal Forest Of Dean] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822112307/http://www.fweb.org.uk/Dean/towns/colefordproject/people/mushet.html |date=22 August 2012 }}. fweb. Retrieved on 1 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Anstis|1997}}

When Bessemer tried to induce makers to take up his improved system, he met with general rebuffs and was eventually driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. He erected steelworks in [[Sheffield]] in a business partnership with others, such as [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons]], and began to manufacture steel. At first the output was insignificant, but gradually the magnitude of the operations was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer &amp; Co. was underselling them to the extent of UK£10-£15 a ton. This argument to the pocket quickly had its effect, and licences were applied for in such numbers that, in royalties for the use of his process, Bessemer received a sum in all considerably exceeding a million pounds sterling.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Bessemer, Sir Henry|volume=3|page=823|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Mushet received nothing and by 1866 was destitute and in ill-health. In that year his 16-year-old daughter, Mary, travelled to London alone, to confront Bessemer at his offices, arguing that his success was based on the results of her father’s work.{{sfn|Bessemer|1905}} Bessemer decided to pay Mushet an annual pension of £300, a very considerable sum, which he paid for over 20 years; possibly with a view to keeping the Mushets from legal action.{{sfn|Bessemer|1905}}

W M Lord has said with regard to this success that &quot;Sir Henry Bessemer was somewhat exceptional. He had developed his process from an idea to a practical reality in his own lifetime and he was sufficiently of a businessman to have profited by it. In so many cases, inventions were not developed quickly and the plums went to other persons than the inventors.&quot;{{sfn|Lord|1945}}

==Other inventions==
[[File:Portrait of 'Steel' (4671260).jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Bessemer by [[Leslie Ward]] in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 6 November 1880]]

Bessemer was a prolific inventor and held at least 129 patents, spanning from 1838 to 1883. These included military ordnance, movable dies for embossed postage stamps, a screw extruder to extract sugar from sugar cane, and others in the fields of iron, steel and glass. These are described in some detail in his autobiography.

After suffering from seasickness in 1868, he designed the [[SS Bessemer|SS ''Bessemer'']] (also called the &quot;Bessemer Saloon&quot;), a passenger steamship with a cabin on [[gimbal]]s designed to stay level, however rough the sea, to save her passengers from seasickness. The mechanism – hydraulics controlled by a steersman watching a spirit level – worked in model form and in a trial version built in his garden in Denmark Hill, London. However, it never received a proper seagoing test as, when the ship demolished part of the Calais pier on her maiden voyage, investor confidence was lost and the ship was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/ehp-book/shb/hb20.htm The Bessemer Saloon Steam-Ship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227134724/http://www.history.rochester.edu/ehp-book/shb/hb20.htm |date=27 December 2007 }}, Chapter XX, ''Sir Henry Bessemer, F.R.S.
An Autobiography'', [http://www.history.rochester.edu/ehp-book/shb/ online at University of Rochester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003224130/http://www.history.rochester.edu/ehp-book/shb/ |date=3 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bessemer also obtained a patent in 1857 for the casting of metal between contrarotating rollers – a forerunner of today's [[continuous casting]] processes and remarkably, Bessemer's original idea has been implemented in the direct continuous casting of steel strip.

==Death==
[[Image:WNC_Bessemer.JPG|thumb|Headstone of Sir Henry Bessemer, West Norwood cemetery]]
Bessemer died in March 1898 at [[Denmark Hill]], London. He is buried in [[West Norwood Cemetery|West Norwood cemetery]],
London SE27. Other influential Victorians such as [[Henry Tate|Sir Henry Tate]], [[Henry Doulton|Sir Henry Doulton]] and [[Paul Reuter|Baron de Reuters]] are buried in the same cemetery.

==Honours and legacy==
Bessemer was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Queen Victoria]] for his contribution to science on 26 June 1879, and in the same year was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]].{{refn|{{London Gazette|issue=24739|page=2406|date= 1 Jul 1879}}{{efn|Coincidentally, on the same page of the London Gazette there is the knighting of [[Thomas Bouch]] who the following December became worldwide infamous as the designer and railway engineer of the Tay Bridge.}}}} An Honorary Membership was conferred on Bessemer by the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iesis.org/honorary-fellows.html IESIS Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]. Iesis.org. Retrieved on 1 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield's Kelham Island Industrial Heritage Museum maintains an early example of a Bessemer Converter for public viewing. A street was named after him in the town of [[Hitchin]] (Bessemer Close) bordering the village of [[Ickleford]] in 1995, and Bessemer Way in [[Rotherham]] is so named in his honour. In 2009, the public house &quot;The Fountain&quot; in Sheffield city centre was renamed &quot;The Bessemer&quot; in homage to Henry Bessemer, who had a huge impact on the [[Steel City]]'s development. In Workington, Cumbria, the local Wetherspoons pub is now named after him. In 2002 the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]] (IOM3) was established from mergers encompassing historical organisations including the [[Iron and Steel Institute]], of which Bessemer was President from 1871-73; the latter organisation instituted the [[Institute_of_Materials,_Minerals_and_Mining#Awards|Bessemer Gold Medal]] under his tenure and IOM3 still recognises Bessemer's legacy with an annual award of the medal for outstanding services to the steel industry; recent recipients include [[Indira Samarasekera]]. In 2003 Bessemer was named among the top 10 technological innovators in ''[[Human Accomplishment|Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950]]''. That a man who did so much for industrial development did not receive higher recognition from his own government was a source of deep regret for English engineers, who alluded to the fact that in the United States, where the Bessemer process found much use, eight cities or towns bore his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{NIE|wstitle=Bessemer, Henry|year=1905|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clover''' or '''trefoil''' are common names for plants of the [[genus]] '''''Trifolium''''' (Latin, ''tres'' &quot;three&quot; + ''folium'' &quot;leaf&quot;), consisting of about 300 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[legume]] or pea family [[Fabaceae]]. The genus has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] with highest diversity in the temperate [[Northern Hemisphere]], but many species also occur in [[South America]] and [[Africa]], including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small [[annual plant|annual]], [[biennial plant|biennial]], or short-lived [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] plants. Clover can be evergreen. The [[leaves]] are [[trifoliate]] (rarely quatrefoiled; see [[four-leaf clover]]), cinquefoil, or septfoil, with [[stipule]]s [[adnation|adnate]] to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the [[flower|calyx]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Other closely related genera often called clovers include ''[[Melilotus]]'' (sweet clover) and ''[[Medicago]]'' ([[alfalfa]] or [[Calvary clover]]).

==Cultivation==
Several species of clover are extensively cultivated as [[Fodder|fodder plants]]. The most widely cultivated clovers are [[white clover]], ''Trifolium repens'', and [[red clover]], ''Trifolium pratense''. Clover, either sown alone or in mixture with [[ryegrass]], has for a long time formed a staple crop for silaging, for several reasons: it grows freely, shooting up again after repeated mowings; it produces an abundant crop; it is palatable to and nutritious for [[livestock]];  it [[Nitrogen fixation|fixes nitrogen]], reducing the need for synthetic [[fertilizer]]s; it grows in a great range of [[soil]]s and [[climate]]s; and it is appropriate for either pasturage or [[green manure|green compost]]ing.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

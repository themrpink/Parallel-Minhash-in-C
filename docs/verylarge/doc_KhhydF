[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. In 1489 Leonardo began a series of anatomical drawings depicting the ideal human form. This work was carried out intermittently for over 2 decades. During this time he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.&lt;ref name=Boas&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 | pages=120–143}} (First published by Collins, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason | first=Stephen F. | title=A History of the Sciences | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso | publisher=Collier | year=1962 | location = New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso/page/550 550]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially adopting an [[Aristotle]]an understanding of anatomy, he later studied Galen and adopted a more empirical approach, eventually abandoning Galen altogether and relying entirely on his own direct observation.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite book | last=O'Malley| first=Charles D. | title=Leonardo on the Human Body | publisher=Dover| year=1983 | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; His surviving 750 drawings represent groundbreaking studies in anatomy.

As an artist-anatomist, Leonardo made many important discoveries, and had intended to publish a comprehensive treatise on human anatomy.&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt; For instance, he produced the first accurate depiction of the human spine, while his notes documenting his dissection of the Florentine [[centenarian]] contain the earliest known description of [[cirrhosis of the liver]] and [[arteriosclerosis]].&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/leonardo/anatomy.html | title=Leonardo the Man, His machines | publisher= Lairweb |accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to develop drawing techniques in anatomy to convey information using cross-sections and multiple angles, although centuries would pass before anatomical drawings became accepted as crucial for learning anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lifeinthefastlane.com/leonardo-da-vinci-first-anatomist/ | title=Leonardo Da Vinci first Anatomist | publisher= Life in The Fast Lane |accessdate=2 November 2014| date=2009-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; None of Leonardo's Notebooks were published during his lifetime, many being lost after his death, with the result that his anatomical discoveries remained unknown until they were later found and published centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ivc.edu/academics/schoolFA/arthistory/Documents/art2526projects/davinci_f07/page/paper.html | title=Leonardo Da Vinci's Notebook Project | publisher=Irvine Valley College | accessdate=2 November 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112202548/http://www.ivc.edu/academics/schoolFA/arthistory/Documents/art2526projects/davinci_f07/page/paper.html | archive-date=12 November 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galenic doctrine in Europe was first seriously challenged in the 16th century. Thanks to the [[printing press]], all over Europe a collective effort proceeded to circulate the works of Galen and later publish criticisms on their works. Vesalius openly denied Galen's anatomical teachings that are based on observations of other mammals, not human bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/anatomy/people_pages/vesalius.html|title=Andreas Vesalius {{!}} Anatomy in the Age of Enlightenment|website=www.umich.edu|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Vesalius]], born and educated in Belgium, contributed the most to human anatomy. Vesalius's success was due in large part to him exercising the skills of mindful dissections for the sake of understanding anatomy, much to the tune of Galen's &quot;anatomy project&quot; instead of focusing on the work of other scholars of the time in recovering the ancient texts of Hippocrates, Galen and others (which much of the medical community was focused around at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KLESTINEC|first=CYNTHIA|year=2004|title=A History of Anatomy Theaters in Sixteenth-Century Padua|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine|volume=59|pages=377|pmid=15270335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vesalius was the first to publish a treatise, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', that challenged Galen &quot;drawing for drawing&quot;. These drawings were a detailed series of explanations and vivid drawings of the anatomical parts of human bodies. Vesalius traveled all the way from [[Leuven]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/english/ |title=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven |publisher=Kuleuven.ac.be |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Padua]] for permission to dissect victims from the [[gallows]] without fear of persecution. His superbly executed drawings are triumphant descriptions of the differences between dogs and humans, but it took a century for Galen's influence to fade. His work led to anatomy marked a new era in the study of anatomy and its relation to medicine. Under Vesalius, anatomy became an actual discipline. &quot;His skill in and attention to dissection featured prominently in his publications as well as his demonstrations, in his research as well as his teaching.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klestinec |first=Cynthia |title=A History of Anatomy Theaters in Sixteenth-Century Padua |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |year=2004 |volume=59 | issue = 3 |pages=375–412 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/59.3.375|pmid=15270335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1540, Vesalius gave a public demonstration of the inaccuracies of Galen's anatomical theories, which are still the orthodoxy of the medical profession. Vesalius now has on display, for comparison purposes, the skeletons of a human being alongside that of an ape of which he was able to show, that in many cases, Galen's observations were indeed correct for the ape, but bear little relation to man. Clearly what was needed was a new account of human anatomy. While the lecturer explained human anatomy, as revealed by Galen more than 1000 years earlier, an assistant pointed to the equivalent details on a dissected corpse. At times, the assistant was unable to find the organ as described, but invariably the corpse rather than Galen was held to be in error. Vesalius then decided that he will dissect corpses himself and trust to the evidence of what he found. His approach was highly controversial, but his evident skill led to his appointment as professor of surgery and anatomy at the University of Padua.

A succession of researchers proceeded to refine the body of anatomical knowledge, giving their names to a number of anatomical structures along the way. The 16th and 17th centuries also witnessed significant advances in the understanding of the [[circulatory system]], as the purpose of [[valve]]s in veins was identified, the left-to-right ventricle flow of blood through the circulatory system was described, and the [[hepatic vein]]s were identified as a separate portion of the circulatory system. The [[lymphatic system]] was also identified as a separate system at this time.

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[Image:The medicine of Akbar 03.jpg|thumb|Illustration of The medicine of Akbar, Muqim Arzani, 1722]]

The study of anatomy flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. At the beginning of the 17th century, the use of dissecting human cadavers influenced anatomy, leading to a spike in the study of anatomy. The advent of the printing press facilitated the exchange of ideas. Because the study of anatomy concerned observation and drawings, the popularity of the anatomist was equal to the quality of his drawing talents, and one need not be an expert in Latin to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/dreamanatomy/da_info.html|title=Dream Anatomy: Exhibition Information|publisher=NLM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous artists studied anatomy, attended dissections, and published drawings for money, from [[Michelangelo]] to [[Rembrandt]]. For the first time, prominent universities could teach something about anatomy through drawings, rather than relying on knowledge of Latin. Contrary to popular belief, the Church neither objected to nor obstructed anatomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherhowse/5496340/False-myth-of-the-anatomy-lesson.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=The myth of the anatomy lesson | first=Christopher | last=Howse | date=10 June 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only certified anatomists were allowed to perform dissections, and sometimes then only yearly. These dissections were sponsored by the city councilors and often charged an admission fee, rather like a circus act for scholars. Many European cities, such as Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen, Padua, and Paris, all had Royal anatomists (or some such office) tied to local government. Indeed, [[Nicolaes Tulp]] was Mayor of Amsterdam for three terms. Though it was a risky business to perform dissections, and unpredictable depending on the availability of fresh bodies, ''attending'' dissections was legal.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The supply of printed anatomy books from Italy and France led to an increased demand for human cadavers for dissections. Since few bodies were voluntarily donated for dissection, royal charters were established which allowed prominent universities to use the bodies of hanged criminals for dissections. However, there was still a shortage of bodies that could not accommodate for the high demand of bodies. Until the middle of the 18th century, there was a quota of ten cadavers for each the Royal College of Physicians and the Company of Barber Surgeons, the only two groups permitted to perform dissections. During the first half of the 18th century, William Cheselden challenged the Company of Barber Surgeon's exclusive rights on dissections. He was the first to hold regular anatomy lectures and demonstrations. He also wrote ''The Anatomy of the Humane Body,'' a student handbook of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=M.

This allowed medical schools in England to legally dissect bodies of executed murderers for anatomical education and research and also aimed to prevent murder. To further increase the supply of cadavers, the government increased the number of crimes in which hanging was a punishment. Although the number of cadavers increased, it was still not enough to meet the demand of anatomical and medical training.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=Sanjib Kumar |date=2017-03-02 |title=Human cadaveric dissection: a historical account from ancient Greece to the modern era |journal=Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=153–169 |doi=10.5115/acb.2015.48.3.153 |pmc=4582158|pmid=26417475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men known as 'resurrectionists' emerged as outside parties, who would steal corpses for a living and sell the bodies to anatomy schools.

Dissections were considered a dishonor. The corpse was mutilated and not suitable for a funeral. By the end of the 18th century, many European countries had passed legislation similar to the Murder Act in England to meet the demand of fresh cadavers and to reduce crime. Countries allowed institutions to use unclaimed bodies of paupers, prison inmates, and people in psychiatric and charitable hospitals for dissection.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Unfortunately, the lack of bodies available for dissection and the controversial air that surrounded anatomy in the late 17th century and early 18th century caused a halt in progress that is evident by the lack of updates made to anatomical texts of the time between editions. Additionally, most of the investigations into anatomy were aimed at developing the knowledge of physiology and surgery. Naturally this meant that a close examination of the more detailed aspects of anatomy that could advance anatomical knowledge was not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=science and the practice of medicine in the nineteenth century|last=bynum|first=w.f|publisher=cambridge university press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-521-27205-6|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris Medicine was notorious for its influence on medical thought and its contributions to medical knowledge. The new hospital medicine in France during the late 18th century was brought about in part by the Law of 1794 which made physicians and surgeons equals in the world of medical care. The law came as a response to the increase demand for medical professionals capable of caring for the increase in injuries and diseases brought about by French Revolution. The law also supplemented schools with bodies for anatomical lessons. Ultimately this created the opportunity for the field of medicine to grow in the direction of &quot;localism of pathological anatomy, the development of appropriate diagnostic techniques, and the numerical approach to disease and therapeutics.&quot;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The British Parliament passed the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which finally provided for an adequate and legitimate supply of corpses by allowing legal dissection of executed murderers. The view of anatomist at the time, however, became similar to that of an executioner. Having one's body dissected was seen as a punishment worse than death, &quot;if you stole a pig, you were hung. If you killed a man, you were hung and then dissected.&quot; Demand grew so great that some anatomist resorted to dissecting their own family members as well as robbing bodies from their graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |title=Stiff: The curious Lives of Human Cadavers |url=https://archive.org/details/stiffcuriouslive00roac_145 |url-access=registration |year=2003| publisher=W.W.

Many Europeans interested in the study of anatomy traveled to Italy, then the centre of anatomy. Only in Italy could certain important research methods be used, such as dissections on women. [[Realdo Colombo]] (also known as Realdus Columbus) and [[Gabriele Falloppio]] were pupils of [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]]. Columbus, as Vesalius's immediate successor in Padua, and afterwards professor at Rome, distinguished himself by describing the shape and cavities of the heart, the structure of the pulmonary artery and aorta and their valves, and tracing the course of the blood from the right to the left side of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450-1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 | pages=254–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in anatomy lead to various discoveries and findings. In 1628, English physician William Harvey observed circulating blood through dissections of his father's and sister's bodies. He published ''De moto cordis et sanguinis'', a treatise in which he explained his theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In addition, during the 17th century, Galileo Galilei introduced the experimental method to scientific research. This led to innovation and change in anatomy. In Tuscany and Florence, Marcello Malpighi founded microscopic anatomy, and Nils Steensen studied the anatomy of lymph nodes and salivary glands. By the end of the 17th century, Gaetano Zumbo developed anatomical wax modeling techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Orlandini |first1=Giovanni E.|last2=Paternostro |first2=Ferdinando|date=2010 |title=Anatomy and anatomists in Tuscany in the 17th century|journal=Italian Journal of Anatomy and Embryology = Archivio Italiano di Anatomia ed Embriologia |volume=115|issue=3 |pages=167–174 |pmid=21287970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Valsalva, a student of Malpighi and a professor of anatomy at University of Bologna, was one of the greatest anatomists of the time.

This became known as Balsaming. In the 1660s the Dutch were also attempting to preserve organs by injecting wax to keep the organ's shape. Dyes and mercury were added to the wax to better differentiate and see various anatomical structures for academic and research anatomy. By the late 18th century, Thomas Pole published ''The Anatomic Instructor'', which detailed how to dry and preserve specimens and soft tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Piers D |last2=Boston |first2=Ceridwen|last3=Chamberlain|first3=Andrew T |last4=Chaplin |first4=Simon |last5=Chauhan|first5=Vin |last6=Evans|first6=Jonathan |last7=Fowler|first7=Louise|last8=Powers |first8=Natasha |last9=Walker |first9=Don |date=2017-03-02 |title=The study of anatomy in England from 1700 to the early 20th century |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=219|issue=2 |pages=91–99 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01381.x |pmc=3162231|pmid=21496014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 16th century, anatomists began exploring and pushing for contention that the study of anatomy could contribute to advancing the boundaries of natural philosophy. However, the majority of students were more interested in the practicality of anatomy, and less so in the advancement of knowledge of the subject. Students were interested in the technique of dissection rather than the philosophy of anatomy, and this was reflected in their criticism of Professors such as Girolamo Fabrici.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--should MERGE these refs to same paper--&gt;[[Anatomical theatre]]s became a popular form for anatomical teaching in the early 16th century. The [[University of Padua]] was the first and most widely known theatre, founded in 1594. As a result, Italy became the center for human dissection. People came from all over to watch as professors taught lectures on the [[human physiology]] and anatomy, as anyone was welcome to witness the spectacle. Participants &quot;were fascinated by corporeal display, by the body undergoing dissection&quot;.&lt;ref name=Klestinec&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klestinec |first=Cynthia |title=A History of Anatomy Theaters in Sixteenth-Century Padua|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences |year=2004 |volume=59 | issue = 3 |pages=375–412 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/59.3.375|pmid=15270335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most professors did not do the dissections themselves. Instead they sat in seats above the bodies while hired hands did the cutting. Students and observers would be placed around the table in a circular, stadium-like arena and listen as professors explained the various anatomical parts. As anatomy theaters gained popularity throughout the 16th century, protocols were adjusted to account for the disruptions of students. Students moved beyond simply being eager to participate, and began stealing and vandalizing cadavers. Students were thus instructed to sit quietly and were to be penalized for disrupting the dissection. Moreover, preparatory lectures were mandatory in order to introduce the &quot;subsequent observation of anatomy&quot;. The demonstrations were structured into dissections and lectures. The dissections focused on the skill of autopsy/vivisection while the lectures would center on the philosophical questions of anatomy. This is exemplary of how anatomy was viewed not only as the study of structures but also the study of the &quot;body as an extension of the soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klestinec|first=Cynthia|year=2004|title=A History of Anatomy Theaters in Sixteenth-Century Padua |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine|volume=59|issue=3|pages=391–392|doi=10.1093/jhmas/59.3.375|pmid=15270335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century eventually saw a move from anatomical theatres to classrooms, reducing &quot;the number of people who could benefit from each cadaver&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siddiquey 2009&quot;/&gt;

{{further|History of anatomy in the 19th century}}
During the 19th century, anatomical research was extended with [[histology]] and [[developmental biology]] of both humans and [[animal]]s. Women, who were not allowed to attend medical school, could attend the anatomy theatres. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons forced unregulated schools to close.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McLachlan J. |author2=Patten D. | year = 2006 | title = Anatomy teaching: ghosts of the past, present and future | url = | journal = Medical Education | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 243–53 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02401.x|pmid=16483327 |s2cid=30909540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinarz J | year = 2005 | title = The age of museum medicine: The rise and fall of the medical museum at Birmingham's School of Medicine | url = | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 419–37 | doi=10.1093/shm/hki050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern anatomy==
Anatomical research in the past hundred years has taken advantage of technological developments and growing understanding of sciences such as [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] and [[molecular biology]] to create a thorough understanding of the body's organs and structures. Disciplines such as [[endocrinology]] have explained the purpose of glands that anatomists previously could not explain; medical devices such as [[MRI]] machines and [[CAT scan]]ners have enabled researchers to study organs, living or dead, in unprecedented detail. Progress today in anatomy is centered in the development, evolution, and function of anatomical features, as the macroscopic aspects of human anatomy have largely been catalogued. Non-human anatomy is particularly active as researchers use techniques ranging from [[finite element analysis]] to molecular biology.

To save time, some medical schools such as Birmingham, England have adopted prosection, where a demonstrator dissects and explains to an audience, in place of dissection by students. This enables students to observe more than one body. Improvements in colour images and photography means that an anatomy text is no longer an aid to dissection but rather a central material to learn from. Plastic [[anatomical model]]s are regularly used in anatomy teaching, offering a good substitute to the real thing. Use of living models for anatomy demonstration is once again becoming popular within teaching of anatomy. Surface landmarks that can be [[palpated]] on another individual provide practice for future clinical situations. It is possible to do this on oneself; in the Integrated Biology course at the [[University of Berkeley]], students are encouraged to &quot;introspect&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond M. 2005. Integrative Biology 131 - Lecture 01: Organization of Body. Berkeley, University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; on themselves and link what they are being taught to their own body.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53&quot;/&gt;

Donations of bodies have declined with public confidence in the medical profession.&lt;ref&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News. 2001. Organ scandal background. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1136723.stm Accessed 22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] has tightened up the availability of resources to anatomy departments. The outbreaks of [[bovine spongiform encephalitis]] (BSE) in the late 1980s and early 1990s further restricted the handling of brain tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Demiryurek D. |author2 = Bayramoglu A|author3=Ustacelebi S. | year = 2002 | title = Infective agents in fixed human cadavers: a brief review and suggested guidelines | doi =10.1002/ar.10143 | journal = Anatomical Record | volume = 269 | issue = 1| pages = 194–7 |pmid = 12209557|s2cid = 20948827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy of [[Gunther von Hagens]] and public displays of dissections, preserved by [[plastination]], may divide opinions on what is ethical or legal.&lt;ref&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News. 2002 Controversial autopsy goes ahead. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2493291.stm Accessed 22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Central City, Colorado (1862).png|thumb|left|Central City, 1862]]
[[File:OperaHouseCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Central City Opera House, 1934]]

On May 6, 1859, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, John H. Gregory found a [[gold]]-bearing vein (the Gregory Lode) in Gregory Gulch between Black Hawk and Central City. Within two months many other veins were discovered, including the Bates, Gunnell, Kansas, and Burroughs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sims&quot;/&gt; By 1860, as many as 10,000 prospectors had flocked to the town, then known as Mountain City,&lt;ref&gt;The name of the post office until 1869, see page 101, Bauer, William H.; Ozment, James L.; and Willard, John H., ''Colorado Post Offices, 1859-1989: A Comprehensive Listing of Post Offices, Stations, and Branches'', Colorado Railroad Museum (May 1990), hardcover, 280 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-918654-42-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding prospects, but most soon left, many returning east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central City, Colorado|url=http://www.westernmininghistory.com/towns/colorado/central-city/|publisher=WesternMiningHistory.Com|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1900 census showed 3,114 people.

The year 1863 brought the first attempt by hard rock miners to form a hard rock miners' union. Of 125 miners signing a union resolution in Central City, about fifty broke windows and doors at the Bob Tail mine, forcing other workers out. After a night of shooting and fighting, the union effort among Central City miners failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman, ''Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910'', 1979, pages 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Chinese American|Chinese]] immigrants lived in Central City during the early days working the [[placer deposit]]s of Gregory Gulch. They were forbidden work in the underground mines. Most of them are believed to have returned to [[China]] after making their stake.

The frontier gambler [[Poker Alice]] lived for a time in Central City and several other Colorado mining communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-pokeralice.html|title=Kathy Weiser, &quot;Poker Alice - Famous Frontier Gambler&quot;|publisher=legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold mining in the Central City district decreased rapidly between 1900 and 1920, as the veins were exhausted. Mining revived in the early 1930s in response to the increase in the price of gold from $20 to $35 per ounce, but then virtually shut down during [[World War II]] when gold mining was declared nonessential to the war effort. The district was enlivened in the 1950s by efforts to locate [[uranium]] deposits, but these proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sims&quot;&gt;Paul K. Sims and others (1963) ''Economic Geology of the Central City District, Gilpin County, Colorado'', US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 359, pp.7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Central City and its sister city Black Hawk fell to a few hundred by the 1950s. [[Casino]] gambling was introduced in both towns in the early 1990s, but had more success in Black Hawk (which has 18 casinos) than in Central City (which has 6 casinos), partly because the main road to Central City passed through Black Hawk, tempting gamblers to stop in Black Hawk instead. In an effort to compete, Central City completed a four-lane, {{convert|8.4|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Central City Parkway|parkway]] from [[Interstate 70]] to Central City, without going through Black Hawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralcityhighway.com/pdfs/onepagebrochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220061326/http://www.centralcityhighway.com/pdfs/onepagebrochure.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highway was completed in 2004, but Black Hawk, which prior to the introduction of gambling was much smaller than Central City, continues to generate more than seven times the gambling revenue that Central City does. To compete, Central City has recently eliminated height restrictions for building on undeveloped land. Buildings were previously limited to heights of {{convert|53|ft|m}}, so as not to overshadow the town's historic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Vuong, &quot;Eased gambling, building rules give Central City a second chance,&quot; ''Denver Post'', 1 July 2009, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax from the gambling revenue provides funding for the State Historical Fund, administered by the [[Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradohistory-oahp.org/programareas/shf/shfindex.htm State Historical Fund], [[Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation|Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation]], [[Colorado Historical Society]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Central City is located in southern Gilpin County. The city limits extend south along the Central City Parkway into Clear Creek County, as far as Interstate 70. The city is bordered by [[Black Hawk, Colorado|Black Hawk]] to the east and [[Idaho Springs, Colorado|Idaho Springs]] to the south.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.3|km2|disp=flip}}. None of the area is covered with water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt;

===1992–present===

====Discontinuities====
[[File:Eisenhower Interstate System sign.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative sign introduced in 1993. The system was established during Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidency, and the five stars commemorate his rank as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] during World War II.]]

The system was proclaimed complete in 1992, but two of the original Interstates—[[Interstate 95|I-95]] and [[Interstate 70|I-70]]—were not continuous: both of these discontinuities were due to local opposition, which blocked efforts to build the necessary connections to fully complete the system. I-95 was made a continuous freeway in 2018,&lt;ref name=&quot;sofield&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Tom |last = Sofield |date = September 22, 2018 |title = Decades in the Making, I-95, Turnpike Connector Opens to Motorists |url = http://levittownnow.com/2018/09/22/decades-in-the-making-i-95-turnpike-connector-opens-to-motorists/ |work = Levittown Now |access-date = September 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus I-70 remains the only original Interstate with a discontinuity.

I-95 was discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the [[Somerset Freeway]]. This situation was remedied when the construction of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project]] started in 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;PA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author = Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission  |date = n.d. |url = http://www.paturnpikei95.com/pdf/DACMeeting050914.pdf |publisher = Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission |work = I-95/I-276 Interchange Project Meeting Design Management Summary |title = Draft: Design Advisory Committee Meeting No. 2 |access-date = May 11, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002051518/http://www.paturnpikei95.com/pdf/DACMeeting050914.pdf |archive-date = October 2, 2013 |url-status = live |author-link = Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partially opened on September 22, 2018, which was already enough to fill the gap.&lt;ref name=&quot;sofield&quot; /&gt;

However, I-70 remains discontinuous in [[Pennsylvania]], because of the lack of a direct interchange with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at the eastern end of the [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] near [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania|Breezewood]]. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|US-30]] (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa.dot.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |title = Why Does The Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = n.d. |access-date = July 15, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518082124/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |archive-date = May 18, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Dawida seeks to merge I-70, turnpike at Breezewood |first = Gary |last = Tuna |work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date = July 27, 1989 |via = Google News |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O7RRAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4854,6978383&amp;dq=robert-jubelirer+breezewood&amp;hl=en |access-date = November 19, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930132552/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O7RRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wm4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4854,6978383&amp;dq=robert-jubelirer+breezewood&amp;hl=en |archive-date = September 30, 2015 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion====
{{see also|Future Interstate Highways}}
The Interstate Highway System has been expanded numerous times. The expansions have both created new designations and extended existing designations. For example, [[Interstate 49|I-49]], added to the system in the 1980s as a freeway in [[Louisiana]], was designated as an expansion corridor, and FHWA approved the expanded route north from [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The freeway exists today as separate completed segments, with segments under construction or in the planning phase between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.modot.org/southwest_archive/I-49MapsandInformation.htm |author = Missouri Department of Transportation |date = n.d. |publisher = Missouri Department of Transportation |work = Interstate I-49 Expansion Corridor in Southwest District of Missouri |title = Converting US Route 71 to I-49 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117094333/http://www.modot.org/southwest_archive/I-49MapsandInformation.htm |archive-date = January 17, 2013 |author-link = Missouri Department of Transportation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the FHWA designated the entire Interstate Highway System as part of the larger [[Pan-American Highway]] System,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department |url = http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/445/Memorial.pdf |title = State of New Mexico Memorial Designations and Dedications of Highways, Structures and Buildings |year = 2007 |location = Santa Fe |publisher = New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department |page = 14 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081405/http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/contents/445/Memorial.pdf |archive-date = July 16, 2011 |author-link = New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least two proposed Interstate expansions were initiated to help trade with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] spurred by the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Long-term plans for [[Interstate 69|I-69]], which currently exists in several separate completed segments (the largest of which are in [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]]), is to have the highway route extend from [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico to [[Ontario]], Canada. The planned [[Interstate 11|I-11]] will then bridge the Interstate gap between [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and thus form part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] (along with [[Interstate 19|I-19]], and portions of [[Interstate 10|I-10]] and [[Interstate 15|I-15]]) between [[Sonora]], Mexico and [[Alberta]], Canada.

===Urban Interstates abandoned because of local opposition===
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}
{{main|Highway revolts in the United States}}
Political opposition from residents canceled many freeway projects around the United States, including:
* [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|I-40]] in Memphis, Tennessee was rerouted and part of the original I-40 is still in use as the eastern half of [[Sam Cooper Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006a|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interstate 66|I-66]] in the [[District of Columbia]] was abandoned in 1977.
* [[Interstate 69|I-69]] was to continue past its terminus at Interstate 465 to intersect with [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 65]] at the north split, northeast of downtown [[Indianapolis]]. Though local opposition led to the cancellation of this project in 1981, bridges and ramps for the connection into the &quot;north split&quot; remain visible.
* [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Baltimore]] was supposed to run from the Baltimore Beltway ([[Interstate 695 in Maryland|Interstate 695]]), which surrounds the city to terminate at [[I-95]], the East Coast thoroughfare that runs through Maryland and Baltimore on a diagonal course, northeast to southwest; the connection was cancelled on the mid-1970s due to its routing through [[Gwynns Falls Leakin Park|Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park]], a wilderness urban park reserve following the [[Gwynns Falls]] stream through West Baltimore. This included the cancellation of [[Interstate 170 (Maryland)|I-170]], partially built and in use as U.S. Route 40, and nicknamed the Highway to Nowhere.
* [[Interstate 78 in New York|I-78]] in New York City was canceled along with portions with [[Interstate 278|I-278]], [[Interstate 478|I-478]], and [[Interstate 878|I-878]]. I-878 was supposed to be part of I-78, and I-478 and I-278 were to be spur routes.
* [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]] in San Francisco was originally planned to travel past the city's Civic Center along the Panhandle Freeway into [[Golden Gate Park]] and terminate at the original alignment of [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]]/[[California State Route 1|SR 1]]. The city canceled this and several other freeways in 1958. Similarly, more than 20 years later, Sacramento canceled plans to upgrade I-80 to Interstate Standards and rerouted the freeway on what was then I-880 that traveled north of Downtown Sacramento.
* [[Interstate 83|I-83]], southern extension of the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] (southern [[I-83]]) in [[Baltimore]] was supposed run along the waterfront of the [[Patapsco River]] / [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]] to connect to [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], bisecting historic neighborhoods of [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] and [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]], but the connection was never built.
* [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] through the [[District of Columbia]] into [[Maryland]] was abandoned in 1977. Instead it was rerouted to [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495 (Capital Beltway)]]. The completed section is now [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia–Virginia)|I-395]].
* [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] was originally planned to run up the [[Southwest Corridor (Massachusetts)|Southwest Expressway]] and meet [[Interstate 93|I-93]], where the two highways would travel along the [[Central Artery]] through downtown [[Boston]], but was rerouted onto the [[Massachusetts State Highway 128|Route 128]] beltway due to widespread opposition. This revolt also included the cancellation of the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]], connecting I-93 to [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]] and a cancelled section of the [[U.S. Route 3|Northwest Expressway]] which would have carried [[U.S. Route 3|US&amp;nbsp;3]] inside the Route 128 beltway, meeting with [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].

==Standards==
{{Main|Interstate Highway standards}}
The [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the [[controlled-access highway|controlled access]] nature of the roads. With few [[List of gaps in Interstate Highways|exceptions]], [[traffic light]]s (and cross traffic in general) are limited to [[Toll house|toll booths]] and [[ramp meter]]s (metered flow control for lane merging during [[rush hour]]).

===Speed limits===
{{Further|Speed limits in the United States|National Maximum Speed Law}}
[[File:2019-07-15 11 10 50 View south along Interstate 95 from the overpass for Maryland State Route 175 (Waterloo Road-Rouse Parkway) in Columbia, Howard County, Maryland.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Interstate 95|I-95]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]], built to modern standards]]
Being [[freeway]]s, Interstate Highways usually have the highest [[speed limit]]s in a given area. Speed limits are determined by individual states. From 1974 to 1986, the maximum speed limit on any highway in the United States was {{Convert|55|mi/h|km/h|round=5}}, in accordance with federal law.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes3a&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Nixon Approves Limit of 55 M.P.H. |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40610FD3F58137B93C1A9178AD85F408785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=nixon%20approves%20limit%20of%2055&amp;st=cse |access-date = July 27, 2008 |work = The New York Times |pages = 1, 24 |date = January 3, 1974 |url-access = subscription |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095932/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40610FD3F58137B93C1A9178AD85F408785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=nixon%20approves%20limit%20of%2055&amp;st=cse |archive-date = June 5, 2011 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, lower limits are established in [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and coastal states, while higher speed limits are established in inland states west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.mit.edu/~jfc/laws.html |title = State traffic and speed laws |date = October 11, 2007 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology |last = Carr |first = John |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130807221607/http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/laws.html |archive-date = August 7, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the maximum speed limit is {{convert|75|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in northern Maine, varies between {{convert|50|and|70|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Paul |last = Koenig |date = May 27, 2014 |title = Speed Limit on Much of I-295 Rises to 70&amp;nbsp;MPH |url = http://www.pressherald.com/2014/05/27/speed_limt_on_much_of_maine_turnpike__i-295_ro_rise_to_70_mph/ |work = [[Portland Press Herald]] |access-date = July 22, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727171449/http://www.pressherald.com/2014/05/27/speed_limt_on_much_of_maine_turnpike__i-295_ro_rise_to_70_mph/ |archive-date = July 27, 2014 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; from southern Maine to New Jersey, and is {{convert|50|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in New York City and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit&quot; /&gt; Currently, rural speed limits elsewhere generally range from {{convert|65|to|80|mph|km/h|round=5}}. Several portions of various highways such as [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] and [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in rural western Texas, [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] in Nevada between Fernley and Winnemucca (except around Lovelock) and portions of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]], [[Interstate 70 in Utah|I-70]], [[Interstate 80 in Utah|I-80]], and [[Interstate 84 in Utah|I-84]] in Utah have a speed limit of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}. Other Interstates in Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.

In some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]] is {{convert|50|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in downtown [[Cleveland]] because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of {{convert|35|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} in a heavily congested area; [[Interstate 70 in West Virginia|I-70]] through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through the [[Wheeling Tunnel]] and most of downtown Wheeling; and [[Interstate 68|I-68]] has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|40|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} through [[Cumberland, Maryland]], because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], for nearly 30&amp;nbsp;years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than {{convert|9,000|lbs|kg}} [[gross vehicle weight]]. [[Interstate 93|I-93]] in [[Franconia Notch State Park]] in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80 and 84 in Utah have speed limits as high as {{convert|70|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}} within the [[Salt Lake City]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] areas, and [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|I-25]] in New Mexico within the [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Vegas, New Mexico|Las Vegas]] areas along with [[Interstate 20 in Texas|I-20]] in Texas along Odessa and [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Interstate 29 in North Dakota|I-29]] in North Dakota along the [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] area have higher speed limits of {{convert|75|mph|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}.

===Other uses===
As one of the components of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the [[Strategic Highway Network]], a system of roads identified as critical to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;slater_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |title = The National Highway System: A Commitment to America's Future |magazine = Public Roads |last = Slater |first = Rodney E. |date = Spring 1996 |volume = 59 |issue = 4 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |issn = 0033-3735 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141216112008/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/96spring/p96sp2.cfm |archive-date = December 16, 2014 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as [[contraflow lane reversal]], has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to [[Hurricane Georges]]' landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1999, lanes of [[Interstate 16 in Georgia|I-16]] and [[Interstate 26 in South Carolina|I-26]] were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of [[Hurricane Floyd]] with mixed results.&lt;ref name=&quot;onewayout&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |title = &quot;One-Way-Out&quot;: Contraflow Freeway Operation for Hurricane Evacuation |last = Wolshon |first = Brian |magazine = National Hazards Review |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 105–112 |date = August 2001 |access-date = January 10, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006200038/http://www.asce.org/files/pdf/hurricane/Evacuation_and_Shelters/One_Way_Out~Contraflow_Freeway_Operation_for_Hurricane_Evacuation.pdf |archive-date = October 6, 2008 |doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2001)2:3(105) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 contraflow was employed ahead of [[Hurricane Charley]] in the [[Tampa, Florida]] area and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] before the landfall of [[Hurricane Ivan]];&lt;ref name=&quot;contraflow_ivan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |title = Contraflow Implementation Experiences in the Southern Coastal States |publisher = [[Florida Department of Transportation]] |access-date = September 27, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025045623/http://www.floridaits.com/PDFs/TWO60-Contraflow/060330-Experiences-V2.pdf |archive-date = October 25, 2007 |first = Tahira |last = Faquir |date = March 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations. Engineers began to apply lessons learned from the analysis of prior contraflow operations, including limiting exits, removing troopers (to keep traffic flowing instead of having drivers stop for directions), and improving the dissemination of public information. As a result, the 2005 evacuation of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to [[Hurricane Katrina]] ran much more smoothly.&lt;ref name=&quot;roadsandbridges_contraflow&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.roadsbridges.com/contra-productive |work = Roads &amp; Bridges |date = December 2006b |access-date = January 10, 2008 |last = McNichol |first = Dan |title = Contra Productive |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191558/http://www.roadsbridges.com/popup_app/index.cfm?fuseaction=showArticle&amp;appDirectory=rb&amp;articleID=7519&amp;forPrint=yes |archive-date = July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[urban legend]], early regulations required that one out of every five miles of the Interstate Highway System must be built straight and flat, so as to be usable by aircraft during times of war. There is no evidence of this rule being included in any Interstate legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Barbara |last = Mikkelson |date = April 1, 2011 |url = http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/airstrip.asp |title = Interstate Highways as Airstrips |publisher = Snopes |access-date = March 15, 2017 |archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20051201041356/http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/airstrip.asp |archive-date = December 1, 2005 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/00mayjun/onemileinfive.cfm |title = One Mile in Five: Debunking the Myth |last = Weingroff |first = Richard F. |date = May–June 2000 |magazine = Public Roads |volume = 63 |issue = 6 |access-date = December 14, 2010 |issn = 0033-3735 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101212070757/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/00mayjun/onemileinfive.cfm |archive-date = December 12, 2010 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbering scheme for the Interstate Highway System was developed in 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association's present numbering policy dates back to August 10, 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |title = Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date = January 2000 |access-date = January 23, 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234238/http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archive-date = November 1, 2006 |author-link = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the contiguous United States, primary Interstates—also called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstates—are assigned numbers less than 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho2&quot; /&gt;

While numerous exceptions do exist, there is a general scheme for numbering Interstates. Primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers, while shorter routes (such as spurs, loops, and short connecting roads) are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route (thus, [[Interstate 294|I-294]] is a loop that connects at both ends to [[Interstate 94|I-94]], while [[Interstate 787|I-787]] is a short spur route attached to [[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]). In the numbering scheme for the primary routes, east–west highways are assigned even numbers and north–south highways are assigned odd numbers.

Several two-digit numbers are shared between road segments at opposite ends of the country for various reasons. Some such highways are incomplete Interstates (such as [[Interstate 69|I-69]] and [[Interstate 74|I-74]]) and some just happen to share route designations (such as [[Interstate 76 (disambiguation)|I-76]], [[Interstate 84 (disambiguation)|I-84]], [[Interstate 86 (disambiguation)|I‑86]], [[Interstate 87 (disambiguation)|I-87]], and [[Interstate 88 (disambiguation)|I-88]]). Some of these were due to a change in the numbering system as a result of a new policy adopted in 1973. Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western [[Interstate 84 (west)|I‑84]] was I‑80N, as it went north from [[Interstate 80|I‑80]]. The new policy stated, &quot;No new divided numbers (such as [[Interstate 35W (disambiguation)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (disambiguation)|I-35E]], etc.) shall be adopted.&quot; The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] still exist in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] in Texas, and an [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|I-35E]] that run through [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota, still exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho2&quot; /&gt; Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into [[Interstate 69W|I-69W]], [[Interstate 69E|I-69E]], and [[Interstate 69C|I-69C]] (for Central).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Essex |first = Allen |title = State Adds I-69 to Interstate System |url = http://brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |access-date = July 17, 2013 |newspaper = The Brownsville Herald |date = May 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227191039/http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/valley/article_cbb0e04a-c99b-11e2-8c72-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=jqm |archive-date = February 27, 2017 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho2&quot; /&gt; This is referred to as a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] or overlap. For example, [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I‑75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I‑85]] share the same roadway in [[Atlanta]]; this {{convert|7.4|mi|km|adj=on}} section, called the [[Downtown Connector]], is labeled both I‑75 and I‑85. Concurrencies between Interstate and U.S. Route numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho2&quot; /&gt; In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such [[wrong-way concurrency]] is found between [[Wytheville, Virginia|Wytheville]] and [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia|Fort Chiswell]], Virginia, where [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|I‑81]] north and [[Interstate 77 in Virginia|I‑77]] south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I‑81 south and I‑77 north.

===Auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates===
{{See also|List of auxiliary Interstate Highways}}
[[File:FHWA Auxiliary Route Numbering Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Examples of the auxiliary Interstate Highway numbering system. An odd hundreds digit means the route connects at only one end to the rest of the interstate system, known as a &quot;spur route&quot; (see I-310 and I-510 in image). An even hundreds digit means the route connects at both ends, which could be a bypass route (which has two termini) (see I-210 and I-810 in image) or a radial route (known also as a beltway, beltline, or circumferential route) (see I-610 in image).]]

Auxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve [[urban area]]s. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either east–west or north–south, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number. For instance, [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] in Massachusetts is labeled north–south, while [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|I-195]] in New Jersey is labeled east–west. Some looped Interstate routes use [[inner–outer directions]] instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhwa_route_log&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |author = Federal Highway Administration |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = March 22, 2007 |access-date = January 23, 2008 |title = FHWA Route Log and Finder List |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010643/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/index.cfm |archive-date = June 5, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.

===Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico===
[[File:Puerto Rico Interstates.svg|thumb|Map of routes in [[Puerto Rico]] that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]
[[File:Interstate Alaska map.png|thumb|Map of routes in Alaska that receive funding from the Interstate program, but are not signed as Interstate Highways]]

The Interstate Highway System also extends to [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Puerto Rico]], even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.

The Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of [[Oahu]], carry the prefix '''H'''. There are three one-digit routes in the state ([[Interstate H-1|H-1]], [[Interstate H-2|H-2]], and [[Interstate H-3|H-3]]) and one auxiliary route ([[Interstate H-201|H-201]]). These Interstates connect several [[U.S. Air Force|military]] and [[U.S. Navy|naval]] bases together, as well as the important cities and towns spread across Oahu, and especially the metropolis of [[Honolulu]].

Both Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90&amp;nbsp;percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The [[Interstate Highways in Alaska|Interstates of Alaska]] and [[Interstate Highways in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes '''A''' and '''PR''', respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official [[Interstate Highway standards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA2&quot; /&gt;

===Mile markers and exit numbers===
On one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west.  As with all guidelines for Interstate routes, however, numerous exceptions exist.

Three-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location. In other words, mile marker&amp;nbsp;1 on [[I-465]], a {{convert|53|mi|km|adj=on}} route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with I-65 on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker&amp;nbsp;53 is just east of this same junction. An exception is [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of I-95.

The exit numbers of interchanges are either sequential or distance-based so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. Under the latter system, a single mile with multiple exits may be assigned letter suffixes, for example on [[Interstate 890|I‑890]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;INDOT-Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers &amp; Exit Numbering&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |access-date = November 26, 2011 |title = Understanding Interstate Route Numbering, Mile Markers &amp; Exit Numbering |author = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = n.d. |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515104711/http://www.in.gov/indot/2488.htm |archive-date = May 15, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations. These routes do not have to comply to Interstate construction or limited-access standards but are routes that may be identified and approved by the association. The same route marking policy applies to both US Numbered Highways and Interstate Highways; however, [[business route]] designations are sometimes used for Interstate Highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title = Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date = January 2000 |access-date = January 23, 2008 |author = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101234239/http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archive-date = November 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as [[List of business routes of the Interstate Highway System|Business Loops &amp; Business Spurs]], these routes principally travel through the corporate limits of a city, passing through the central business district when the regular route is directed around the city. They also use a green shield instead of the red and blue shield.&lt;ref name=&quot;aashto_ho1&quot; /&gt;

Interstate Highways and their rights-of-way are owned by the state in which they were built. The last federally owned portion of the Interstate System was the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] on the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Washington Capital Beltway]]. The new bridge was completed in 2009 and is collectively owned by Virginia and Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |date = n.d. |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |title = Interstate FAQ: Who owns it? |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.htm#question5 |access-date = March 4, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507121442/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.htm#question5 |archive-date = May 7, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the state department of transportation. However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.

About 70&amp;nbsp;percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the [[fuel tax]]es collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on [[toll highway]]s and bridges. The federal gasoline tax was first imposed in 1932 at one cent per gallon; during the Eisenhower administration, the [[Highway Trust Fund]], established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5&amp;nbsp;cents per gallon. Since 1993 the tax has remained at 18.4&amp;nbsp;cents per gallon.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Weingroff |first=Richard M. |title=When did the Federal Government begin collecting the gas tax? |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm |work=Ask the Rambler |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |access-date=June 29, 2011 |date=April 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703022304/https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other excise taxes related to highway travel also accumulated in the Highway Trust Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA&quot; /&gt; Initially, that fund was sufficient for the federal portion of building the Interstate system, built in the early years with &quot;10 cent dollars&quot;, from the perspective of the states, as the federal government paid 90% of the costs while the state paid 10%. The system grew more rapidly than the rate of the taxes on fuel and other aspects of driving (e. g., excise tax on tires).

The rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5&amp;nbsp;percent in 2007), as does about 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the state contribution. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2007/hf10.cfm |work=Highway Statistics 2007 |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |title=Funding For Highways and Disposition of Highway-User Revenues, All Units of Government, 2007 |date=January 3, 2012 |access-date=March 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117104528/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2007/hf10.cfm |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As decades passed in the 20th century and into the 21st century, the portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57&amp;nbsp;percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the [[mass transit system]]s in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in [[Connecticut]] (I‑95), [[Maryland]] (I‑95), [[Virginia]] (I‑95), and [[Kentucky]] (I‑65).
[[File:Bird's Eye 75 (31948398834).jpg|thumb|upright=0.667|A view of I-75 in Atlanta, Georgia, featuring HOV lanes running alongside the median]]
As American suburbs have expanded, the costs incurred in maintaining freeway infrastructure have also grown, leaving little in the way of funds for new Interstate construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Field |first=David |title=On 40th birthday, Interstates Face Expensive Midlife Crisis |work=Insight on the News |date=July 29, 1996 |pages=40–42 |issn=1051-4880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the proliferation of toll roads (turnpikes) as the new method of building limited-access highways in suburban areas.

About {{convert|2,900|mi|km}} of toll roads are included in the Interstate Highway System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Martin H. |last = Weiss |date = April 7, 2011 |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/howmany.cfm |title = How Many Interstate Programs Were There? |work = Highway History |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = March 10, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130607213511/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwayhistory/howmany.cfm |archive-date = June 7, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; While federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls on Interstates, many of the toll roads on the system were either completed or under construction when the Interstate Highway System was established. Since these highways provided logical connections to other parts of the system, they were designated as Interstate highways. [[United States Congress|Congress]] also decided that it was too costly to either build toll-free Interstates parallel to these toll roads, or directly repay all the bondholders who financed these facilities and remove the tolls. Thus, these toll roads were [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into the Interstate Highway System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Weingroff |first = Richard F. |date = August 2, 2011 |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |title = Why Does The Interstate System Include Toll Facilities? |work = Ask the Rambler |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = March 10, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518082124/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/tollroad.cfm |archive-date = May 18, 2013 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toll roads designated as Interstates (such as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]) were typically allowed to continue collecting tolls, but are generally ineligible to receive federal funds for maintenance and improvements. Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] (I-95) following the [[Mianus River Bridge]] collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway's construction bonds were paid off. In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from [[Interstate Highway standards]]. A notable example is the western approach to the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]] in [[Philadelphia]], where [[Interstate 676|I-676]] has a surface street section through a historic area.

Policies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed. The [[Federal Highway Administration]] has allowed some states to collect tolls on existing Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of [[Interstate 376|I-376]] included a section of [[Pennsylvania Route&amp;nbsp;60]] that was tolled by the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer toll facilities (like the tolled section of I-376, which was built in the early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the ''[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]'' in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow &quot;Toll&quot; sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/shsm_interim/index.htm |chapter = Interim Releases for New and Revised Signs |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = November 16, 2011 |title = Standard Highway Signs and Markings |access-date = March 10, 2012 |author = Federal Highway Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation passed in 2005 known as [[SAFETEA-LU]], encouraged states to construct new Interstate Highways through &quot;innovative financing&quot; methods. SAFETEA-LU facilitated states to pursue innovative financing by easing the restrictions on building interstates as toll roads, either through state agencies or through [[public–private partnership]]s. However, SAFETEA-LU left in place a prohibition of installing tolls on existing toll-free Interstates, and states wishing to toll such routes to finance upgrades and repairs must first seek approval from Congress.

===Chargeable and non-chargeable Interstate routes===
Interstate Highways financed with federal funds are known as &quot;chargeable&quot; Interstate routes, and are considered part of the {{convert|42000|mi|km|adj=on}} network of highways. Federal laws also allow &quot;non-chargeable&quot; Interstate routes, highways funded similarly to state and U.S. Highways to be signed as Interstates, if they both meet the Interstate Highway standards and are logical additions or connections to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|23|103(c)}}, Interstate System.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|99|599|Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additions fall under two categories: routes that already meet Interstate standards, and routes not yet upgraded to Interstate standards. Only routes that meet Interstate standards may be signed as Interstates once their proposed number is approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first = Tony |last = DeSimone |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/#s06 |title = FHWA Route Log and Finder List: Additional Designations |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |date = March 22, 2007 |access-date = January 4, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140805032748/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/#s06 |archive-date = August 5, 2014 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original design, the name of the state was displayed above the highway number, but in many states, this area is now left blank, allowing for the printing of larger and more-legible digits. Signs with the shield alone are placed periodically throughout each Interstate as [[reassurance marker]]s. These signs usually measure {{convert|36|in|cm}} high, and is {{convert|36|in|cm}} wide for two-digit Interstates or {{convert|45|in|cm}} for three-digit Interstates.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author = Federal Highway Administration |chapter-url = http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Guide.pdf |chapter = Guide Signs |title = Standard Highway Signs |edition = 2004 English |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |oclc = 69678912 |origyear = 2004 |date = May 10, 2005 |at = pp. 3-1 to 3-3 |access-date = February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interstate business loops and spurs use a special shield in which the red and blue are replaced with green, the word &quot;BUSINESS&quot; appears instead of &quot;INTERSTATE&quot;, and the word &quot;SPUR&quot; or &quot;LOOP&quot; usually appears above the number.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHS&quot; /&gt; The green shield is employed to mark the main route through a city's central business district, which intersects the associated Interstate at one (spur) or both (loop) ends of the business route.

Over time, the design of the Interstate shield has changed.

===Exit numbering===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}
The majority of Interstates have [[exit number]]s. Like other highways, Interstates feature [[Road signs in the United States#Guide|guide signs]] that list [[control cities]] to help direct drivers through interchanges and exits toward their desired destination. All [[Road signs in the United States|traffic sign]]s and [[lane]] markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.

For many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002—Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Daniel P. |last = Faigin |date = December 29, 2015 |url = http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |work = California Highways |title = Numbering Conventions: Post Miles |access-date = March 15, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190248/http://www.cahighways.org/num-postmiles.html |archive-date = January 31, 2017 |url-status = live }}{{self-published source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=March 2017}} In 2010–2011, the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] posted all new mile markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I‑90 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I‑94 section of the Tri‑State Tollway, which previously had matched the I‑294 section starting in the south at I‑80/I‑94/IL Route 394. The tollway also added exit number tabs to the exits.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Exit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On [[Interstate 19|I‑19]] in [[Arizona]], however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a [[metric system]] of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Zhang |first1 = Sarah |date = October 7, 2014 |title = An Arizona Highway Has Used the Metric System Since the 80s |url = https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |website = Gizmodo |access-date = February 25, 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103128/https://gizmodo.com/an-arizona-highway-has-used-the-metric-system-since-the-1643536691 |archive-date = February 25, 2019 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;  proximity to metric-using [[Mexico]] may also have been a factor, as I‑19 indirectly connects I‑10 to the [[Mexican Federal Highway]] system via surface streets in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north.

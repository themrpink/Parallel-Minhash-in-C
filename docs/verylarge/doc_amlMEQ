===Nelson murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a hold-up of a Brooklyn social club on December 28, 1972, ruling that the state had [[Speedy trial|delayed too long]] in bringing her to trial. Judge Starkey said, &quot;People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seigel&quot;&gt;Seigel, Max H.

===Attempted robbery dismissal===
On November 22, 1977, Shakur pleaded not guilty to an attempted armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the [[Statler Hilton Hotel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tribrob&quot;&gt;''Chicago Tribune'' (November 24, 1977). &quot;Black lib army 'chief' denies 1971 robbery&quot;, p.

==Imprisonment==

In this role, MacDowell's lines were dubbed by [[Glenn Close]] because her [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] was considered too pronounced for her role as an Englishwoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=November 7, 2011|title=...

A media report on 3 October 2013 said that Hird denied pleading guilty for a reduced charge as alleged by Demetriou. Hird's lawyer, Steven Amendola, asserted that the AFL withdrew all charges against Hird under the deeds of settlement that he and the club signed with the AFL. At the time of the media report, Hird was considering legal action against both the AFL and Demetriou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/james-hird-eyes-action-over-andrew-demetriou-guilt-claim/story-fnca0u4y-1226731908835?from=public_rss&amp;net_sub_uid=44933799# | title=James Hird eyes action over Andrew Demetriou guilt claim | date=3 October 2013 | accessdate=3 October 2013 | author=Adam Shand | newspaper=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essendon chairman Paul Little said that Hird would be wanted as the senior coach once his suspension was served and that he had been offered a two-year extension from 2015, which would have seen him coaching until the end of the 2016 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Return&quot; /&gt; However, Hird resigned after round 20 in August 2015, near the end of the season, with the team near the bottom of the ladder.

==Personal life==
Hird married Tania Poynton on 11 October 1997 and they have four children, a daughter and three sons. &lt;!-- Removed following detail about ages; Wikipedia guidelines state that minors should not be identified in this detail unless they are notable in their own right, even if it is interesting.

Hird's grandfather, the late [[Allan Hird, Sr.]], was a notable player for and president of the Essendon Football Club, and his father [[Allan Hird, Jr.]] had a brief playing career with Essendon.

Hird completed a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1998 and worked in that capacity as a consultant on the [[CityLink]] project.&lt;ref name='rmit-profile'&gt;{{Cite web|title=James Hird RMIT Alumni Profile|publisher=RMIT University|url=https://www.alumni.rmit.edu.au/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=467|accessdate=16 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930122455/https://www.alumni.rmit.edu.au/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=467 |archivedate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spent time working for a stockbroking firm and is an active partner in Gemba&lt;ref name='gemba'&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gemba Corporate Site|publisher=Gemba|url=http://www.gemba.com.au/|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a sports marketing and media consultancy firm based in Melbourne.

On 5 January 2017, Hird was taken to a private hospital following a [[drug overdose]] and was subsequently transferred to a specialist [[mental health care facility]] for further care and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/james-hird-in-care-after-drug-overdose/news-story/a4a3f11c6c546fe62a3c6147e558e3b9|title=James Hird in care after 'drug overdose'|work=The Australian|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''microsatellite''' is a tract of repetitive [[DNA]] in which certain [[Sequence motif|DNA motifs]] (ranging in length from one to six or more [[base pairs]]) are repeated, typically 5–50 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulcher2012&quot;/&gt; Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's [[genome]]. They have a higher [[mutation]] rate than other areas of DNA&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkmann-1998&quot;/&gt; leading to high [[genetic diversity]]. Microsatellites are often referred to as '''short tandem repeats''' ('''STRs''') by [[forensic genetics|forensic geneticists]] and in [[genetic genealogy]], or as '''simple sequence repeats''' ('''SSRs''') by plant geneticists.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Short+Tandem+Repeat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsatellites and their longer cousins, the [[minisatellite]]s, together are classified as [[variable number tandem repeat|VNTR]] (variable number of [[tandem repeat]]s) DNA. The name [[Satellite DNA|&quot;satellite&quot; DNA]] refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic DNA in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk DNA from accompanying &quot;satellite&quot; layers of repetitive DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kit1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kit S | title = Equilibrium sedimentation in density gradients of DNA preparations from animal tissues | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 711–6 | date = December 1961 | pmid = 14456492 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(61)80075-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are widely used for [[DNA profiling]] in [[Loss of heterozygosity#Detection|cancer diagnosis]], in [[kinship]] analysis (especially [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]]) and in forensic identification. They are also used in [[genetic linkage]] analysis to locate a gene or a mutation responsible for a given trait or disease. Microsatellites are also used in [[population genetics]] to measure levels of relatedness between subspecies, groups and individuals.

==History==
Although the first microsatellite was characterised in 1984 at the [[University of Leicester]] by Weller, [[Alec Jeffreys|Jeffreys]] and colleagues as a polymorphic GGAT repeat in the human myoglobin gene, the term &quot;microsatellite&quot; was introduced later, in 1989, by Litt and Luty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard 2008&quot;/&gt; The name [[Satellite DNA|&quot;satellite&quot; DNA]] refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic DNA in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk DNA from accompanying &quot;satellite&quot; layers of repetitive DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kit1&quot;/&gt; The increasing availability of DNA amplification by PCR at the beginning of the 1990s triggered a large number of studies using the amplification of microsatellites as genetic markers for forensic medicine, for paternity testing, and for positional cloning to find the gene underlying a trait or disease. Prominent early applications include the identifications by microsatellite genotyping of the eight-year-old skeletal remains of a British murder victim (Hagelberg et al. 1991), and of the Auschwitz concentration camp doctor [[Josef Mengele]] who escaped to South America following World War II (Jeffreys et al. 1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard 2008&quot;/&gt;

==Structures, locations, and functions==
A microsatellite is a tract of tandemly repeated (i.e. adjacent) DNA motifs that range in length from one to six or up to ten nucleotides (the exact definition and delineation to the longer minisatellites varies from author to author),&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulcher2012&quot;/&gt; and are typically repeated 5–50 times. For example, the sequence TATATATATA is a dinucleotide microsatellite, and GTCGTCGTCGTCGTC is a trinucleotide microsatellite (with A being [[Adenine]], G [[Guanine]], C [[Cytosine]], and T [[Thymine]]). Repeat units of four and five nucleotides are referred to as tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs, respectively. Most eukaryotes have microsatellites, with the notable exception of some yeast species. Microsatellites are distributed throughout the genome.&lt;ref name=&quot;King 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King DG, Soller M, Kashi Y |year=1997 |title=Evolutionary tuning knobs  | journal=Endeavour |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=36–40 |doi=10.1016/S0160-9327(97)01005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richard GF, Kerrest A, Dujon B | title = Comparative genomics and molecular dynamics of DNA repeats in eukaryotes | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 686–727 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19052325 | pmc = 2593564 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00011-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chistiakov DA, Hellemans B, Volckaert FA |date=2006-05-31|title=Microsatellites and their genomic distribution, evolution, function and applications: A review with special reference to fish genetics | journal=Aquaculture|volume=255|issue=1–4|pages=1–29|doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.11.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human genome for example contains 50,000–100,000 dinucleotide microsatellites, and lesser numbers of tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide microsatellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnpenny 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authors=Turnpenny P, Ellard S |date=2005 |title=Emery's Elements of Medical Genetics |url=https://archive.org/details/emeryselementsof0000turn_12ed |url-access=registration |edition=12th |location=London |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are located in non-coding parts of the human genome and therefore do not produce proteins, but they can also be located in regulatory regions and [[coding region]]s.

Microsatellites in non-coding regions may not have any specific function, and therefore might not be [[Natural selection|selected]] against; this allows them to accumulate mutations unhindered over the generations and gives rise to variability that can be used for DNA fingerprinting and identification purposes. Other microsatellites are located in regulatory flanking or intronic regions of genes, or directly in codons of genes&amp;nbsp;– microsatellite mutations in such cases can lead to phenotypic changes and diseases, notably in [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder|triplet expansion diseases]] such as [[fragile X syndrome]] and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson 2005&quot;/&gt;

The [[telomere]]s at the ends of the chromosomes, thought to be involved in [[ageing]]/[[senescence]], consist of repetitive DNA, with the hexanucleotide repeat motif TTAGGG in vertebrates. They are thus classified as [[minisatellite]]s. Similarly, insects have shorter repeat motifs in their telomeres that could arguably be considered microsatellites.

==Mutation mechanisms and mutation rates==
[[File:STR-Slippage Dr.Peter Forster.jpg|thumb|DNA strand slippage during replication of an STR locus. Boxes symbolize repetitive DNA units. Arrows indicate the direction in which a new DNA strand (white boxes) is being replicated from the template strand (black boxes). Three situations during DNA replication are depicted. (a) Replication of the STR locus has proceeded without a mutation. (b) Replication of the STR locus has led to a gain of one unit owing to a loop in the new strand; the aberrant loop is stabilized by flanking units complementary to the opposite strand. (c) Replication of the STR locus has led to a loss of one unit owing to a loop in the template strand. (Forster et al. 2015)]]
Unlike [[point mutations]], which affect only a single nucleotide, microsatellite mutations lead to the gain or loss of an entire repeat unit, and sometimes two or more repeats simultaneously. Thus, the [[mutation rate]] at microsatellite loci is expected to differ from other mutation rates, such as base substitution rates. The actual cause of mutations in microsatellites is debated.

One proposed cause of such length changes is replication slippage, caused by mismatches between DNA strands while being replicated during meiosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tautz 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tautz D | title = Simple sequences | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 832–7 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7888752 | doi = 10.1016/0959-437X(94)90067-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA polymerase]], the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage is more likely to occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klintschar 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klintschar M, Dauber EM, Ricci U, Cerri N, Immel UD, Kleiber M, Mayr WR | title = Haplotype studies support slippage as the mechanism of germline mutations in short tandem repeats | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 25 | issue = 20 | pages = 3344–8 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15490457 | doi = 10.1002/elps.200406069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forster 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forster P, Hohoff C, Dunkelmann B, Schürenkamp M, Pfeiffer H, Neuhuber F, Brinkmann B | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | journal = Proceedings.

===Microsatellite mutation rates===
Microsatellite mutation rates vary with base position relative to the microsatellite, repeat type, and base identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos-2010&quot;/&gt; Mutation rate rises specifically with repeat number, peaking around six to eight repeats and then decreasing again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos-2010&quot;/&gt; Increased heterozygosity in a population will also increase microsatellite mutation rates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos-2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amos W | title = Heterozygosity increases microsatellite mutation rate | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20150929 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26740567 | pmc = 4785931 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2015.0929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when there is a large length difference between alleles.

Direct estimates of microsatellite mutation rates have been made in numerous organisms, from insects to humans.

==Biological effects of microsatellite mutations==
Many microsatellites are located in non-coding DNA and are biologically silent. Others are located in regulatory or even coding DNA&amp;nbsp;– microsatellite mutations in such cases can lead to phenotypic changes and diseases.

An archaic form of splicing preserved in [[Zebrafish]] is known to use microsatellite sequences within intronic mRNA for the removal of introns in the absence of U2AF2 and other splicing machinery. It is theorized that these sequences form highly stable [[Cloverleaf model of tRNA|cloverleaf]] configurations that bring the 3' and 5' intron splice sites into close proximity, effectively replacing the [[spliceosome]]. This method of RNA splicing is believed to have diverged from human evolution at the formation of [[tetrapod]]s and to represent an artifact of an [[RNA world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin CL, Taggart AJ, Lim KH, Cygan KJ, Ferraris L, Creton R, Huang YT, Fairbrother WG | display-authors = 6 | title = RNA structure replaces the need for U2AF2 in splicing | journal = Genome Research | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26566657 | pmc = 4691745 | doi = 10.1101/gr.181008.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Microsatellites are used for assessing chromosomal DNA deletions in cancer diagnosis. Microsatellites are widely used for [[DNA profiling]], also known as &quot;genetic fingerprinting&quot;, of crime stains (in forensics) and of tissues (in transplant patients).  They are also widely used in [[kinship]] analysis (most commonly in paternity testing). Also, microsatellites are used for mapping locations  within the genome, specifically in [[genetic linkage]] analysis to locate a gene or a mutation responsible for a given trait or disease. As a special case of mapping, they can be used for studies of [[gene duplication]] or [[genetic deletion|deletion]]. Researchers use microsatellites in [[population genetics]] and in species conservation projects. Plant geneticists have proposed the use of microsatellites for [[marker assisted selection]] of desirable traits in plant breeding.

===Cancer diagnosis===
In [[tumour]] cells, whose controls on replication are damaged, microsatellites may be gained or lost at an especially high frequency during each round of [[mitosis]]. Hence a tumour cell line might show a different [[genetic fingerprint]] from that of the host tissue, and, especially in [[colorectal cancer]], might present with [[loss of heterozygosity]]. Microsatellites have therefore been routinely used in cancer diagnosis to assess tumour progression.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanTilborg2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Tilborg AA, Kompier LC, Lurkin I, Poort R, El Bouazzaoui S, van der Keur K, Zuiverloon T, Dyrskjot L, Orntoft TF, Roobol MJ, Zwarthoff EC | display-authors = 6 | title = Selection of microsatellite markers for bladder cancer diagnosis without the need for corresponding blood | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = e43345 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22927958 | pmc = 3425555 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0043345 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...743345V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sideris&amp;Papagrigoriadis2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sideris M, Papagrigoriadis S | title = Molecular biomarkers and classification models in the evaluation of the prognosis of colorectal cancer | journal = Anticancer Research | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 2061–8 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24778007 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boland1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boland CR, Thibodeau SN, Hamilton SR, Sidransky D, Eshleman JR, Burt RW, Meltzer SJ, Rodriguez-Bigas MA, Fodde R, Ranzani GN, Srivastava S | display-authors = 6 | title = A National Cancer Institute Workshop on Microsatellite Instability for cancer detection and familial predisposition: development of international criteria for the determination of microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 58 | issue = 22 | pages = 5248–57 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9823339 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used to follow up [[bone marrow transplant]] patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11669214&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Antin JH, Childs R, Filipovich AH, Giralt S, Mackinnon S, Spitzer T, Weisdorf D | title = Establishment of complete and mixed donor chimerism after allogeneic lymphohematopoietic transplantation: recommendations from a workshop at the 2001 Tandem Meetings of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 473–85 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11669214 | doi = 10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11669214 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microsatellites in use today for forensic analysis are all tetra- or penta-nucleotide repeats, as these give a high degree of error-free data while being short enough to survive degradation in non-ideal conditions.  Even shorter repeat sequences would tend to suffer from artifacts such as PCR stutter and preferential amplification, while longer repeat sequences would suffer more highly from environmental degradation and would amplify less well by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=DNA Profiling  |author=Angel Carracedo |url=http://www.interpol.int/public/Forensic/dna/conference/DNAProfiling01.asp#note41 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010927081712/http://www.interpol.int/public/forensic/dna/conference/dnaprofiling01.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-09-27 |access-date=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another forensic consideration is that the person's [[medical privacy]] must be respected, so that forensic STRs are chosen which are non-coding, do not influence gene regulation, and are not usually trinucleotide STRs which could be involved in [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder|triplet expansion diseases]] such as [[Huntington's disease]]. Forensic STR profiles are stored in DNA databanks such as the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD), the American [[CODIS]] or the Australian NCIDD.

===Kinship analysis (paternity testing)===
Autosomal microsatellites are widely used for [[DNA profiling]] in [[kinship]] analysis (most commonly in paternity testing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lászik A, Brinkmann B, Sótonyi P, Falus A | title = Automated fluorescent detection of a 10 loci multiplex for paternity testing | journal = Acta Biologica Hungarica | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–105 | date = 2000 | pmid = 10866366 | pmc =  | doi =  10.1007/BF03542970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paternally inherited [[Y-STR]]s (microsatellites on the [[Y chromosome]]) are often used in [[genealogical DNA test]]ing.

===Genetic linkage analysis===
During the 1990s and the first several years of this millennium, microsatellites were the workhorse genetic markers for genome-wide scans to locate any gene responsible for a given phenotype or disease, using [[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Segregation of genes (the &quot;First Law&quot;)|segregation]] observations across generations of a sampled pedigree. Although the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) platforms led to the era of the SNP for genome scans, microsatellites remain highly informative measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage lies in their greater allelic diversity than biallelic SNPs, thus microsatellites can differentiate alleles within a SNP-defined linkage disequilibrium block of interest. Thus, microsatellites have successfully led to discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gulcher2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gulcher J | title = Microsatellite markers for linkage and association studies | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2012 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–32 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22474656 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.top068510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ott J, Wang J, Leal SM | title = Genetic linkage analysis in the age of whole-genome sequencing | journal = Nature Reviews.

Microsatellites were popularized in [[population genetics]] during the 1990s because as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] became ubiquitous in laboratories researchers were able to design primers and amplify sets of microsatellites at low cost. Their uses are wide-ranging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Manel S, Schwartz MK, Luikart G, Taberlet P |date=2003-04-01|title=Landscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=18|issue=4|pages=189–197|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A microsatellite with a neutral evolutionary history makes it applicable for measuring or inferring [[Population bottleneck|bottlenecks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer CC, Neigel JE, Leberg PL | title = Experimental evaluation of the usefulness of microsatellite DNA for detecting demographic bottlenecks | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1517–28 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11050547 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-294x.2000.01031.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[local adaptation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen R | title = Molecular signatures of natural selection | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 197–218 | date = 2005-01-01 | pmid = 16285858 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.112420 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eaa404c54047f813c4aa8b73db9f7af85bd40121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the allelic [[fixation index]] (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slatkin M | title = A measure of population subdivision based on microsatellite allele frequencies | journal = Genetics | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 457–62 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7705646 | pmc = 1206343 | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/139/1/457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[population size]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohn MH, York EC, Kamradt DA, Haught G, Sauvajot RM, Wayne RK | title = Estimating population size by genotyping faeces | journal = Proceedings.

===Plant breeding===
[[Marker assisted selection]] or marker aided selection (MAS) is an indirect selection process where a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] of interest is selected based on a [[Biological marker|marker]] ([[Morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[biochemical]] or [[DNA]]/[[RNA]] variation) linked to a trait of interest (e.g. productivity, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and quality), rather than on the trait itself. Microsatellites have been proposed to be used as such markers to assist plant breeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miah2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miah G, Rafii MY, Ismail MR, Puteh AB, Rahim HA, Islam K, Latif MA | title = A review of microsatellite markers and their applications in rice breeding programs to improve blast disease resistance | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 22499–528 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24240810 | pmc = 3856076 | doi = 10.3390/ijms141122499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Analysis==
Repetitive DNA is not easily analysed by [[DNA sequencing|next generation DNA sequencing]] methods, which struggle with homopolymeric tracts. Therefore, microsatellites are normally analysed by conventional PCR amplification and amplicon size determination, sometimes followed by [[DNA sequencing|Sanger DNA sequencing]].

In forensics, the analysis is performed by extracting [[nuclear DNA]] from the cells of a sample of interest, then amplifying specific [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] regions of the extracted DNA by means of the [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Once these sequences have been amplified, they are resolved either through [[gel electrophoresis]] or [[capillary electrophoresis]], which will allow the analyst to determine how many repeats of the microsatellites sequence in question there are.  If the DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis, the DNA can be visualized either by [[silver stain]]ing (low sensitivity, safe, inexpensive), or an [[DNA intercalation|intercalating dye]] such as [[ethidium bromide]] (fairly sensitive, moderate health risks, inexpensive), or as most modern forensics labs use, [[Fluorescence|fluorescent dyes]] (highly sensitive, safe, expensive).&lt;ref name=&quot;nist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Technology for Resolving STR Alleles |url=http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/tech.htm |access-date=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments built to resolve microsatellite fragments by capillary electrophoresis also use fluorescent dyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist&quot;/&gt; Forensic profiles are stored in major databanks. The [[United Kingdom|British]] data base for microsatellite loci identification was originally based on the British [[SGM+]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The National DNA Database |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn258.pdf |access-date=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology Written Evidence  |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/115/115we20.htm |access-date=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; using 10 loci and a [[Amelogenin|sex marker]].

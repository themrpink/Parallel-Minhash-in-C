'''Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Kass''' (born September 21, 1982) is an American professional [[snowboarding|snowboarder]] who has competed at the Olympic level.

Kass was born in [[Pompton Plains, New Jersey|Pompton Plains]] section of [[Pequannock Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20060209nbc01 |title=NBC OLYMPICS AND &quot;APPRENTICE&quot; ANNOUNCE FIRST-EVER ONLINE VOTING TO CAST FOR APPRENTICE SIX |publisher=[[NBC]] |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in New Jersey where he began snowboarding at the age of twelve. At thirty-seven he moved to the gritty streets of Davis Shores, St. Augustine, FL and embellished the gangster style lifestyle that is North Florida. His home slopes are what are now known as [[Hidden Valley (New Jersey)|Hidden Valley]] and [[Mountain Creek]] ski resorts both located in the mountains of [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon Township]] and [[Highland Lakes, New Jersey|Highland Lakes]]. After several years of shredding around the Mid-Atlantic States, Kass entered into the [[Okemo Mountain]] School to focus more of his time on riding some of the better pipe and park in the East. In 2001, Danny broke out into what has become one of the most successful contest streaks in snowboarding with four US Open Championships, seven Winter X Games medals and two Olympic silver medals.

During the winter of 2006, Kass fought his way back from a slow start in the US Grand Prix Circuit to qualify for the Olympics in Torino for the second time in a row. And just like in 2002, Kass took home another silver medal with back-to-back 1080s and his signature smooth style.

Kass and his brother Matt Kass were the founders of [[Grenade Gloves]], which specializes in snowboarding gloves, accessories, and other extreme sporting gear.

Kass is one of the stars of ''The Adventures of Danny and The Dingo'' on Fuel TV.

The university system has five campuses, in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], [[Crookston, Minnesota|Crookston]], [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]], and [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]].  The university also operates several [[research]] facilities around the state, including some large parcels of land. The [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, Crookston, Duluth, Morris and Rochester campuses are accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html University of Minnesota Accreditation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505170140/http://academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html |date=2014-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other public system of [[higher education]] in the state is the larger [[Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system]] (Minnesota State System, previously MnSCU)
==Campuses==

The colors of the university, which are used system-wide, are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]].

===Twin Cities===
{{Main|University of Minnesota}}
[[File:University of Minnesota Twin Cities at night.jpg|thumb|Minneapolis Campus at night]]
The University of Minnesota Twin Cities (UMTC) is the largest with locations in [[Minneapolis]] and neighboring [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] (actually, the suburb of [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]]).  The locations are connected via a dedicated [[Bus rapid transit|bus transitway]]. The buildings on each campus are connected by a series of [[underground city|tunnel]]s and above-ground [[skyway]]s called [[The Gopher Way]].  The campus had 51,848 students enrolled for fall 2017, making it the sixth largest public university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of United States university campuses by enrollment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:University of Minnesota (1875).png|thumb|250px|left|The original University of Minnesota building in Minneapolis, 1875]]
The Minneapolis portion is the largest and has a number of colleges dedicated to a variety of subjects.  The Twin Cities campus located in Minneapolis can be further subdivided into the East Bank (main portion) and West Bank, as the [[Mississippi River]] flows through it.  Students become well-acquainted with the double-decker [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] that connects the two sections.  There are a number of distinguished graduate and professional schools on the Minneapolis campus, notably the [[University of Minnesota Law School]], [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], [[Carlson School of Management]], [[University of Minnesota School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], and [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]].  In addition, Minneapolis houses many research facilities such as [[The Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota|The Cancer Center]].

The Twin Cities campus located in St Paul is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences]], [[University of Minnesota College of Design]], and [[University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences]] programs, the [[University of Minnesota School of Social Work]], the College of Veterinary Medicine, and a variety of additional programs and student services. The [[Bell Museum of Natural History]] is also located on the campus in St. Paul.

The [[mascot]] for the Twin Cities campus is [[Goldy the Gopher]], and the sports teams are called the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]].  They participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I-A and in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Its women's [[ice hockey|hockey]] program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] and men's program competes in the Big Ten.

Among the graduates from this campus are two former U.S. Vice Presidents, [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Walter Mondale]], former [[NAACP]] president [[Roy Wilkins]], British [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], several [[Nobel prize]] winners, several athletes such as [[Ric Flair]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], [[Dave Winfield]], [[Patty Berg]], [[Brock Lesnar]], [[Curt Hennig]], [[Shelton Benjamin]], [[Bobby Jackson (basketball)|Bobby Jackson]] of the NBA, and composer [[Yanni]]. Folksinger [[Bob Dylan]] famously attended the University and was a part of its thriving &quot;West Bank&quot; music scene, but did not graduate.  A wide variety of [[medicine|medical]] and [[technology|technological]] innovations have taken place there as well. For instance, the [[Internet]] [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] was created at the Twin Cities campus.  A predecessor of sorts to the [[World Wide Web]], it was named after the school mascot.

Campus media includes the ''[[Minnesota Daily]]'' newspaper, ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', and [[Radio K|770 Radio K]] (KUOM), an [[AM band|AM]] [[radio station]] that is probably the oldest in the state.

===Crookston===
The [[University of Minnesota Crookston]] (UMC) joined the university system in 1966. At that time it was known as the University of Minnesota Technical Institute at Crookston.  Since 1993 the Crookston campus has offered bachelor's degrees, and it has grown to be a more comprehensive regional college campus.  It is known for its focus on experiential learning and technology, and through fees each student is provided a laptop computer as part of their experience. The campus mascot is Regal the Eagle, and the athletics teams are known as the Golden Eagles.

===Duluth===
The [[University of Minnesota Duluth]] (UMD) became part of the system in 1947, though the campus has a history stretching back to 1895 when it was formed as the Normal School at Duluth. UMD integrates liberal education, research, creative activity, and public engagement and prepares students to thrive as lifelong learners and globally engaged citizens.

Its men's hockey program competes in the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]] and its women's hockey program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]. UMD baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's track and field, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball are [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] teams. Their teams are nicknamed [[Bulldog]]s. and their mascot is Champ.

Among the graduates from UMD are former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota [[Yvonne Prettner Solon]], current Duluth mayor [[Emily Larson]], and former Duluth mayor [[Don Ness]]. [[Brian Kobilka]] received the 2012 Nobel Prize in chemistry. UMD has produced numerous professional hockey players including [[John Harrington (ice hockey)|John Harrington]] and [[Mark Pavelich]] from the 1980 [[Miracle on Ice]] Olympic hockey team, and NHL Hall of Famer [[Brett Hull]].

Campus media includes The Bark newspaper and the [[KUMD-FM]] radio station.

===Morris===
The [[University of Minnesota Morris]] (UMM) joined the system in 1960. UMN Morris is a public liberal arts college where students work closely with faculty and mentors to shape an education that prepares them for challenging graduate programs, productive careers, and deep civic engagement.

UMN Morris provides opportunities for students to grow intellectually, engage in community, experience environmental stewardship, and celebrate diversity. The campus offers 34 majors, 35 minors, and 13 licensure areas, along with the option to create one's own major. With a student-to-faculty ratio of 13:1, students are able to engage in undergraduate research and internships with faculty members. One in five students also participates in NCAA Division III Intercollegiate Athletics as a Cougar athlete.

With tuition a quarter of Minnesota’s most expensive private school and 96% of incoming students receiving financial aid, UMN Morris students graduate with the lowest student loan debt in the University of Minnesota system.

===Rochester===
The [[University of Minnesota Rochester]] (UMR) is the public undergraduate health sciences university that challenges and assists students to make a lifelong commitment to the comprehensive improvement of health care through research and hands-on clinical practice. UMR is the newest campus of the University of Minnesota system, having been formally established in December 2006 (although the University of Minnesota has offered classes in Rochester as a satellite site since as early as 1966). UMR has no [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] athletic teams, but it does have a mascot, the Rochester Raptor.

UMR, located in University Square in downtown [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], is neighbor to world-renowned [[Mayo Clinic]] and attracts highly motivated and academically prepared students who seek a rigorous education and exceptional professional preparation. In UMR's dynamic academic community, students:

* Engage in small, highly interactive classes.

* Connect with accomplished professors who are invested in their students’ success.

* Apply what they learn in a variety of experiences outside the classroom.

* And expand their understanding and perspectives.

As a result, UMR graduates are prepared to take on the grand health care challenges of the 21st century.

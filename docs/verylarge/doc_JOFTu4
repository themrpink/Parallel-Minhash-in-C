'''Elizabeth Woodville''' (also spelled '''Wydville''', '''Wydeville''', or '''Widvile'''&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Although spelling of the family name is usually modernised to &quot;Woodville&quot;, it was spelled &quot;Wydeville&quot; in contemporary publications by Caxton, but her tomb at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle is inscribed thus: &quot;Edward IV and his Queen Elizabeth Widvile&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;) (c. 1437&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_&quot;&gt;Karen Lindsey, ''Divorced, Beheaded, Survived'', xviii, Perseus Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; – 8 June 1492) was [[queen consort of England|queen of England]] as the spouse of [[King Edward IV]] from 1464 until his death in 1483.

At the time of her birth, her family was of [[Landed gentry|middle rank]] in the English social hierarchy. Her mother, [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], had previously been an aunt-by-marriage to [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. Elizabeth's first marriage was to a minor supporter of the [[House of Lancaster]], Sir [[John Grey of Groby]]. He died at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]], leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two sons.

Her second marriage to Edward IV was a [[cause célèbre]] of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty and lack of great estates. Edward was the first king of England since the [[Norman Conquest]] to marry one of his subjects,&lt;ref&gt;A Complete History of England with the Lives of all the Kings and Queens thereof; London, 1706. p486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.org/details/completehistoryo02kenn |title=A complete history of England: with the lives of all the kings and queens thereof; from the earliest account of time, to the death of His late Majesty King William III.

This hostility turned into open discord between King Edward and Warwick, leading to a battle of wills that finally resulted in Warwick switching allegiance to the Lancastrian cause, and to the execution of Elizabeth's father [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard Woodville]] in 1469.

After the death of her husband in 1483, Elizabeth remained politically influential even after her son, briefly proclaimed King [[Edward V of England]], was deposed by her brother-in-law, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. Edward and his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York|Richard]] [[Princes in the Tower|both disappeared]] soon afterward, and are presumed to have been murdered. Elizabeth subsequently played an important role in securing the accession of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1485. Henry married her daughter [[Elizabeth of York]], ended the [[Wars of the Roses]], and established the Tudor dynasty. Through her daughter, Elizabeth was a grandmother of the future [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Elizabeth was forced to yield pre-eminence to Henry VII's mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]; her influence on events in these years, and her eventual departure from court into retirement, remain obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud_BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=political+role+of+elizabeth+woodville&amp;pg=PA135 |title=Women in Medieval England |isbn=9780719040177 |last1=Jewell |first1=Helen M. |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, David, ''Elizabeth Woodville: Mother of the Princes in the Tower''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and first marriage==

Elizabeth Woodville was born about 1437, possibly in October,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;No record of Elizabeth's birth survives. She was the product of a secret marriage between [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard Woodville]], a prominent English gentleman, and [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], the aristocratic eldest daughter of [[Peter I of Luxembourg]], Count of [[County of Saint-Pol|Saint-Pol]], [[Conversano]] and [[County of Brienne|Brienne]]. The marriage caused a scandal when it came to public notice and the couple were fined, and, on 24 October 1437, pardoned for marrying without royal permission. David Baldwin conjectures that the pardon coincided with the birth of Elizabeth Woodville, the couple's firstborn child. See Baldwin, David, ''Elizabeth Woodville: The Mother of the Princes in the Tower''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxforddnb&gt;{{cite ODNB |last=Hicks |first=Michael |title=Elizabeth (c.1437–1492) |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8634 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8634 |accessdate=25 September 2010 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Grafton Regis]], Northamptonshire. She was the firstborn child of a socially unequal marriage between [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Sir Richard Woodville]] and [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], which briefly scandalised the English court. The Woodvilles, though an old and respectable family, were [[gentry]] rather than noble, a [[Landed gentry|landed]] and wealthy family that had previously produced commissioners of the peace, sheriffs, and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], rather than peers of the realm; Elizabeth's mother, in contrast, was the widow of [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|the Duke of Bedford]], uncle of King [[Henry VI of England]].

In about 1452, Elizabeth Woodville married Sir [[John Grey of Groby]], the heir to the [[Baron Ferrers of Groby|Barony Ferrers of Groby]]. He was killed at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] in 1461, fighting for the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] cause. This would become a source of irony, since Elizabeth's future husband Edward IV was the [[House of York|Yorkist]] claimant to the throne. Elizabeth Woodville's two sons from this first marriage were [[Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset|Thomas]] (later [[Marquess of Dorset]]) and [[Richard Grey|Richard]].

Elizabeth Woodville was called &quot;the most beautiful woman in the Island of Britain&quot; with &quot;heavy-lidded eyes like those of a dragon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_a&quot;&gt;Jane Bingham, ''The Cotswolds: A Cultural History'', (Oxford University Press, 2009), 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen consort==

[[File:EdwardIV.JPG|thumb|Elizabeth as queen, with Edward and their [[Edward V|oldest son]]. From ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers]]'', [[Lambeth Palace Library|Lambeth Palace]].]]
Edward IV had many mistresses, the best known of them being [[Jane Shore]], and he did not have a reputation for fidelity. His marriage to the widowed Elizabeth Woodville took place secretly and, though the date is not known, it is traditionally said to have taken place at her family home in [[Northamptonshire]] on 1 May 1464.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_b&quot;&gt;Robert Fabian, ''The New Chronicles of England and France'', ed. Henry Ellis (London: Rivington, 1811), 654; &quot;Hearne’s Fragment of an Old Chronicle, from 1460–1470,&quot; The Chronicles of the White Rose of York. (London: James Bohn, 1845), 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the bride's mother and two ladies were in attendance. Edward married her just over three years after he had assumed the English throne in the wake of his overwhelming victory over the Lancastrians, at the [[Battle of Towton]], which resulted in the displacement of King Henry VI. Elizabeth Woodville was crowned queen on 26 May 1465, the Sunday after [[Ascension Day]].

In the early years of his reign, Edward IV's governance of England was dependent upon a small circle of supporters, most notably his cousin, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]]. At around the time of Edward IV's secret marriage, Warwick was negotiating an alliance with France in an effort to thwart a similar arrangement being made by his sworn enemy [[Margaret of Anjou]], wife of the deposed Henry VI. The plan was that Edward IV should marry a French princess. When his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, who was both a [[commoner]] and from a family of Lancastrian supporters became public, Warwick was both embarrassed and offended, and his relationship with Edward IV never recovered. The match was also badly received by the [[Privy Council]], who according to [[Jean de Waurin]] told Edward with great frankness that &quot;he must know that she was no wife for a prince such as himself&quot;.

With the arrival on the scene of the new queen came many relatives, some of whom married into the most notable families in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;Ralph A. Griffiths, &quot;The Court during the Wars of the Roses&quot;. In ''Princes Patronage and the Nobility: The Court at the Beginning of the Modern Age, cc. 1450–1650.'' Edited by Ronald G. Asch and Adolf M. Birke. New York: Oxford University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-19-920502-7}}. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of her sisters married the sons of the earls of Kent, Essex and Pembroke. Another sister, [[Catherine Woodville, Duchess of Buckingham and Bedford|Catherine Woodville]], married the queen's 11-year-old ward [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], who later joined Edward IV's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], in opposition to the Woodvilles after the death of Edward IV.  Elizabeth's 20-year-old brother [[John Woodville|John]] married [[Lady Katherine Neville|Katherine, Duchess of Norfolk]]. The Duchess had been widowed three times and was probably in her sixties, so that the marriage created a scandal at court.  Elizabeth's son from her first marriage, Thomas Grey, married [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington]].

When Elizabeth Woodville's relatives, especially her brother [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]], began to challenge Warwick's pre-eminence in English political society, Warwick conspired with his son-in-law [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]], the king's younger brother. One of his followers accused Elizabeth Woodville's mother, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, of practising witchcraft. She was acquitted the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_d&quot;&gt;Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1467–77, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick and Clarence twice rose in revolt and then fled to France. Warwick formed an uneasy alliance with the Lancastrian Queen Margaret of Anjou and restored her husband Henry VI to the throne in 1470. But the following year, Edward IV, returned from exile and defeated Warwick at the [[Battle of Barnet]], and the Lancastrians at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]]. Henry VI was killed soon afterwards.

Following her husband's temporary fall from power, Elizabeth Woodville sought [[sanctuary]] in [[Westminster Abbey]], where she gave birth to a son, Edward (later King [[Edward V of England]]). Her marriage to Edward IV produced a total of ten children, including another son, [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who would later join his brother as one of the [[Princes in the Tower]].&lt;ref name=oxforddnb /&gt; Five daughters also lived to adulthood.

Elizabeth Woodville engaged in acts of Christian piety in keeping with conventional expectations of a medieval queen consort. Her acts included making pilgrimages, obtaining a papal indulgence for those who knelt and said the [[Angelus]] three times per day, and founding the chapel of [[St. Erasmus]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_e&quot;&gt;Sutton and Visser-Fuchs, &quot;A 'Most Benevolent Queen;'&quot;Laynesmith, pp. 111, 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen dowager==
Following Edward IV's sudden death, possibly from pneumonia, in April 1483, Elizabeth Woodville became queen dowager. Her young son, [[Edward V]], became king, with his uncle, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], acting as [[Lord Protector]]. In response to the Woodvilles' attempt to monopolise power, Gloucester quickly moved to take control of the young king and had the king's uncle Earl Rivers and half-brother [[Richard Grey]], son to Elizabeth, arrested. The young king was transferred to the [[Tower of London]] to await the coronation. With her younger son and daughters, Elizabeth again sought sanctuary. [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]], the late king's leading supporter in London, initially endorsed Gloucester's actions, but Gloucester then accused him of conspiring with Elizabeth Woodville against him. Hastings was [[Summary execution|summarily executed]]. Whether any such conspiracy really occurred is not known.&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Wood, &quot;Richard III, William, Lord Hastings and Friday the Thirteenth&quot;, in R. A. Griffiths and J. Sherborne (eds.), ''Kings and Nobles in the Later Middle Ages'', New York, 1986, 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard accused Elizabeth of plotting to &quot;murder and utterly destroy&quot; him.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ross, ''Richard III'', University of California Press, 1981 p81.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1483, Gloucester had Elizabeth Woodville's son Richard Grey and brother [[Anthony_Woodville,_2nd_Earl_Rivers|Anthony, Earl Rivers]], executed in [[Pontefract Castle]], Yorkshire. By an act of Parliament, the ''[[Titulus Regius]]'' (1 Ric. III), it was declared that Edward IV's children with Elizabeth were [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|illegitimate]] on the grounds that Edward IV had a precontract with the widow [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]], which was considered a legally binding contract that rendered any other marriage contract invalid.  One source, the Burgundian chronicler [[Philippe de Commines]], says that [[Robert Stillington]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], carried out an engagement ceremony between Edward IV and Lady Eleanor.&lt;ref&gt;Philipe de Commines, ''The memoirs of Philip de Commines, lord of Argenton'', Volume 1, H.G. Bohn, 1855, pp.396–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The act also contained charges of witchcraft against Elizabeth, but gave no details and the charges had no further repercussions. As a consequence, the Duke of Gloucester and Lord Protector was offered the throne and became King Richard III. Edward V, who was no longer king, and his brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], remained in the [[Tower of London]]. There are no recorded sightings of them after the summer of 1483.

==Life under Richard III==

Now referred to as Dame Elizabeth Grey,&lt;ref name=oxforddnb /&gt; she, with [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] (a former close ally of Richard III and now probably seeking the throne for himself) now allied themselves with Lady [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Stanley]] (née [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]]) and espoused the cause of Margaret's son [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], a great-great-great-grandson of [[King Edward III]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_g&quot;&gt;Genealogical Tables in Morgan, (1988), p. 709.&lt;/ref&gt; the closest male heir of the Lancastrian claim to the throne with any degree of validity.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Henry Tudor's claim to the throne was weak, owing to a declaration of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] that barred the accession to the throne of any heirs of the legitimised offspring of his father [[John of Gaunt]] by his third wife Katherine Swynford. The original act legitimizing the children of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford passed by Parliament and the bull issued by the Pope in the matter legitimised them fully, making questionable the legality of Henry IV's declaration.&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen his claim and unite the two feuding noble houses, Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort agreed that the latter's son should marry the former's eldest daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], who upon the death of her brothers became the heiress of the House of York. Henry Tudor agreed to this plan and in December 1483 publicly swore an oath to that effect in the cathedral in [[Rennes]], France. A month earlier, an uprising in his favour, led by Buckingham, had been crushed.

Richard III's first Parliament of January 1484 stripped Elizabeth of all the lands given to her during Edward IV's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partyparcel.co.uk/#annullment_elizabeth|work=Rotuli Parliamentorum A.D. 1483 1 Richard III Cap XV|title=Parliamentary Rolls Richard III|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901080051/http://www.partyparcel.co.uk/#annullment_elizabeth|archive-date=1 September 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1484, Elizabeth and her daughters came out of sanctuary after Richard III publicly swore an oath that her daughters would not be harmed or molested and that they would not be imprisoned in the Tower of London or in any other prison. He also promised to provide them with marriage portions and to marry them to &quot;gentlemen born&quot;. The family returned to Court, apparently reconciled to Richard III. After the death of Richard III's wife [[Anne Neville]], in March 1485, rumours arose that the newly widowed king was going to marry his beautiful and young niece Elizabeth of York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_h&quot;&gt;[http://www.r3.org/basics/basic8.html Richard III and Yorkist History Server] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709203718/http://www.r3.org/basics/basic8.html |date=9 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life under Henry VII==

In 1485, Henry Tudor invaded England and defeated Richard III at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. As King, Henry VII married [[Elizabeth of York]] and had the [[Titulus Regius]] revoked and all found copies destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotuli Parliamentorum A.D. 1485 1 Henry VII – Annullment of Richard III's Titulus Regius|url=http://partyparcel.co.uk/information/price-guarantee.html#annullment|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902193242/http://www.partyparcel.co.uk/information/price-guarantee.html#annullment|archive-date=2 September 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth Woodville was accorded the title and honours of a queen [[dowager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotuli Parliamentorum A.D. 1485 1 Henry VII – Restitution of Elizabeth Queen of Edward IV|url=http://partyparcel.co.uk/information/price-guarantee.html#restitution_elizabeth|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902193242/http://www.partyparcel.co.uk/information/price-guarantee.html#restitution_elizabeth|archive-date=2 September 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars differ about why Dowager Queen Elizabeth spent the last five years of her life living at [[Bermondsey Abbey]], to which she retired on 12 February 1487. Among her modern biographers, David Baldwin believes that Henry VII forced her retreat from the Court, while Arlene Okerlund presents evidence from July 1486 that she was already planning her retirement from court to live a religious, contemplative life at Bermondsey Abbey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_i&quot;&gt;Arlene Okerlund, ''Elizabeth: England's Slandered Queen''. Stroud: Tempus, 2006, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is that her retreat to Bermondsey was forced on her because she was in some way involved in the 1487 Yorkist rebellion of [[Lambert Simnel]], or at least was seen as a potential ally of the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Michael, ''Lambert Simnel and the Battle of Stoke'', New York, St. Martin's Press, 1987, pp.42; 51; Elston, Timothy, &quot;Widowed Princess or Neglected Queen&quot; in Levin &amp; Bucholz (eds), ''Queens and Power in Medieval and Early Modern England'', University of Nebraska Press, 2009, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Bermondsey Abbey, Elizabeth was treated with the respect due to a dowager queen. She lived a regal life on a pension of £400 and received small gifts from Henry VII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CcR5DAAAQBAJ&amp;q=At+Bermondsey+Abbey,+Elizabeth+was+treated+with+all+the+respect+due+to+a+queen+dowager.+She+lived+a+regal+life+and+received+a+pension+of+%C2%A3400+and+small+gifts+from+Henry+VII&amp;pg=PT206|title=Henry VII: The Maligned Tudor King|last=Breverton|first=Terry|date=15 May 2016|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=9781445646060|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was present at the birth of her granddaughter [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]] at [[Westminster Palace]] in November 1489 and at the birth of her grandson, the future [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], at [[Greenwich Palace]] in June 1491. Her daughter [[Elizabeth of York|Queen Elizabeth]] visited her on occasion at Bermondsey, although another one of her other daughters, [[Cecily of York]], visited her more often.

Henry VII briefly contemplated marrying his mother-in-law to King [[James III of Scotland]], when James III's wife, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]], died in 1486.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_j&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Margaret_of_Denmark.aspx#2-1O110:MargaretofDenmark-full |title=Margaret of Denmark Facts, information, pictures |website=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However James III was killed in battle in 1488.

Elizabeth Woodville died at Bermondsey Abbey, on 8 June 1492.&lt;ref name=oxforddnb/&gt; With the exception of the queen, who was awaiting the birth of her fourth child, and [[Cecily of York]], her daughters attended the funeral at Windsor Castle; [[Anne of York (daughter of Edward IV)|Anne of York]] (the future wife of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]]), [[Catherine of York]] (the future Countess of Devon) and [[Bridget of York]] (a nun at [[Dartford Priory]]). Elizabeth's will specified a simple ceremony.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lay&quot;&gt;J. L. Laynesmith, ''The Last Medieval Queens: English Queenship 1445–1503'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2004, pp.127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving accounts of her funeral on 12 June 1492 suggest that at least one source &quot;clearly felt that a queen's funeral should have been more splendid&quot; and may have objected that &quot;Henry VII had not been fit to arrange a more queenly funeral for his mother-in-law&quot;, although simplicity was the queen dowager's own wish.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lay&quot;/&gt; A letter discovered in 2019, written in 1511 by Andrea Badoer, the Venetian ambassador in London, suggests that she had died of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], which would explain the haste and lack of public ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/25/white-queen-died-of-plague-claims-letter-found-in-national-archives |title='White Queen' died of plague, claims letter found in National Archives |newspaper=The Guardian  |author=Alison Flood |date= 25 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roger |first1=Euan C. |date=2019 |title=To Be Shut Up: New Evidence for the Development of Quarantine Regulations in Early-Tudor England |journal=Social History of Medicine |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1093/shm/hkz031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth was laid to rest in the same [[chantry]] as her husband King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]] in [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref name=oxforddnb /&gt;

=== Fiction ===

Edward IV's love for his wife is celebrated in sonnet 75 of [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/astrophel-and-stella-75|title=Astrophel and Stella: 75|work=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; (written by 1586, first pub. 1591).

She appears in two of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays: ''[[Henry VI Part 3]]'' (written by 1592), in which she is a fairly minor character, and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' (written approx. 1592), where she has a central role. Shakespeare portrays Elizabeth as a proud and alluring woman in ''Henry VI Part 3''. By ''Richard III,'' she is careworn from having to defend herself against detractors in the court, including her titular brother-in-law Richard. She is one of Richard's cleverest opponents, as she sees through him from the beginning, but she is also melodramatic and self-pitying. Although most modern editions of ''Henry VI Part 3'' and ''Richard III'' call her &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in the stage directions, the original Shakespearean Folio never actually refer to her by name, instead calling her first &quot;Lady Grey&quot; and later simply &quot;Queen.&quot;

Vegetarian and vegan burgers can be formed from a [[meat analogue]], a meat substitute such as [[tofu]], [[textured vegetable protein|TVP]], [[wheat gluten (food)|seitan]] (wheat gluten), [[quorn (food product)|quorn]], beans, grains or an assortment of vegetables, ground up and mashed into patties.

Vegetable patties have existed in various [[Eurasian]] cuisines for millennia, and are a commonplace item in [[Indian cuisine]].

{{Steak}}

A '''steak burger''' is marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Butters, &quot;Trademark linguistics: Trademarks: Language that one owns&quot;, in Malcolm Coulthard, Alison Johnson, ''The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Motz, ''Hamburger America'', 2011 {{isbn|0762440708}}, p. 17, 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Riggs, ''Encyclopedia of major marketing campaigns'', '''2''':456&lt;/ref&gt; or, in Australia, a [[sandwich]] containing a [[steak]].

Steak burgers are first mentioned in the 1920s. Like other hamburgers, they may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings.

Use of the term &quot;steakburger&quot; dates to the 1920s in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt; In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. &quot;Gus&quot; Belt, the founder of [[Steak 'n Shake]], devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a &quot;steakburger&quot; to customers at the company's first location in [[Normal, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LR66&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq80iaT38k4C&amp;pg=PA210|title=Legendary Route 66|publisher=|page=210|isbn=9781616731236|last1=Michael Karl Witzel|first1=Gyvel Young-Witzel|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of [[T-bone steak]] and [[sirloin steak]] in its preparation.&lt;ref name=&quot;LR66&quot;/&gt; Steak burgers are a primary menu item at [[Steak 'n Shake]] restaurants,&lt;ref name=&quot;LR66&quot;/&gt; and the company's registered [[trademark]]s included &quot;original steakburger&quot; and &quot;famous for steakburgers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFDLD&quot;/&gt; Steak 'n Shake's &quot;Prime Steakburgers&quot; are now made of [[Beef carcass classification|choice grade]] brisket and chuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.steaknshake.com/|title=Steak n Shake &amp;#124; Steakburger &amp; Homemade Milkshakes|website=www.steaknshake.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hamburger is considered a national dish of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=September 13, 2011|title=Top 10 National Dishes -- National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/|access-date=August 8, 2020|website=Travel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], burgers may be classified as two main types: fast food hamburgers and individually prepared burgers made in homes and [[restaurant]]s. The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[onion]], and often sliced [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] (or pickle relish). [[French fries]] often accompany the burger. [[Cheese]] (usually [[processed cheese|processed cheese slices]] but often [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss]], [[pepper jack]], or [[blue cheese|blue]]), either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is generally an option.

[[Condiment]]s might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side including [[ketchup]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[mayonnaise]], [[relish]], salad dressings and [[barbecue sauce]].

Other toppings can include [[bacon]], [[avocado]] or [[guacamole]], sliced sautéed [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], cheese sauce, [[chili con carne|chili]] (usually without [[bean]]s), [[fried egg]], [[scrambled egg]], [[feta cheese]], [[blue cheese]], [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[pineapple]], [[jalapeño]]s and other kinds of [[chili pepper]]s, [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]], slices of [[Ham (meat)|ham]] or [[Bologna sausage|bologna]], [[pastrami]] or [[teriyaki]]-seasoned beef, [[tartar sauce]], [[french fries]], [[onion ring]]s or [[potato chip]]s.

*Standard toppings on hamburgers may depend upon location, particularly at restaurants that are not national or regional franchises.
*Restaurants may offer hamburgers with multiple meat patties. The most common variants are double and triple hamburgers, but California-based burger chain [[In-N-Out]] once sold a sandwich with one hundred patties, called a &quot;100x100.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;100x100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Does A 100x100 In-N-Out Cheeseburger Cost?|url=http://robertkaplinsky.com/work/in-n-out-100-x-100/|website=Robert Kaplinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pastrami burgers may be served in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John T. Edge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/dining/29united.html |title=Pastrami Meets the Patty in Utah |work=The New York Times |date=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[patty melt]] consists of a patty, [[Sautéing|sautéed]] onions and cheese between two slices of [[rye bread]]. The sandwich is then buttered and fried.
* A [[slider (sandwich)|slider]] is a very small square hamburger patty, served on an equally small bun and usually sprinkled with diced onions. According to the earliest citations, the name originated aboard U.S. Navy ships, due to the manner in which greasy burgers slid across the galley grill as the ship pitched and rolled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/slider_or_slyder_mini_hamburger/ Slider or Slyder (mini-hamburger)].

''Houston Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions claim the term &quot;slider&quot; originated from the hamburgers served by flight line galleys at military airfields, which were so greasy they slid right through you; or because their small size allows them to &quot;slide&quot; right down your throat in one or two bites.
* In [[Alberta]], Canada a &quot;kubie burger&quot; is a hamburger made with a pressed Ukrainian sausage ([[kubasa]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Oxford Dictionary has headwords for the Canadianisms &quot;[[kubasa]]&quot;, &quot;kubie&quot; (as a [[hot dog]]), and &quot;kubie burger&quot;, the latter two being specific to [[Alberta]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Minnesota]], a &quot;[[Jucy Lucy|Juicy Lucy]]&quot; (also spelled &quot;Jucy Lucy&quot;), is a hamburger having cheese inside the meat patty rather than on top. A piece of cheese is surrounded by raw meat and cooked until it melts, resulting in a molten core of cheese within the patty. This scalding hot cheese tends to gush out at the first bite, so servers frequently instruct customers to let the sandwich cool for a few minutes before consumption.
* A [[low carb]] burger is a hamburger served without a bun and replaced with large slices of lettuce with mayonnaise or mustard being the sauces primarily used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlsjr.com/menu/charbroiled-burgers/the-low-carb-six-dollar-burger/ The Low Carb Six Dollar Burger | Carl's Jr. Menu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002161407/http://www.carlsjr.com/menu/charbroiled-burgers/the-low-carb-six-dollar-burger/ |date=October 2, 2010 }}.

=== France ===

In 2012, according to a study by the NDP cabinet, the French consume 14 hamburgers in restaurants per year per person, placing them fourth in the world and second in Europe, just behind the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Français, deuxièmes plus gros consommateurs de hamburgers en Europe|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/les-francais-deuxiemes-plus-gros-consommateurs-de-hamburgers-en-europe_1138906.html|author=Audrey Parfait|website=www.lexpress.fr|date=July 16, 2012|publication-date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by Gira Conseil on the consumption of hamburger in France in 2013, 75% of traditional French restaurants offer at least one hamburger on their menu and for a third of these restaurants, it has become the leader in the range of dishes, ahead of rib steaks, grills or fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le burger détrône le sandwich jambon-beurre|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/02/06/1812088-le-burger-detrone-le-sandwich-jambon-beurre.html|website=www.ladepeche.fr|date=February 6, 2014|publication-date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

French chefs have adapted the hamburger according to the rules of their traditional cuisine: baker's bread, minced butcher's meat and fresh local products, handmade french fries and traditional homemade sauces... The aim is to prepare a dish of equivalent quality to the traditional dishes of [[French cuisine]].

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], burgers (called ''hamburguesas'') are served with [[ham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Schwartz |title=Uncovering Mexico: Best of times, worst of times: Celebrating the 100th |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/mexico/entries/2007/08/27/im_sure_youve_all_been_1.html |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |newspaper=[[Statesman.com]] |date=August 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102102321/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/mexico/entries/2007/08/27/im_sure_youve_all_been_1.html |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and slices of [[American cheese]] fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include [[avocado]], jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a &quot;Hawaiian hamburger&quot;.

Some restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others also replace the ground patty with sirloin, [[Al pastor]] meat, [[barbacoa]] or a fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, as well as global chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the [[High Street]] is dominated by the same big two chains as in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;— McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland the food outlet [[Supermacs]] is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu. In Ireland, [[Abrakebabra]] (started out selling kebabs) and [[Eddie Rocket's]] are also major chains.

An original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy]], originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style [[french fries|chips]], accompanied by [[cutlery]] and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |title=Wimpy History |work=wimpy.uk.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122138/http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, [[Grand Metropolitan]]. A [[management buyout]] in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.

Hamburgers are also available from mobile [[kiosk]]s, commonly known as “burger vans&quot;, particularly at outdoor events such as [[football (soccer)|football]] matches. Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad&amp;nbsp;— only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard or brown sauce.

Chip shops, particularly in the West Midlands and North-East of England, Scotland and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers. This is where the burger patty, by itself, is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.

Hamburgers and [[veggie burger]]s served with chips and salad, are standard [[pub grub]] menu items. Many pubs specialize in &quot;gourmet&quot; burgers. These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with items such as blue cheese, brie, avocado, anchovy mayonnaise, et cetera. Some British [[pub]]s serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including [[venison]] burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), [[bison]] burgers, [[ostrich]] burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even [[kangaroo]] burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served in a similar way to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.

In the early 21st century &quot;premium&quot; hamburger chain and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often [[Organic food|organic]], usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,,1676523,00.html|title=Camembert with that, sir? | location=London | first=Josh| last=Lacey | date=January 2, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chains include [[Gourmet Burger Kitchen]], Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a ''dirty burger'' or ''third-wave burger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://lostincatering.com/lostincatering/london_dining_trends.html |chapter=Third Wave Burgers |title=London Menu Trends 2012 |publisher=LostinCatering }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years [[Rustlers (convenience food)|Rustlers]] has sold pre-cooked hamburgers reheatable in a [[microwave oven]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rustler's Microwave Quarterpounder 190g| url=http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1272223297835| work=sainsburys.co.uk| accessdate=April 25, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001134541/http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1272223297835| archive-date=October 1, 2011| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term &quot;burger&quot; can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Hamburger in New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|This hamburger in a fast food restaurant in [[Auckland]], New Zealand contains [[beetroot]] for flavor.]]
Fast food franchises sell American-style fast food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional [[Australasia]]n hamburgers are usually bought from [[fish and chip shop]]s or milk bars, rather than from chain restaurants. These traditional hamburgers are becoming less common as older-style fast food outlets decrease in number. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or &quot;mince&quot; as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They commonly include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion and meat as minimum—in this form, known in Australia as a &quot;plain hamburger&quot;, which often also includes a slice of beetroot—and, optionally, can  include cheese, [[beetroot]], pineapple, a fried egg and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included, it is known in Australia as &quot;burger with the lot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term 'burger' is also applied to any hot sandwich using a bun for the bread, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. The term 'sandwich' is usually only applied when the bread used is sliced bread. 

The only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to &quot;The Lot&quot; often contains a steak (beef) as well. The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and [[Tomato sauce#Australia|tomato sauce]]. The traditional Australasian hamburger never includes mayonnaise. The [[McDonald's]] &quot;McOz&quot; Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a [[Kiwiburger]], similar to a Quarter Pounder, but features salad, beetroot and a fried egg. The [[Hungry Jack's]] ([[Burger King]]) &quot;Aussie Burger&quot; has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup and a meat patty, while adding pineapple is an upcharge. It is essentially a &quot;Burger with the lot&quot;, but uses the standard HJ circular breakfast Egg, rather than the fully fried egg used by local fish shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungryjacks.com.au/menu |title=Hungry Jack's menu |accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, due to the branding of their sandwiches by [[McDonald's]] and [[KFC]] restaurants in China, the word &quot;burger&quot; (汉堡) refers to all sandwiches that are consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between. This has led to confusions when Chinese nationals try to order sandwiches with meat fillings other than beef in fast-food restaurants in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/161318777_224814|title=汉堡和三明治有什么区别？强力科普这些外来词!|date=August 1, 2017|website=Sohu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:MOS Kaisen01.JPG|thumb|right|[[MOS Burger]] [[rice burger]]]]
In [[Japan]], hamburgers can be served in a bun, called ''hanbāgā'' (ハンバーガー), or just the patties served without a bun, known as ''hanbāgu'' (ハンバーグ) or &quot;hamburg&quot;, short for &quot;hamburg steak&quot;.

''[[Hamburg steak]]s'' (served without buns) are similar to what are known as [[Salisbury steak]]s in the U.S. They are made from minced beef, pork or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, egg, breadcrumbs and spices. They are served with [[brown sauce]] (or [[demi-glace]] in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in [[Japanese curry|Japanese curries]]. Hamburgers may be served in casual, western style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as &quot;[[casual dining|family restaurants]]&quot;.

Hamburgers in buns, on the other hand, are predominantly the domain of fast food chains. Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as [[MOS Burger]], [[First Kitchen]] and [[Freshness Burger]]. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include [[teriyaki]] burgers, ''katsu'' burgers (containing [[tonkatsu]]) and burgers containing shrimp [[korokke]]. Some of the more unusual examples include the [[rice burger]], where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1000-yen (US$10) &quot;Takumi Burger&quot; (meaning &quot;artisan taste&quot;), featuring [[avocado]]s, freshly grated [[wasabi]], and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with [[Kobe beef]], butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently launched a McPork burger, made with U.S. [[pork]]. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains, due in part to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, &quot;upscale&quot; hamburger offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ideaforesight: Upscale, modern fast food | url=http://ideaforesight.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/upscale-modern-fast-food/|work=ideaforesight's blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burger King]] once retreated from Japan, but re-entered the market in Summer 2007 in cooperation with the Korean owned Japanese fast-food chain Lotteria.

According to the Guinness World Records, a Japanese man, [[Takeru Kobayashi]] ate the greatest number of hamburgers in three minutes on July 11, 2014.[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-hamburgers-eaten-in-three-minutes Most medium hamburgers eaten in three minutes]

Rice burgers, mentioned above, are also available in several East Asian countries such as [[Taiwan]] and [[South Korea]]. [[Lotteria]] is a big hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they also have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include [[Bulgogi]] burgers and [[Kimchi]] burgers.

[[File:Jumbo Vada Pav (dodged).jpg|thumb|left|[[Vada pav]] or &quot;Indian Burger&quot; is made of potatoes and spices.]]
In [[India]], burgers are usually made from chicken or vegetable patties due to cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious practice) and pork (which stems from [[Islamic]] religious practice). Because of this, the majority of fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India, for instance, does not serve beef, offering the &quot;Maharaja Mac&quot; instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken. Another version of the Indian vegetarian burger is the [[Wada Pav]] consisting deep-fried potato patty dipped in gramflour batter. It is usually served with mint chutney and fried green chili. Another alternative is the &quot;Buff Burger&quot; made with buffalo meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lbb.in/pune/best-burgers-pune/|title=Bite Into 11 Of The Best Burgers In Pune &amp;#124; LBB|website=LBB, Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mongolia]], a recent fast food craze due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to the prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.

In [[Turkey]], in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. &quot;Wet-Burger&quot;), which a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb-burgers and [[offal]]-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and [[Burger King]]. Most burger shops have also adopted a pizzeria-like approach when it comes to home delivery, and almost all major fast food chains deliver.

In the [[former Yugoslavia]], and originally in [[Serbia]], there is a local version of the hamburger known as the ''[[pljeskavica]]''. It is often served as a patty, but may have a bun as well.

Throughout [[Belgium]] and in some eateries in the [[Netherlands]], a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat.&lt;ref name=Steves2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Rick Steves Belgium: Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp &amp; Ghent|date=2015|publisher=Avalon Travel|isbn=978-1631210655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew F.|title=Hamburger a global history|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781861893901|url-access=registration|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1861896315|chapter=The Global Burger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds.

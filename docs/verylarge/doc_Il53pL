Albuquerque is located at the crossroads of several ecoregions. According to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|title=Ecoregion Download Files by State - Region 6|first=ORD|last=US EPA|date=March 9, 2016|website=US EPA|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215174613/https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|archive-date=December 15, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city is located in the southeastern edge of the [[Arizona/New Mexico Plateau]], with the [[Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion]] defining the adjacent Sandia-Manzano mountains, including the foothills in the eastern edges of the city proper east of Juan Tabo or Tramway boulevards. Though the city lies to the north of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], parts of Albuquerque shares a similar aridity, temperature regime, and natural vegetation to that of the Chihuahuan Desert, namely the upper elevations with desert grassland and sand scrub plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|title=NMSU: New Mexico Range Plants|website=aces.nmsu.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503163417/https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|archive-date=May 3, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern areas of the Greater Albuquerque Area, known as the East Mountain Area, lie the [[Southwestern Tablelands]] and are sometimes considered a southern extension of the central high plains and northeast New Mexico highlands. To the north is the [[Southern Rockies]] ecoregion in the Jemez Mountains.

The average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation providing an arid climate, and no month's daily temperature averages below freezing. Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|°F}} and {{convert|36.4|°F}} respectively.

Albuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;noaasun&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&amp;nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun, mostly during the cooler months. Extended cloudiness lasting longer than two or three days is rare.

Winter typically consists of cool days and cold nights, except following passage of the strongest cold fronts and arctic airmasses when daytime temperatures remain colder than average; overnight temperatures tend to fall below freezing between about 10 pm and 8 am in the city, except during colder airmasses, plus colder spots of the valley and most of the East Mountain areas. December, the coolest month, averages {{convert|36.3|°F|1}}, although extreme low temperatures bottom out in early January; the median or normal coolest temperature of the year is just above {{convert|10|°F|0}}, though the average or mean is below {{convert|10|°F|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215165129/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg |archive-date=December 15, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wrcc.dri.edu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|title=ALBUQUERQUE INTL AP, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527143551/http://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm0234|archive-date=May 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical for daily low temperatures in much of December, January, and February to be below freezing, the long-term average 76 of 90 days falling to or below freezing; four 24 hour days stay below freezing on average, though that often occurs for less hours west of the Rio Grande and in the Heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrcc.dri.edu&quot;/&gt;

Spring is windy, sometimes unsettled with rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. March and April tend to experience many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust. In May, the winds tend to subside as a summer-like airmass and temperatures begin to occur with regularity.

Summer is lengthy and very warm to hot, relatively tolerable for most people because of low humidity and air movement. The exception is some days during the [[North American Monsoon]], when daily humidity remains relatively high, especially in July and August. 2.7 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}} or warmer highs occur annually on average, mostly in June and July and rarely in August due in part to the monsoon; an average of 60 days experience {{convert|90|°F|0}} or warmer highs. 28 days with highs at or above {{convert|100|°F|0}} occurred in the summer of 1980 at Albuquerque's Sunport,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeatures_100degrees|title=100° Facts for Albuquerque and New Mexico|first=NOAA|last=US Department of Commerce|website=www.weather.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231250/https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeatures_100degrees|archive-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; though such temperatures are a rare occurrence. Portions of the valley and West Mesa locations experience more high temperatures above {{convert|90|°F|0}} and {{convert|100|°F|0}} as part of normal or extreme weather each summer.

Fall is generally cool in the mornings and nights but sees less rain than summer, though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter, as colder airmasses and weather patterns build in from the north and northwest with more frequency.

Precipitation averages about 9.5 inches per year using recent 30-year periods, but during the period of record beginning in 1897, the average is 8.7 inches.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrcc.dri.edu&quot;/&gt; On average, January is the driest month, while July and August are the wettest months, as a result of shower and thunderstorm activity produced by the [[North American Monsoon]] prevalent over the Southwestern United States. Most rain occurs during the late summer monsoon season, typically starting in early July and ending in mid-September.

Albuquerque averages about 10 inches of snow per winter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiences several accumulating snow events each season. Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains. The city was one of several in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on December 28–30, 2006, with locations in Albuquerque receiving between {{convert|10.5|and|26|in|cm}} of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/climate/Monthlyreports/December/2006/PNS12312006.htm|title = Preliminary total snowfall reports across central and northern New Mexico from the December 28–30 winter storm|date = December 31, 2006|accessdate = August 5, 2009|publisher = National Weather Service Albuquerque, NM|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/65USJjDXu?url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/?n=monthly-summaries|archive-date = February 16, 2012|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a major winter storm in late February 2015 dropped up to a foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow on most of the city. Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.

The mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8–9&amp;nbsp;inches (216&amp;nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6–8&amp;nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10–17&amp;nbsp;inches annually.

Traveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment. One such area is considered part of Albuquerque Metropolitan Area, commonly called the East Mountain area; it is covered in woodlands of juniper and piñon trees, a common trait of southwestern uplands and the southernmost Rocky Mountains.

Albuquerque's [[drinking water]] comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan-Chama Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Your Drinking Water| url=http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| accessdate=August 1, 2013| website=Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805163835/http://abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| archive-date=August 5, 2013| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that has been described as an &quot;underground [[Lake Superior]]&quot;. The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) has developed a water resources management strategy that pursues [[water conservation|conservation]] and the direct extraction of water from the Rio Grande for the development of a stable underground aquifer in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Odenwald |first=Arlene Cinelli |date=April 1993 |title=Protecting the aquifer: Albuquerque reacting |journal=New Mexico Business Journal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=38–39 |issn=0164-6796 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109101124/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;water strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority: Water Resource Management Strategy |website=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |date=January 10, 2007 |url=http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029020514/http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tingley Beach Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Tingley Beach in Old Town, Albuquerque, a pond in a former watercourse by the Rio Grande]]

The aquifer of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] is too [[brackish water|saline]] to be cost-effectively used for drinking. Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].

Of the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]–[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.&lt;ref&gt;The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder. One of the policies of the ABCWUA's strategy is the acquisition of additional river water.&lt;ref name=&quot;water strategy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |title=The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |publisher=Abcwua.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507020947/http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |archivedate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Rp|Policy G, 14}}

=== Religion ===
According to a study by [[Sperling's BestPlaces]], the majority of the religious population in Albuquerque are Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/city/new_mexico/albuquerque| title=Albuquerque, New Mexico Religion| website=bestplaces.net| access-date=15 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915123408/https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/city/new_mexico/albuquerque| archive-date=September 15, 2018| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a historical Spanish and Mexican city, the [[Catholic Church]] is the largest Christian church in Albuquerque. The Catholic population of Albuquerque is served by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe]], whose administrative center is located in the city. Collectively, other Christian churches and organizations such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and others make up the second largest group in the city. [[Baptists]] form the third largest Christian group, followed by the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]].

The second largest religious population in the city are [[eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The Albuquerque Sikh Gurudwara and Guru Nanak Gurdwara Albuquerque serve the city's Sikh populace; the Hindu Temple Society of New Mexico serves the Hindu population; several Buddhist temples and centers are located in the city limits.

[[Judaism]] is the second-largest non-Christian religious group in Albuquerque, followed by [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Congregation Albert]] is a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogue established in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;congregationalbert.org&quot; /&gt; It is the oldest continuing Jewish organization in the city.

Hundreds of hot-air balloons are seen every day, and there is live music, arts and crafts, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide| title=Guest Info| website=Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta| access-date=September 11, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906111828/http://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide| archive-date=September 6, 2016| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Albuquerque}}[[John Gaw Meem]], credited with developing and popularizing the [[Pueblo Revival]] style, was based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] but received an important Albuquerque commission in 1933 as the architect of the [[University of New Mexico]]. He retained this commission for the next quarter-century and developed the university's distinctive Southwest style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot; /&gt; {{Rp|317}} Meem also designed the [[Cathedral Church of St. John (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cathedral Church of St. John]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;diocese&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| title=History of the Diocese|publisher=Diocese of the Rio Grande| accessdate=January 3, 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328194349/http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| archivedate=March 28, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albuquerque boasts a unique nighttime cityscape. Many building exteriors are illuminated in vibrant colors such as green and blue. The Wells Fargo Building is illuminated green. The DoubleTree Hotel changes colors nightly, and the Compass Bank building is illuminated blue. The [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the county courthouse is illuminated yellow, while the tops of the Bank of Albuquerque and the Bank of the West are illuminated reddish-yellow. Due to the nature of the soil in the Rio Grande Valley, the skyline is lower than might be expected in a city of comparable size elsewhere.

[[File:Albuquerque Roosevelt Park.JPG|thumb|right|[[Roosevelt Park (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Roosevelt Park]] is a historic park in central Albuquerque]]Albuquerque has expanded greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;1&amp;nbsp;mile&amp;nbsp;(1.61&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; grid. Each &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;1&amp;nbsp;square mile&amp;nbsp;(2.59&amp;nbsp;km{{sup|2}})&lt;/span&gt; is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;0.5&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(0.8&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.

===Libraries===
The [[Albuquerque Bernalillo County Library|Albuquerque and Bernalillo County Library System]] consists of eighteen libraries to serve Albuquerque, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;https://abqlibrary.org/about-us/mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Main Library was the first library of Albuquerque and from 1901 until 1948 it was the only public library. The original library was donated to the state by Joshua and Sarah Raynolds. After suffering some fire damage in 1923 the city decided it was time to construct a building for the library to be moved to, however, by 1970 even after additions were made the population and library needs had outgrown the building for its use as a main library and it was turned into Special Collections. The Old Main Library was recognized as a landmark in September 1979. 
It was not until 1974 with the movement of the South Valley Library into a new building that the Bernalillo built and administered a public library. Not long after, in 1986, the Bernalillo and Albuquerque government decided that joint powers would work best to serve the needs of the community and created the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System.&lt;ref&gt;https://abqlibrary.org/libraryhistory&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks and recreation===
According to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department. The total amount of parkland is 42.9 square miles (111 km2), or about 23% of the city's total area—one of the highest percentages among large cities in the U.S. About 82% of city residents live within walking distance of a park.

Albuquerque has a botanical and zoological complex called the [[Albuquerque Biological Park]], consisting of the Rio Grande Botanic Garden, Albuquerque Aquarium, Tingley Beach, and the Rio Grande Zoo.

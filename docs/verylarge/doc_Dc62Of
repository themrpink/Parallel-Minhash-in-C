The river beyond, near the village Sonpeth, flows into [[Parbhani District|Parbhani]]. In Parbhani District, River Godavari flows through [[Gangakhed]] taluka. As mentioned above, the Godavari is also called Dakshinganga so the city is called as Gangakhed (meaning a village on the bank of Ganga). As per Hindu rituals this place is considered quite important for after death peace to flow ashes into the river.

Its course is relatively non-significant except for receiving two smaller streams – Indrayani and Masuli – merging at its left and right banks respectively. Within the last taluka of the district [[Parbhani District|Parbhani]], [[Purna]], the river drains a major tributary of the same name: [[Purna River (tributary of Godavari)|Purna]].

It then exits into the neighboring district of [[Nanded District|Nanded]] where {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} before reaching the town Nanded, it is impounded by the Vishnupuri Dam and thus with it, bringing Asia's largest lift irrigation projects to life. A little downstream from Nanded, the river receives Asna, a small stream, on its left bank. It then runs into the controversial [[Babli project]] soon ends its course within [[Maharashtra]], albeit temporarily, at its merger with a major tributary – [[Manjira River|Manjira]].

The river after flowing into Telangana, re-emerges to run as a state boundary separating the [[Mancherial district|Mancherial]], [[Telangana]] from [[Gadchiroli district|Gadchiroli]], Maharashtra. At the state border, it runs between [[Sironcha]] and Somnoor Sangam receiving one tributary at each of those nodal points – the [[Pranhita River|Pranhita]] and subsequently the [[Indravati River|Indravati]].

===Within Telangana===

Godavari enters into Telangana in Nizamabad district at Kandakurthy where Manjira, Haridra rivers joins Godavari and forms Triveni Sangamam. The river flows along the border between [[Nirmal district|Nirmal]] and [[Mancherial district]]s in the north and [[Nizamabad district|Nizamabad]], [[Jagtial district|Jagityal]], [[Peddapalli district|Peddapalli]] districts to its south. About {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} after entering [[Telangana]] it merges with the back waters of the [[Sriram Sagar Project|Sriram Sagar Dam]]. The river after emerging through the dam gates, enjoys a wide river bed, often splitting to encase sandy islands. The river receives a minor but significant tributary [[Kadam river]]. It then emerges at its eastern side to act as state border with Maharashtra only to later enter into [[Bhadradri Kothagudem district]]. In this district the river flows through an important Hindu pilgrimage town – [[Bhadrachalam]].

The river further swells after receiving a minor tributary [[Kinnerasani River]] and exits into [[Andhra Pradesh]].

Within the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], it flows through hilly terrain of the [[Eastern Ghats]] known as the [[Papi Hills|Papi hills]] which explains the narrowing of its bed as it flows through a gorge for a few km, only to re-widen at [[Polavaram]]. The deepest bed level of Godavari River, located 36 km upstream of Polavaram dam, is at 45 meters below the sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/Polavaram-project-report-NGT.pdf|title=Polavaram project studies by NGT (page 56)|accessdate=1 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before crossing the Papi hills, it receives its last major tributary [[Sabari River]] on its left bank. The river upon reaching the plains begins to widen out until it reaches [[Rajamahendravaram]] City. [[Arma Konda]] ({{convert|1680|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is the highest peak in the Godavari river basin as well as in Eastern Ghats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pletcher2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Kenneth Pletcher | title=The Geography of India: Sacred and Historic Places | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjr0X-8jrLAC&amp;pg=PA28| date=2010 | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn=978-16-1530-142-3 | pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage]] was constructed across [[River Godavari]] in [[Rajamahendravaram]] City. At [[Rajamahendravaram]], the Godavari splits into two branches which are called Vriddha Gautami (Gautami Godavari) and Vasishta Godavari.  Again the Gautami branch splits into two branches namely Gautami and Nilarevu. Similarly, the Vasishta splits into two branches named Vasishta and Vainateya. These four branches which join the [[Bay of Bengal]] at different places, are forming a delta of length {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is called the [[Konaseema]] region. This delta along with the delta of the [[Krishna River]] is called the ''Rice Granary'' of [[South India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2554303/ Kakani Nageswara Rao, et al.; ''Holocene environmental changes of the Godavari Delta, east coast of India, inferred from sediment core analyses and AMS 14C dating'', Geomorphology, 175–176 (2012) pp.163–175]

==Tributaries==
The major [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the river can be classified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwc.nic.in/main/webpages/hba.pdf |last=Central Water Commission |title=Integrated Hydrological Data Book (Non-classified river basins) |year=2012 |accessdate=15 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192920/http://www.cwc.nic.in/main/webpages/hba.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the left bank tributaries which include the [[Purna River (tributary of Godavari)|Purna]], [[Pranhita]], [[Indravati]] and [[Sabari River]] covering nearly 59.7% of the total catchment area of the basin and the right bank tributaries [[Pravara River|Pravara]], [[Manjira River|Manjira]], [[Manair River|Manair]] together contributing 16.1% of the basin.

[[Pranhita]] is the largest tributary covering about 34% of its drainage basin. Though the river proper flows only for {{convert|113|km|mi|abbr=on}}, by virtue of its extensive tributaries [[Wardha River|Wardha]], [[Wainganga]], [[Painganga River|Penganga]], the sub-basin drains all of [[Vidharba]] region as well as the southern slopes of the [[Satpura Range]]s. [[Indravati]] is the 2nd largest tributary, known as the &quot;lifeline&quot; of the [[Kalahandi]], [[Nabarangapur]] of [[Odisha]] &amp; [[Bastar district]] of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Due to their enormous sub-basins both [[Indravati]] and [[Pranhita]] are considered rivers in their own right. [[Manjira]] is the longest tributary and holds the [[Nizam Sagar]] reservoir. [[Purna River (tributary of Godavari)|Purna]] is a prime river in the water scarce [[Marathwada]] region of [[Maharashtra]].

Other than these 7 principal ones, it has many smaller but significant ones draining into it. Indravati river flood waters overflows in to the Jouranala which is part of Sabari basin. A barrage at {{Coord|19|7|19|N|82|14|9|E|name=Jouranala barrage}} is constructed across the Indravati river to divert Indravati water in to Sabari river for enhanced hydro power generation.

The river is sacred to [[Hindus]] and has several places on its banks, that have been places of pilgrimage for thousands of years. Amongst the huge numbers of people who have bathed in her waters as a rite of cleansing are said to have been the deity [[Balarama|Baladeva]] 5000 years ago and the saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] 500 years ago. Every twelve years, [[Godavari Maha Pushkaram|Pushkaram]] fair is held on the banks of the river.

[[File:Sculpture depicting govu vatsa and gowthama legend.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting govu vatsa and gowthama legend about birth of Godavari River]]
A legend has it that the sage Gautama lived in the Brahmagiri Hills at [[Tryambakeshwar]] with his wife Ahalya. The couple lived the rest of their lives in the then village called ''Govuru'', now known as [[Kovvur]] (&quot;cow&quot;) since the British rule. Ahalya lived in a nearby place called ''Thagami'' (now [[Thogummi]]). The sage, as a reason for the practice of ''annadanam'' (&quot;giving away food&quot; to the needy), started cultivating rice crops and other crops. Once, the god [[Ganesha]], on the wish of the [[Rishi Muni|munis]], sent a miraculous cow ''maaya-dhenu'', which resembled a normal cow. It entered the sage's abode and started spoiling the rice while he was meditating. Since cattle is sacred to Hindus and shall always be treated with respect, he put the ''dharbha'' grass on the cow. But, to his surprise, it fell dead. Seeing what happened before their eyes, the munis and their wives cried out, &quot;We thought that Gautama-maharishi is a righteous man, but he committed bovicide (killing of a cow or cattle)!&quot;. The sage wished to atone for this grievous sin. Therefore, he went to [[Nashik]] and observed [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] to Lord Tryambakeshwara (a manifestation of the god [[Shiva]]), on the advice of the munis, praying for atonement and asking Him to make the [[Ganges]] flow over the cow. Shiva was pleased with the sage and diverted the Ganges which washed away the cow and gave rise to the Godavari river in Nashik. The water stream flowed past Kovvur and ultimately merged with the Bay of Bengal.

[[File:Godavari Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Bridge]] on the left and [[Godavari Arch Bridge]] on the right]]

There are 4 bridges spanning the river between [[East Godavari]] and [[West Godavari]] districts.
# [[Old Godavari Bridge]] (also known as Havelock bridge, and named after then Madras governor)
# [[Godavari Bridge]] (also known as Rail-cum-road bridge and Kovvur-Rajahmundry Bridge)
# [[Godavari Arch Bridge]] (also known as New railway bridge)
# Fourth Bridge (also known as new road bridge)

* Old Godavari Bridge
Construction of this bridge started in 1876, and was completed in 1897. It was constructed under the supervision of F.T. Granville Walton who had constructed the Dufferin Bridge over the Ganges, and Granville Mills, both British engineers. Spanning over 3&amp;nbsp;km in length, it linked the East Godavari and West Godavari districts. The bridge has been a vital link enabling trains to run between [[Chennai]] and [[Howrah]]. Trains continued over the bridge for a century until 1997, when train services over the bridge were suspended after the construction of two additional bridges.

* Godavari Bridge
Construction of this bridge started in 1970, and was completed in 1974. It serves as both a railway and a roadway between the East Godavari and West Godavari Districts.

* Godavari Arch Bridge
This bridge was completed in 1997, was built upstream of the earlier bridges.

* Fourth Bridge
This bridge is the newest. It was opened to public from Godavari Pushkaras 2015. This is a road connectivity bridge link supposed to ease traffic flow between Rajamundry and Kovvur

The main Godavari River up to the confluence with Pranhita tributary is dammed fully to utilize the available water for irrigation.  However, its main tributaries Pranhita, Indravati and Sabari which join in the lower reaches of the basin, carry three times more water compared to main Godavari. In 2015, the water surplus Godavari River is linked to the water deficit [[Krishna River]] by commissioning the [[Polavaram Project|Polavaram right bank canal]] with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme to augment water availability to the [[Prakasam Barrage]] located in Andhra Pradesh.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} upstream from [[Nashik]] city. The reservoir known as the Gangapur Bandh Sagar provides drinking water to the Nashik city and also supplies water to the thermal power station situated downstream at [[Eklahare]].
* [[Jayakwadi dam]]: Located near [[Paithan]], it is one of the largest earthen dams in India. This dam was built to address the dual problems of flooding along the banks, during monsoon months, and that of drought, rest of the year, in the [[Marathwada]] region. Two 'left' and 'right' canals provide the irrigation to fertile land up to [[Nanded district]]. This dam has contributed to industrial development of [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Jalna District|Jalna]], [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name = &quot;JDR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/vijdiw-474335-jaikwadi-dam-and-its-nath-sagar-reservoir/ | last=vijdiw |title=Jaikwadi Dam and Its Nath Sagar Reservoir | publisher= authorstream.com | accessdate=15 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Majalgaon Dam]] is also constructed under Jayakwadi stage 2 to expand the irrigation potential further in [[Parbhani district|Parbhani]], [[Nanded district|Nanded]] and [[Beed district]]s.

* [[Ghatghar Dam]] was built for hydro power generation by diverting the water of Pravara tributary outside Godavari river basin to a west flowing river which joins Arabian sea.
* [[Upper Vaitarana Dam|Upper Vaitarna reservoir]] was built across west flowing [[Vaitarna]] river merging some part of Godavari river catchment area. Godavari water impounded in this reservoir is diverted outside the river basin for [[Mumbai]] city drinking water supply after generating hydro power.
* [[Sriram Sagar Project|Sriram Sagar Dam]]: This is another multipurpose project on the Godavari River on the borders of Adilabad and Nizamabad District. It is near the town of Pochampad, 60&amp;nbsp;km away from Nizamabad. It has been described by [[The Hindu]] as a &quot;lifeline for a large part of [[Telangana]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/05/16/stories/2005051611230300.htm Maharashtra projects hit Sriram Sagar project inflows: BJP].

==Geology and sediment transfer in the Godavari Drainage Basin==
[[File:Generalized Geological Map of Godavari Drainage Basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Generalized Geological Map of Godavari Drainage Basin]]

The primary/initial catchment of the Godavari drainage basin is largely represented by the basalt of the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan Volcanic Province]] (~50% of the total basin area). This is followed by the [[Precambrian]] [[granite]]s and [[gneiss]]es of the eastern [[Dharwar Craton]], [[sandstone]]s, [[shale]]s and [[limestone]]s of the [[Gondwana]] Supergroup, various sedimentary units of Cuddapah and Vindhyan basins, [[charnockite]]s and [[khondalite]]s of the [[Proterozoic]] [[Eastern Ghats]] Mobile Belt and the sandstones of the Rajahmundry Formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulkarni 376–384&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Y.

The bed loads on the other hand are of sourced from local bedrock. Influx of Deccan source in the Godavari River up to the delta regions and possibly in the [[Bay of Bengal]] off the Godavari, therefore, can be related to the intensive [[chemical weathering]] in the Deccan basalts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulkarni 376–384&quot;/&gt; Abrupt increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values and decrease in TOC content accompanied with a significant increase in ferrimagnetic mineral concentration in Bay of Bengal sediments from ~3.2 to 3.1 cal. ka BP reflected a shift of organic carbon and sediment source and a severe decline in vegetation coverage. Such phenomena indicate intensified deforestation and soil/rock erosion in the Deccan Plateau producing higher ferrimagnetic mineral inputs, which is in agreement with significant expansion of agricultural activities in the Deccan Chalcolithic cultural period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Meng|last2=Wang|first2=Zhanghua|last3=Nageswara Rao|first3=Kakani|last4=Sangode|first4=S J|last5=Saito|first5=Yoshiki|last6=Chen|first6=Ting|last7=Kulkarni|first7=Y R|last8=Naga Kumar|first8=K Ch V|last9=Demudu|first9=G|date=2017-06-29|title=A mid- to late-Holocene record of vegetation decline and erosion triggered by monsoon weakening and human adaptations in the south-east Indian Peninsula|journal=The Holocene|volume=27|issue=12|language=en|pages=1976–1987|doi=10.1177/0959683617715694|issn=0959-6836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mineral deposits==
{{See also |List of mines in India}}
The Godavari River basin is endowed with rich mineral deposits such as oil and gas, coal, iron, [[limestone]], manganese, copper, [[bauxite]], granite, [[laterite]], and others. The following are the few noted deposits:
{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}

==Ecological concerns==
[[File:The Godavari river at Puntamba in January.JPG|right|thumb|Dried up Godavari exposing [[flood basalt]] river bed as seen from the back of Changdev temple in [[Puntamba]]]]

The frequent drying up of the Godavari river in the drier months has been a matter of great concern. Indiscriminate damming along the river has been cited as an obvious reason. Within Maharashtra sugarcane irrigation has been blamed as one of the foremost causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-krishna-godavari-basins-drying-up-1812489 |last=Pawar |first=Yogesh |title=Krishna, Godavari basins drying up |date=18 March 2013|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the river was at its all-time low in the [[Nizamabad district]] of Telangana. This had hit the growth of fish, making the life of fishermen miserable. The water-level was so low that people could easily walk into the middle of the river. Shortage in rainfall and closure of the controversial [[Babli project]] gates in Maharashtra was thought to have affected the water flow in the river and water availability to the [[Sriram Sagar Project]] except during above 20% excess monsoon (i.e. one out of four years) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irrisoft.org/cms/fileadmin/content/zfb/1998_02/keller_keller_davids_1998_river_basin_development_phases_implications_closure.pdf |title=River basin development phases and implications of closure |author=J.

A study has found that the delta is at a greater risk as the rate of sediment [[aggradation]] (raising the level of the delta through sediment deposition) no longer exceeds relative [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/sinking-indian-deltas-put-millions-at-risk/article23086.ece |last=R Prasad |title=Sinking Indian deltas put millions at risk |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=15 January 2016|date=2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It further states that the suspended sediment load at the delta has reduced from 150·2 million tons during 1970–1979 to 57·2 million tons by 2000–2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/an-introduction-to-godavari-basin |last=South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People |title=Godavari's Story |year=2014 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates into a three-fold decline in the past 4 decades. Impacts of this can be seen in destroyed villages like [[Uppada]] in Godavari delta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/nov102004/1232.pdf |author1=B Hema Malini |author2=K Nageswara Raol |title=Coastal erosion and habitat loss along the Godavari delta front – a fallout of dam construction (?) |journal=Current Science |volume=87 |number=9 |date=10 November 2004 |page=1232 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; destruction of Mangrove forests and fragmentation of shoreline – possibly a fallout of dam construction.

Said to further epitomise the insensitivity towards Godavari, is the [[Polavaram Project]] which is touted to be gigantic – both in terms of size and violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/polavaram-fraud--33444 |last=Mahapatra |first=Richard |title=Polavaram fraud |year=2011 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deemed as being pointless and politically driven,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/polavaram-dam-works-to-begin-on-oct-22/article7387796.ece |last=Times of India |title=Polavaram dam works to begin on Oct. 22 |date=5 July 2015 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project raises questions about environmental clearance, displacement of upstream human habitations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/telangana-bandh-over-modi-govts-ordinance-on-polavaram/20140529.htm |last=Rediff News |title=Telangana bandh over Modi govt's ordinance on Polavaram|date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; loss of forest cover, technicalities in the dam design which are said to play down flood threats and unsafe embankments.

[[Residual sodium carbonate index|High alkalinity water]] is discharged from the ash dump areas of many coal fired power stations into the river which further increases the [[alkalinity]] of the river water whose water is naturally of high alkalinity since the river basin is draining vast area of [[Basalt#Weathering|basalt]] formations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/bitstream/10054/1531/1/5806.pdf Chemical weathering in the Krishna Basin and Western Ghats of the Deccan Traps, India]&lt;/ref&gt; This problem aggravates during the lean flow months in entire river basin. Already the Godavari basin area in Telangana is suffering from high alkalinity and salinity water problem which is converting soils in to unproductive [[alkali soil|sodic alkali soils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Alkalinity-and-salinity-bane-of-soil-in-T-state/articleshow/48383411.cms|title=  Alkalinity and salinity bane of soil in T state|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the few coal fired power stations located in the river basin:

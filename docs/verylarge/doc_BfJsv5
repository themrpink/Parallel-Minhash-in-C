TPS (later renamed to &quot;Interleaf 5,&quot; up through &quot;Interleaf 7&quot;) was an integrated, networked text-and-graphics document creation system initially designed for technical publishing departments. Versions after its first release in 1984 added instantaneous updating of page numbering and reference numbers through multi-chapter and multi-volumes sets, increased graphics capabilities, automatic index and table of content generation, hyphenation, equations, &quot;microdocuments&quot; that recursively allowed fully functional whole document elements to be embedded in any document, and the ability to program any element of a document (a capability the company called &quot;Active Documents&quot;). Interleaf software was available in many languages including Japanese text layout.

TPS was a structured document editor. That is, it internally treated a document as a set of element classes, each with its own set of properties. Classes might include common document elements such as a body, paragraphs, titles, subheadings, captions, etc. Authors were free to create any set of elements and save them as a reusable template. The properties of a class &amp;mdash; its font size, for example &amp;mdash; could be changed and automatically applied to every instance of that class. If this caused a change in pagination &amp;mdash; increasing the font size could change where the page breaks were &amp;mdash; the software would update the screen quickly enough for the author to continue typing, including altering all of the cross-references that the author may have inserted; this WYSIWYG capability was a competitive advantage for the company. The structured nature of the documents also enabled TPS to provide ''conditional document assembly'', a feature that enabled users to &quot;tag&quot; document elements with [[metadata]] about them, and then automatically assemble versions of the document based upon those tags. For example, an aircraft manufacturer might tag paragraphs with the model number of the planes to which they applied and then assemble versions of the documentation specific to each model.

The fact that it created structured documents enabled Interleaf to add its Active Document capabilities in the early 1990s. Just as [[JavaScript]] enables contemporary software developers to add functionality and &quot;intelligence&quot; to Web documents, Interleaf used LISP to enable document authors and engineers to enhance its authoring electronic publishing systems. Any document element could be given new &quot;[[Method (computer programming)|methods]]&quot; (capabilities), and could respond to changes in the content or structure of the document itself. Typical applications included documents that automatically generated and updated charts based upon data expressed in the document, pages that altered themselves based on data accessed from databases or other sources, and systems that dynamically created pages to guide users through complex processes such as filling out insurance forms.

=== Interleaf Relational Document Manager (RDM) ===

RDM was an early [[document management]] product, acquired in the late 1980s and then integrated with Interleaf's other products. RDM used a [[relational database management system]] to manage the elements of complex document sets, including their versions. Team of authors and editors would &quot;check in&quot; their documents when done with a work session, and begin a new session by &quot;checking them out.&quot; In so doing, RDM would ensure that the authors were working on the most current version of the document, even if another author had worked on it in the interim.

=== Interleaf WorldView ===

Interleaf Worldview's core functionality is familiar to users of [[Adobe Acrobat]] and other [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) viewers, although Worldview preceded it by a year&lt;ref&gt;Worldview was launched in 1992. {{Citation

}}. The [[Adobe Acrobat version history| first version of Adobe Acrobat]] was released on June 15, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Worldview allowed document sets created with Interleaf's technical publishing tools to be viewed on workstations, Macintoshes, and PCs, retaining page fidelity, and including hyperlinks among the pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Borzo|first1=Jeanette|title=Interleaf Document Viewer to Span Different Platforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=interleaf+worldview+1992&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=13 November 2015|magazine=InfoWorld|date=3 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interleaf WorldView Press ===

Worldview Press prepared documents for online viewing via Worldview. It imported documents created not only with Interleaf's systems but by the other major document creation and graphic systems of the time, including [[Microsoft Word]], [[PostScript]], [[TIFF]] and [[SGML]]. Using Interleaf's technical publishing system's ability to reformat documents rapidly, Worldview Press enabled the creation of documents formatted for particular delivery vehicles. For example, the same documents could be formatted for reading on a small laptop screen or for a large workstation's monitor.  WorldView Press, developed in Lisp, was conceived and implemented by Jim Giza.

=== Interleaf Cyberleaf===

As the [[World Wide Web]] became increasingly adopted as the preferred mechanism for distributing electronic documents, Interleaf added Cyberleaf, a  version of the WorldView Press that  produced HTML documents.

== Competitors ==

In the technical authoring and publishing area, [[Framemaker]] and [[Ventura Publisher]] became major competitors.

In the document management area, Interleaf competed with [[Documentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''''One Thousand and One Nights''''' ({{lang-ar|أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌ}}, ''{{transl|ar|ʾAlf Laylah wa-Laylah}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=3rd|editor=Kate Fleet |editor2=Gudrun Krämer |editor3=Denis Matringe |editor4=John Nawas |editor5=Everett Rowson|year=2007|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of [[Middle East]]ern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. It is often known in English as the '''''Arabian Nights''''', from the first English-language edition (c. 1706–1721), which rendered the title as ''The Arabian Nights' Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;See illustration of title page of Grub St Edition in Yamanaka and Nishio (p. 225)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central and South Asia, and North Africa. Some tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Sanskrit literature|Indian]], [[Greek literature|Greek]], [[Jewish literature|Jewish]] and [[Turkish literature|Turkish]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Marzolph2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Marzolph|title=The Arabian Nights in Transnational Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tknULXNl21oC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2007|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-3287-0|pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt; folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk eras]], while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the [[Middle Persian literature#&quot;Pahlavi&quot; literature|Pahlavi Persian work]] ''Hezār Afsān'' ({{lang-fa|هزار افسان}}, lit. ''A Thousand Tales''), which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

What is common to all the editions of the ''Nights'' is the initial [[frame story]] of the ruler [[Shahryār]] and his wife [[Scheherazade]] and the [[framing device]] incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others are self-contained. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in [[prose]], although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single [[couplet]]s or [[quatrain]]s, although some are longer.

Some of the stories commonly associated with the ''Arabian Nights''—particularly &quot;[[Aladdin|Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp]]&quot; and &quot;[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]&quot;—were not part of the collection in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by [[Antoine Galland]] after he heard them from the [[Maronites|Maronite Christian]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab|Hanna Diab]] on Diab's visit to [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;John Payne, ''Alaeddin and the Enchanted Lamp and Other Stories'', (London 1901) gives details of Galland's encounter with 'Hanna' in 1709 and of the discovery in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris of two Arabic manuscripts containing Aladdin and two more of the added tales. [http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/index.htm Text of &quot;Alaeddin and the enchanted lamp&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories, such as &quot;[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]&quot;, had an independent existence before being added to the collection.

The main [[frame story]] concerns Shahryār  ({{lang-fa|شهريار}}, from [[Middle Persian]]: ''šahr-dār'', 'holder of realm'),&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ch. Pellat|title=Alf Layla Wa Layla|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla|year=2011|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom the narrator calls a &quot;[[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king&quot; ruling in &quot;India and China.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Arabian Nights'', translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons (Penguin Classics, 2008), vol. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Shahryār is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him. Eventually the [[vizier]], whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. [[Scheherazade]] ({{lang-fa|شهْرزاد|links=no}}, ''Shahrazād'', from Middle Persian: {{lang-fa|شهر|label=none}}, ''čehr'', 'lineage' + {{lang-fa|ازاد|label=none}}, ''āzād'', 'noble'),&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Hamori, A.|title=S̲h̲ahrazād|year=2012|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=2nd|publisher=Brill|editor=P. Bearman|editor2=Th. Bianquis|editor3=C.E. Bosworth|editor4=E. van Donzel|editor5=W.P. Heinrichs|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6771}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.

The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesques]], and various forms of [[erotica]]. Numerous stories depict [[jinn]], [[ghoul]]s, [[ape]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-3sindbad.htm The Third Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman – The Arabian Nights – The Thousand and One Nights – Sir Richard Burton translator]. Classiclit.about.com (2013-07-19). Retrieved on 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sorcerer (fantasy)|sorcerers]], [[magician (fantasy)|magicians]], and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common [[protagonist]]s include the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]], in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.

Different versions differ, at least in detail, as to final endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.

The narrator's standards for what constitutes a [[cliffhanger]] seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing their life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of [[Islamic philosophy]], and in one case during a detailed description of [[Medicine in medieval Islam#Human anatomy and physiology|human anatomy]] according to [[Galen]]—and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.

==History: versions and translations==
The history of the ''Nights'' is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] summarises their findings:

{{quote|In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the ''Nights'' by [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from [[India]] and [[Persia]]. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title ''Alf Layla'', or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among them some tales about the [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Possible Indian influence===
Devices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds p.271&quot;&gt;Reynolds p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Indian folklore is represented in the ''Nights'' by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit fables]]. The influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' is particularly notable.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard F. (2002). ''Vikram and the Vampire Or Tales of Hindu Devilry'' p. xi. Adamant Media Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jataka tales|The Jataka Tales]]'' are a collection of 547 [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist stories]], which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. ''The Tale of the Bull and the Ass'' and the linked ''Tale of the Merchant and his Wife'' are found in the frame stories of both the ''Jataka'' and the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the ''Tantropakhyana''. Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of this work survive, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil,&lt;ref&gt;Artola. ''Pancatantra'' Manuscripts from South India in the ''Adyar Library Bulletin''. 1957. pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Lao,&lt;ref&gt;K. Raksamani.

Paris. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Old Javanese]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Hooykaas. Bibliotheca Javaneca No. 2. Bandoeng. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The frame story is particularly interesting, as it follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the ''Panchatantra''—with its original Indian setting.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Warder. ''Indian Kāvya Literature: The art of storytelling, Volume VI''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers. 1992. pp. 61–62, 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Panchatantra'' and various tales from ''Jatakas'' were first translated into Persian by [[Borzūya]] in 570 CE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=106622 IIS.ac.uk Dr Fahmida Suleman, &quot;Kalila wa Dimna&quot;], in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization, An Encyclopaedia'', Vol. II, pp. 432–33, ed. Josef W. Meri, New York-London: Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; they were later translated into Arabic by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa'|Ibn al-Muqaffa]] in 750 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fables of Kalila and Dimnah'', translated from the Arabic by Saleh Sa'adeh Jallad, 2002. Melisende, London, {{ISBN|1-901764-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Kalilah and Dimnah; or, The fables of Bidpai; being an account of their literary history, [https://archive.org/stream/kalilahdimnahorf00bdpkuoft#page/n19/mode/2up p. xiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian prototype: ''Hezār Afsān''===
[[File:Kelileh va Demneh.jpg|thumb|right|A page from Kelileh va Demneh dated 1429, from Herat, a Persian version of the Panchatantra – depicts the manipulative jackal-vizier, Dimna, trying to lead his lion-king into war.]]
The earliest mentions of the ''Nights'' refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, ''Hezār Afsān'' (aka ''Afsaneh'' or ''Afsana''), meaning 'The Thousand Stories'. In the 10th century [[Ibn al-Nadim]] compiled a catalogue of books (the &quot;Fihrist&quot;) in Baghdad. He noted that the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] kings of Iran enjoyed &quot;evening tales and fables&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian ''Hezār Afsān'', explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night; eventually one has the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king will delay her execution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection's literary quality, observing that &quot;it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwin pp. 49–50&quot;&gt;Irwin pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century [[Al-Masudi]] also refers to the ''Hezār Afsān'', saying the Arabic translation is called ''Alf Khurafa'' ('A Thousand Entertaining Tales') but is generally known as ''Alf Layla'' ('A Thousand Nights'). He mentions the characters Shirāzd (Scheherazade) and Dināzād.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwin p.49&quot;&gt;Irwin p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

No physical evidence of the ''Hezār Afsān'' has survived,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds p.271&quot;/&gt; so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51: &quot;It seems probable from all the above [...] that the Persian ''Hezār Afsaneh'' was translated into Arabic in the eighth or early 9th century and was given the title ''Alf Khurafa'' before being subsequently retitled ''Alf Layla''. However, it remains far from clear what the connection is between this fragment of the early text and the ''Nights'' stories as they have survived in later and fuller manuscripts; nor how the Syrian manuscripts related to later Egyptian versions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Sallis ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 2 and note 6&lt;/ref&gt; These stories include the cycle of &quot;King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas&quot; and &quot;The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son&quot; (derived from the 7th-century Persian ''Bakhtiyārnāma'').&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] scholar [[Safa Khulusi]] suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] was responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, ''Studies in Comparative Literature and Western Literary Schools,'' Chapter: ''Qisas Alf Laylah wa Laylah'' (''One thousand and one Nights''), pp. 15–85. Al-Rabita Press, Baghdad, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, The Influence of Ibn al-Muqaffa' on The Arabian Nights. ''Islamic Review'', Dec 1960, pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolving Arabic versions===
[[File:Princess Parizade Bringing Home the Singing Tree.jpg|thumb|The story of ''Princess Parizade'' and the ''Magic Tree'' by [[Maxfield Parrish]], 1906&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=princess+parizade#v=onepage&amp;q=princess%20parizade&amp;f=false The Thousand and One Nights; Or, The Arabian Night's Entertainments – David Claypoole Johnston – Google Books]. Books.google.com.pk. Retrieved on 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the mid-20th century, the scholar [[Nabia Abbott]] found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title ''The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights'', dating from the 9th century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' appears in Cairo in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irwin p.50&quot;&gt;Irwin p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:

{{quote|Some of the earlier Persian tales may have survived within the Arabic tradition altered such that Arabic Muslim names and new locations were substituted for pre-Islamic Persian ones, but it is also clear that whole cycles of Arabic tales were eventually added to the collection and apparently replaced most of the Persian materials. One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century Baghdad, including the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (died 809), his vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]] (d. 803) and the licentious poet [[Abu Nuwas]] (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds p.270&quot;&gt;Reynolds p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition is primarily represented by the earliest extensive manuscript of the ''Nights'', a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript now known as the [[Galland Manuscript]]. It and surviving copies of it are much shorter and include fewer tales than the Egyptian tradition. It is represented in print by the so-called ''Calcutta I'' (1814–1818) and most notably by the 'Leiden edition' (1984).&lt;ref name=beaustyle&gt;Beaumont, Daniel.

Texts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written,&lt;ref name=&quot;sallis&quot;&gt;[[Eva Sallis|Sallis, Eva]]. 1999.

All extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.172872|title=The Book Of Thousand Nights And One Night Vol-ix|last1=Payne|first1=John|date=1901|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.172872/page/n317 289]|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more &quot;authentic&quot; and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as [[Muhsin Mahdi]] have suspected that this was caused in part by European demand for a &quot;complete version&quot;; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;sallis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David.

=== Printed Arabic editions ===
The first printed Arabic-language edition of the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' was published in 1775. It contained an Egyptian version of ''The Nights'' known as &quot;ZER&quot; ([[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]]'s Egyptian [[Recension]]) and 200 tales. No copy of this edition survives, but it was the basis for an 1835 edition by Bulaq, published by the Egyptian government.
[[File:Arabic manuscript with parts of Arabian Nights, collected by scholar and traveler Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, 19th century CE.jpg|thumb|Arabic manuscript with parts of Arabian Nights, collected by Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, 19th century CE, origin unknown]]
The ''Nights'' were next printed in Arabic in two volumes in Calcutta by the [[British East India Company]] in 1814–18. Each volume contained one hundred tales.

Soon after, the Prussian scholar [[Christian Habicht (historian)|Christian Maximilian Habicht]] collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create an edition containing 1001 nights both in the original Arabic and in German translation, initially in a series of eight volumes published in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in 1825–1838. A further four volumes followed in 1842–1843. In addition to the Galland manuscript, Habicht and al-Najjar used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marzolph, Ulrich 2017&quot; /&gt;

Both the ZER printing and Habicht and al-Najjar's edition influenced the next printing, a four-volume edition also from Calcutta (known as the ''Macnaghten'' or ''Calcutta II'' edition). This claimed to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (which has never been found).

A major recent edition, which reverts to the [[Syria]]n recension, is a critical edition based on the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century [[Syria]]n manuscript in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] originally used by Galland.&lt;ref name=&quot;BnF manuscript&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Mille et une nuits |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8433372b |website=Bibliothèque nationale de France |access-date=29 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by [[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1984–1994).&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousand and One Nights (Alf layla wa-layla), from the Earliest Known Sources'', ed. by Muhsin Mahdi, 3 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1984–1994), {{ISBN|9004074287}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a &quot;definitive&quot; coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the [[Mamluk]] period (a view that remains contentious).&lt;ref name=&quot;sallis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Dobie, 2009. Translation in the contact zone: Antoine Galland's Mille et une nuits: contes arabes. p. 37. In [[Saree Makdisi|Makdisi, Saree]] and [[Felicity Nussbaum]] (eds.): &quot;The Arabian Nights in Historical Context: Between East and West&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;irw&quot;&gt;Irwin, Robert. 2004. The Arabian nights: a companion. pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of &quot;the only ''real'' Arabian Nights&quot; recognize it as being the best source on the original ''style'' and linguistic form of the mediaeval work.&lt;ref name=&quot;beaustyle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;irwstyle&quot; /&gt;

In 1997, a further Arabic edition appeared, containing from the Arabian Nights transcribed from a seventeenth-century manuscript in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;''Alf laylah wa-laylah: bi-al-ʻāmmīyah al-Miṣrīyah: layālī al-ḥubb wa-al-ʻishq'', ed. by Hishām ʻAbd al-ʻAzīz and ʻĀdil ʻAbd al-Ḥamīd (Cairo: Dār al-Khayyāl, 1997), {{ISBN|9771922521}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern translations===
{{main|Translations of One Thousand and One Nights}}
[[File:William-Strang-Sindbad-AliBaba-titlepage.JPG|thumb|''Sindbad the sailor and Ali Baba and the forty thieves'' by [[William Strang]], 1896]]
The first European version (1704–1717) was translated into [[French language|French]] by [[Antoine Galland]] from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, ''[[Les mille et une nuits|Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français]]'' ('The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French'), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. &quot;[[Aladdin's lamp|Aladdin's Lamp]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]&quot; (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from the Christian Maronite storyteller [[Hanna Diyab|Hanna Diab]] during Diab's visit to Paris. Galland's version of the ''Nights'' was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.

As scholars were looking for the presumed &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;original&quot; form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the &quot;standard version&quot;. The first translations of this kind, such as that of [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were [[bowdlerized]]. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882, nine volumes), and then by [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], entitled ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885, ten volumes)&amp;nbsp;– the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=sallis2/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. The Arabian nights encyclopedia, Volume 1. pp. 506–08&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;) and the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'', which were printed between 1886 and 1888.  It has, however, been criticized for its &quot;archaic language and extravagant idiom&quot; and &quot;obsessive focus on sexuality&quot; (and has even been called an &quot;eccentric [[wikt:ego-trip|ego-trip]]&quot; and a &quot;highly personal reworking of the text&quot;).&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;

Later versions of the ''Nights'' include that of the [[French people|French]] doctor [[J. C. Mardrus]], issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by [[Powys Mathers]], and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.&lt;ref name=sallis2&gt;Sallis, Eva. 1999.

During her son's fame, Ruth was known by the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan231&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was nicknamed &quot;Samson&quot; by the hospital nurses because he weighed {{convert|11|lb|6|oz|kg}} at birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;At80&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html |title=Eastwood at 80 |last1=Amara |first1=Pavan |last2=Sundberg |first2=Charlotte |date=May 30, 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429000329/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/eastwood-at-80-1986872.html |archivedate=April 29, 2019 |location=London |url-status=dead|access-date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 08&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Day |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama |title=Gentle Man Clint |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 2, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624093445/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/clint-eastwood-drama |archivedate=June 24, 2018 |location=London |url-status=dead|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger sister, Jeanne Bernhardt (b. 1934).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot14&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He is descended from ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[William Bradford (governor)|William Bradford]], and through this line is the 12th generation born in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mayflowerhistory.com/famous-descendants |title=Famous Descendants |work=MayflowerHistory.com |accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zmi12&quot;&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; His family relocated three times during the 1930s as his father changed occupations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot15&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leung |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/03/Sunday/main671541.shtml |title=Two Sides of Clint Eastwood: Lesley Stahl Talks To Oscar-Nominated Actor And Director |work=[[CBS Evening News]] |date=February 6, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725201237/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/03/sunday/main671541.shtml |archivedate=July 25, 2013 |url-status=dead|access-date=August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; residing in [[Sacramento]] in 1935, according to census records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K9ZR-ZFG|title=Clinton Eastwood in household of Clinton Eastwood, &quot;United States Census, 1940&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9MT-VSMG?i=10&amp;personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AK9ZR-ZFG|title=United States Census, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what Eastwood has indicated in media interviews, they did not move between 1940 and 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan34&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan40&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in [[Piedmont, California]], the Eastwoods lived in an affluent area of the town, had a swimming pool, belonged to a [[country club]], and each parent drove their own car.&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=Sondra |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly – A Hollywood Journey |publisher=William Morrow and Company |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-688-15462-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's father was a manufacturing executive at [[Georgia-Pacific]] for most of his working life.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan191&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; As Clint and Jeanne grew older, Ruth took a clerical job at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan38&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood attended [[Piedmont Middle School]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cah123&quot;&gt;Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 123 (interviewer Tim Cahill)&lt;/ref&gt; where he was held back due to poor academic scores, and records indicated he also had to attend summer school.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan34&quot; /&gt; From January 1945 until at least January 1946, he attended [[Piedmont High School (California)|Piedmont High School]], but was asked to leave for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard and for burning an [[effigy]] on the school lawn, on top of other school infractions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan36&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to [[Oakland Technical High School]] and was scheduled to graduate mid-year in January 1949, although it is not clear if he did.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan40&quot; /&gt; &quot;Clint graduated from the airplane shop.

Biographer [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]] notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan40&quot; /&gt;

Eastwood held a number of jobs, including lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot17&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood said that he tried to enroll at [[Seattle University]] in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eastwood |first1=Clint |title=Eastwood: In His Own Words |url=http://www.clinteastwood.net/ownwords |website=ClinteastWood.net |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead was drafted into the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot1819&quot;&gt;Eliot, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He always dropped the Korean War reference, hoping everyone would conclude that he was in combat and might be some sort of hero.

[[file:Clint Eastwood Nina Foch Rawhide 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastwood alongside [[Nina Foch]] in an episode of ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', 1959]]
According to a CBS press release for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan52&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; although this is disputed by Eastwood's unauthorized biographer, Patrick McGilligan.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG53&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan52&quot; /&gt; While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan52&quot; /&gt; Glassberg arranged for an audition under [[Arthur Lubin]], who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature, then 6'4&quot; (193&amp;nbsp;cm), disapproved of his acting, remarking, &quot;He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan60&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan60&quot; /&gt; After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' but was rejected by [[Joseph Pevney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan63&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]] in ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955), a sequel to the recently released ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan64&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'', won a role in February 1955, playing &quot;Jonesy&quot;, a sailor in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', where he played a squadron pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald &amp; Magers, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with ''Law Man'', also known as ''[[Star in the Dust]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan81&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2, 1955, on [[NBC]]'s ''Allen in Movieland'', which starred comedian [[Steve Allen]], actor [[Tony Curtis]] and swing musician [[Benny Goodman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan86&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot36&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood was cast as Tom in ''[[Star in the Dust]]'' (1956) with [[Richard Boone]]. He joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in ''[[The First Traveling Saleslady]]'' (1956) and later hired him for ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'' (1957), without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan85&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; On his financial advisor [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]]'s advice, he switched to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Reader's Digest'' series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a ''[[Highway Patrol (American TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'' episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan85&quot; /&gt; In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in ''[[The West Point Story (TV series)|West Point]]'' series and a suicidal gold prospector on ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan87&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of ''[[Navy Log]]'' and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as Red Hardigan on ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' opposite [[James Garner]] as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan87&quot; /&gt; Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' (1958) and played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in ''[[Ambush at Cimarron Pass]]'' (also 1958), a film Eastwood considers the low point of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan93&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hourlong western series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', the career breakthrough he had long sought.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan95&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot45&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and cloddish for Eastwood's comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miller, Kenneth |url=http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/ |title=RD Face to Face: Clint Eastwood |publisher=Reader's Digest Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726195125/http://www.readersdigest.com.au/content/rd-face-to-face-clint-eastwood/ |archivedate=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (1996), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It took just three weeks for ''Rawhide'' to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an [[Emmy]], it was a major success for several years, and peaked at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan110&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rawhide'' years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of 12 hours a day, but some directors still criticized him for not working hard enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan110&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan111&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1963, ''Rawhide'' was beginning to decline in the ratings and lack freshness in the scripts; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965–66 season.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, but was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of ''Rawhide''{{'}}s cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s ===
[[file:Eastwood Publicity Still 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastwood in the 1960s]]
In late 1963, Eastwood's ''Rawhide'' co-star [[Eric Fleming]] rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964), filmed in a remote region of Spain by a relatively unknown director, [[Sergio Leone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McG126&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his ''Rawhide'' image. He signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks' work, with a bonus of a [[Mercedes-Benz]] automobile upon completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot59&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG128&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to ''A Fistful of Dollars'': &quot;In ''Rawhide'' I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an antihero.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the &quot;mask&quot; he was attempting to create for the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG131&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[Spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; and he was rehired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the trilogy's final film, ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG148&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production, ''[[The Witches (1967 film)|The Witches]]'' (''Le Streghe'', 1967), opposite De Laurentiis's wife, [[Silvana Mangano]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McG150&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's 19-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please critics; one wrote, &quot;no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG151&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later Eastwood began work on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. &quot;I know about these things,&quot; he said. &quot;Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG156&quot;&gt;McGillagan, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word &quot;Vaya!&quot; resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG156&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing ''Rawhide'' for so long. I felt the less he said, the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience.|source=Eastwood, on playing the Man with No Name character&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Dollars'' trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when ''A Fistful of Dollars'' opened on January 18, followed by ''For a Few Dollars More'' on May 10, and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' on December 29.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG157&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; All three were commercially successful, particularly ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', which eventually earned $8&amp;nbsp;million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star being ranked for the first time on [[Quigley Publishing Company|Quigley's]] [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll]] in 1968 in fifth place.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG157&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 4, 2006|page=1|last=Goldman|first=William|author-link=William Goldman|title=Clint in mint condition|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/news/clint-in-mint-condition-1117949441/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three received poor reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG158&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Crist]] described ''A Fistful of Dollars'' as &quot;cheapjack,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crist |first=Judith |title=Plain Murder All the Way |work=[[New York World Journal Tribune]] |date=February 2, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Newsweek]]'' called ''For a Few Dollars More'' &quot;excruciatingly dopey.&quot; [[Renata Adler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was &quot;the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adler |first=Renata |title=The Screen: Zane Grey Meets the Marquis de Sade |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/25/archives/the-screen-zane-grey-meets-the-marquis-de-sade-the-good-the-bad-and.html |work=The New York Times |date=January 25, 1968 |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially Eastwood's, though a few critics such as [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' praised his coolness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |title=A Fistful of Dollars (1964) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/02/archives/screen-a-fistful-of-dollars-opens-western-film-cliches-all-used-in.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 2, 1967 |accessdate=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG158&quot; /&gt;

Stardom brought Eastwood more roles. He signed to star in the American revisionist western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968) alongside [[Inger Stevens]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Ed Begley]], [[Alan Hale, Jr.]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[James MacArthur]],&lt;ref name=&quot;McG159&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG160&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned Eastwood $400,000 and 25% of its net box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG159&quot; /&gt; Using money earned from the ''Dollars'' trilogy, Eastwood's advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], named after [[Malpaso Creek]] on Eastwood's property in [[Monterey County, California]]. The 38-year-old actor was still relatively unknown as late as a month prior to the film's release, as evidenced by a July 1968 news item by syndicated columnist Dorothy Manners: &quot;The proverbial man in the street is still asking, 'Who's Clint Eastwood?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Manners, Dorothy |date=July 14, 1968 |title=Italy Made Eastwood A Hollywood Hero |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/106343899 |newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|page=117 |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard arranged for ''Hang 'Em High'' to be a joint production with United Artists;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG162&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; when it opened in August 1968, it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists' history. ''Hang 'Em High'' was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who called it &quot;a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zmi12&quot; /&gt;

Before ''Hang 'Em High'''s release, Eastwood had already begun working on ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968), about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ([[Don Stroud]]) through New York City.

Eastwood was paid $750,000 for the war epic ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968),&lt;ref name=&quot;McG172&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; about a World War II squad parachuting into a [[Gestapo]] stronghold in the alpine mountains. [[Richard Burton]] played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as [[Two-Face]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot83&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood then branched out to star in the only [[musical film|musical]] of his career, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969). Eastwood and [[Lee Marvin]] play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife ([[Jean Seberg]]) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20&amp;nbsp;million, which was high for the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG173&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a critical or commercial success, but was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paint Your Wagon (1969) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |work=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101132205/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/37096/Paint-Your-Wagon/details |archivedate=November 1, 2013 |url-status=dead  |access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
Eastwood starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in the western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), directed by Don Siegel. The film follows an American mercenary, who becomes mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun, and ends up helping a group of Juarista rebels during the reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Frayling, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood again played a mysterious stranger{{snd}}unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest, and smoking a cigar.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Although it received moderate reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;McG182&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kauffman |first=Stanley |title=Stanley Kauffman on Films |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=August 1, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; the film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000&amp;nbsp;Movies Ever Made''.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Maslin, and Nichols&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steals a fortune in gold from the Nazis, in the World War II film ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (also 1970), with [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Telly Savalas]]. ''Kelly's Heroes'' was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG184&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in July 1969 [[Filming location|on location]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG183&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti-war sentiments were recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG184&quot; /&gt; In the winter of 1969–70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' (1971), a tale of a wounded Union soldier, held captive by the sexually repressed matron (played by [[Geraldine Page]]) of a Southern girls' school.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG185&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by French critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG190&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; However, it grossed less than $1&amp;nbsp;million and, according to Eastwood and Lang, flopped due to poor publicity and the &quot;emasculated&quot; role of Eastwood.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG189&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's career reached a turning point in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG196&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan192&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn ([[Jessica Walter]]), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – [[Erroll Garner]]'s &quot;[[Misty (song)|Misty]]&quot;. When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan193&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Filming commenced in [[Monterey]] in September 1970 and included footage of that year's [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McG194&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as [[Jay Cocks]] in ''Time'' magazine, [[Andrew Sarris]] in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', and Archer Winsten in the ''New York Post'' all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG195&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), written by [[Harry Julian Fink|Harry and Rita Fink]], centers on a hard-edged New York City (later changed to San Francisco) [[Police inspector#Municipal police|police inspector]] named [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]] who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG205&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'' has been described as being arguably Eastwood's most memorable character, and the film has been credited with inventing the &quot;loose-cannon cop&quot; genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mathijs and Mendik, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood's role as Dirty Harry established the &quot;first true archetype&quot; of the action film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenfeld, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; His lines (quoted above) are regarded by firearms historians, such as Garry James and Richard Venola, as the force that catapulted the ownership of [[.44 Magnum]] revolvers to new heights in the United States; specifically the [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29]] carried by Harry Callahan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Communications2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=Jerry |title=A Line to Remember |journal=Orange Coast |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |date=March 2003 |page=23 |issn=0279-0483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dirty Harry'', released in December 1971, earned $22&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; It was Siegel's highest-grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan.

Following [[Sean Connery]]'s announcement that he would not play [[James Bond]] again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Clint Eastwood as Superman or James Bond?

During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG219&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; ''Joe Kidd'' received a mixed reception, with [[Roger Greenspun]] of ''The New York Times'' writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenspun |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Greenspun |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE6D71F31E73BBC4851DFB1668389669EDE |title=Joe Kidd (1972) |work=The New York Times |date=July 20, 1972 |accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood's first western as director was ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'' (1973), in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in ''Pale Rider''. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and [[allegory]], influenced by Leone.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG221&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box-office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was &quot;as derivative as it was expressive,&quot; with [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarking that Eastwood had &quot;absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG223&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wayne]], who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, &quot;The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Holden-Breezy.jpg|thumb|left|Directing [[William Holden]] in ''Breezy'' (1973)]]
Eastwood next turned his attention towards ''[[Breezy]]'' (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met [[Sondra Locke]] for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG229&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kay Lenz]] got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was nearly twice the character's age. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and [[Frank Stanley (cinematographer)|Frank Stanley]], came in $1&amp;nbsp;million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG230&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Breezy'' was not a major critical or commercial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan231&quot; /&gt;

Once filming of ''Breezy'' had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973), a sequel to ''Dirty Harry'', about a group of rogue young officers (among them [[David Soul]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Tim Matheson]]) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG233&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1&amp;nbsp;million in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eliot153&quot;&gt;Eliot, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG236&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' critic [[Nora Sayre]] panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's [[Frank Rich]] called it &quot;the same old stuff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG236&quot; /&gt;

Eastwood teamed up with [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[George Kennedy]] in the buddy action caper ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG241&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG241&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG240&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Film shoot for The Eiger Sanction in Zurich (10).jpg|thumb|right|At a film shoot for ''The Eiger Sanction'' (1975)]]
Eastwood's next film ''[[The Eiger Sanction (film)|The Eiger Sanction]]'' (1975) was based on [[Trevanian]]'s [[The Eiger Sanction|critically acclaimed spy novel]] of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for [[Paul Newman]], an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last &quot;sanction&quot; in return for a rare [[Pissarro]] painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the [[Eiger]] in Switzerland under perilous conditions. [[Mike Hoover]] taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at [[Yosemite]] in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in [[Grindelwald]], Switzerland on August 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McG244&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 ''The Eiger Sanction'' was marginally successful commercially, receiving $14.2&amp;nbsp;million at the box-office, and gained mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG253&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Gould Boyum of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' dismissed the film as &quot;brutal fantasy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG253&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with [[Warner Brothers]], through [[Frank Wells]], that has lasted to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG256&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Josey Wales publicity.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chief Dan George]] with Locke and Eastwood at a barbecue in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] promoting ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' (1976)]]

''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), a western inspired by [[Asa Carter]]'s 1972&amp;nbsp;novel of the same name,&lt;ref name=&quot;McG257&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerrilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the [[American Civil War]] and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. The supporting cast included Locke as his love interest and [[Chief Dan George]] as an elderly [[Cherokee]] who strikes up a friendship with Wales. Director [[Philip Kaufman]] was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 from the [[Directors Guild of America]]{{snd}}who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG264&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] during a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''. Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics, including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight; directors such as [[King Vidor]], [[William Wyler]], and [[Howard Hawks]]; and a number of academics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG266&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release in the summer of 1976 ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was widely acclaimed, with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood's role as an iconic one that related to America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG266&quot; /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the ''Dollars'' westerns and praised the film's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19760101/REVIEWS/601010306/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Outlaw Josey Wales |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 1, 1976 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116002157/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19760101%2FREVIEWS%2F601010306%2F1023 |archivedate=January 16, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would later appear in ''Time''{{'s}} &quot;Top 10 Films of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGilligan267&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood was then offered the role of [[Benjamin L. Willard]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola's]] ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG268&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitses, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; He also refused the part of a platoon leader in [[Ted Post]]'s [[Vietnam War]] film, ''[[Go Tell the Spartans]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;McG268&quot; /&gt; and instead decided to make a third ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[The Enforcer (1976 film)|The Enforcer]]'' (1976). The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ([[Tyne Daly]]) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. The film, culminating in a shootout on [[Alcatraz]] island, was considerably shorter than the previous ''Dirty Harry'' films at 95{{nbsp}}minutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;McG273&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; but was a major commercial success grossing $100&amp;nbsp;million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG278&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' (1977) opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. In this film, he portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the [[organized crime|mob]]. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it &quot;classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19770101/REVIEWS/701010304/1023 |title=The Gauntlet |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 1, 1977 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612184015/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19770101%2FREVIEWS%2F701010304%2F1023 |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Every Which Way but Loose]]'' (1978) he has an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. His character, Philo Beddoe, is a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his best friend, Orville Boggs (played by [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]) and an [[orangutan]] called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box-office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;McG302&quot;&gt;McGilligan, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood starred in ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the last of his films directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Lee Morris]] who, along with [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], escaped from the notorious [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] in 1962. The film was a major success; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised it as &quot;crystalline cinema&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Rich of ''Time'' described it as &quot;cool, cinematic grace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===

Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'' (1982), based on the eponymous [[Clancy Carlile]]'s [[Great Depression|depression-era]] novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from [[tuberculosis]], but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son [[Kyle Eastwood|Kyle]]) to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he is supposed to record a song. Only ''Time'' gave the film a good review in the United States, with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the film received a more positive reception in France, where it was compared to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93{{nbsp}}percent on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/honkytonk_man |title=Honkytonk Man (1982) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in the [[Cold War]]-themed ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' (also 1982). Based on a 1977 [[Firefox (novel)|novel with the same name]] written by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], the film was shot before but released after ''Honkytonk Man''. Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War, and the film had to be shot in [[Vienna]] and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations. With a production cost of $20&amp;nbsp;million, it was Eastwood's highest budget film to that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schickel378&quot;&gt;Schickel, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine likened Eastwood's performance to &quot;[[Luke Skywalker]] trapped in Dirty Harry's Soul&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schickel378&quot; /&gt;

Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth ''Dirty Harry'' film, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'', which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and released that December. It is considered the darkest and most violent of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Zmijewsky and Pfeiffer, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Eastwood received 60&amp;nbsp;percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sudden Impact'' was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line &quot;[[Go ahead, make my day]]&quot; (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to Congress, and used during the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |title=Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give A Damn |publisher=[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313150615/http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes100.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead  |access-date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogin, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the second most commercially successful of the ''Dirty Harry'' films, after ''The Enforcer'', earning $70&amp;nbsp;million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.&lt;ref&gt;McGilligan, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout August Lumumba increasingly withdrew from his full cabinet and instead consulted with officials and ministers he trusted, such as Mpolo, Mbuyi, Kashamura, Gizenga, and Kiwewa.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=188}} Lumumba's office was in disarray, and few members of his staff did any work.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=188}} His ''chef de cabinet'', Damien Kandolo, was often absent and acted as a spy on behalf of the Belgian government.{{sfn|Willame|1990|pp=224–225}} Lumumba was constantly being delivered rumors from informants and the [[Sûreté]], encouraging him to grow deeply suspicious of others.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=188}} In an attempt to keep him informed, Michel &lt;!-- who? --&gt;enlisted the assistance of three Belgian [[telex]] operators, who supplied him with copies of all outgoing journalistic dispatches.{{sfn|Willame|1990|p=214}}

Lumumba immediately ordered Congolese troops to put down the rebellion in South Kasai, which was home to strategic rail links necessary for a campaign in Katanga. [[Invasion of South Kasai|The operation]] was successful, but the conflict soon devolved into ethnic violence. The army became involved in massacres of [[Luba people|Luba]] civilians. The people and politicians of South Kasai held Lumumba personally responsible for the actions of the army. Kasa-Vubu publicly announced that only a [[Federalism|federalist]] government could bring peace and stability to the Congo. This broke his tenuous political alliance with Lumumba and tilted the political favour in the country away from Lumumba's [[unitary state]].&lt;ref name= gondola123&gt;{{harvnb|Gondola|2002|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic tensions rose against him (especially around Leopoldville), and the [[Catholic Church]], still powerful in the country, openly criticised his government.&lt;ref name= gondola124&gt;{{harvnb|Gondola|2002|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with South Kasai subdued, the Congo lacked the necessary strength to retake Katanga. Lumumba had summoned an African conference in Leopoldville from 25–31 August, but no foreign heads of state appeared and no country pledged military support.&lt;ref name= young324&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumumba demanded once again that UN peacekeeping soldiers assist in suppressing the revolt, threatening to bring in Soviet troops if they refused. The UN subsequently denied Lumumba the use of its forces. The possibility of a direct Soviet intervention was thought increasingly likely.

==Dismissal==
{{main|Dissolution of the Lumumba Government}}

=== Kasa-Vubu's revocation order ===
President Kasa-Vubu began fearing a Lumumbist [[coup d'état]] would take place.{{efn|There is sufficient evidence to suggest that Lumumba was growing impatient with the Parliamentary system and was seeking alternatives to achieve his agenda. At the same time, he did not begin to plan for a coup until he grew suspicious of his opponents' intentions to depose him.&lt;ref name= young329/&gt;}} On the evening of 5 September, Kasa-Vubu announced over radio that he had dismissed Lumumba and six of his ministers from the government for the massacres in South Kasai and for involving the Soviets in the Congo.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja108/&gt; Upon hearing the broadcast, Lumumba went to the national radio station, which was under UN guard. Though they had been ordered to bar Lumumba's entry, the UN troops allowed the prime minister in, as they had no specific instructions to use force against him. Lumumba denounced his dismissal over the radio as illegitimate, and in turn labeled Kasa-Vubu a traitor and declared him deposed.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|pp=26–27}} Kasa-Vubu had not declared the approval of any responsible ministers of his decision, making his action legally invalid.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|p=100}}{{efn|Article 22 of the Loi Fondamentale read, &quot;The President names and revokes the Prime Minister.&quot; There was no elaboration on the point, and nowhere else in the document were the nature or limits of the power explained, including whether or not parliamentary approval was necessary.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=35}} However, it was stipulated that any action undertaken by the President had to be countersigned by a minister responsible to Parliament. This provision was interpreted to extend to Kasa-Vubu's order.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|p=100}}}} Lumumba noted this in a letter to Hammarskjöld and a radio broadcast at 05:30 on 6 September. Later that day Kasa-Vubu managed to secure the countersignatures to his order of Albert Delvaux, Minister Resident in Belgium, and [[Justin Marie Bomboko]], Minister of Foreign Affairs. With them, he announced again his dismissal of Lumumba and six other ministers at 16:00 over Brazzaville radio.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|p=101}}

Lumumba and the ministers who remained loyal to him ordered the arrest of Delvaux and Bomboko for countersigning the dismissal order. The latter sought refuge in the presidential palace (which was guarded by UN peacekeepers), but early in the morning on 7 September, the former was detained and confined in the Prime Minister's residence.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=292}}{{efn|Lumumba denied having authorised the arrests and issued an apology before the Chamber.{{sfn|Willame|1990|p=398}}}} Meanwhile, the Chamber convened to discuss Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order and hear Lumumba's reply. Delvaux made an unexpected appearance and took to the dais to denounce his arrest and declare his resignation from the government. He was enthusiastically applauded by the opposition. Lumumba then delivered his speech.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|pp=292–293}} Instead of directly attacking Kasa-Vubu ''[[ad hominem]]'', Lumumba accused obstructionist politicians and ABAKO of using the presidency as a front for disguising their activities. He noted that Kasa-Vubu had never before offered any criticism of the government and portrayed their relationship as one of cooperation. He lambasted Delvaux and Minister of Finance [[Pascal Nkayi]] for their role in the Geneva negotiations and for their failure to consult the rest of the government. Lumumba followed his arguments with an analysis of the Loi Fondemental and finished by asking Parliament to assemble a &quot;commission of sages&quot; to examine the Congo's troubles.{{sfn|Willame|1990|pp=399–400}}

The Chamber, at the suggestion of its presiding officer, voted to annul both Kasa-Vubu's and Lumumba's declarations of dismissal, 60 to 19. The following day Lumumba delivered a similar speech before the Senate, which subsequently delivered the government a vote of confidence, 49 to zero with seven abstentions.{{sfn|Willame|1990|p=400}}{{efn|According to de Witte, the vote was tallied as 41 to two with six abstentions.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|pp=22–23}}}} According to Article 51, Parliament was granted the &quot;exclusive privilege&quot; to interpret the constitution.{{sfn|Okumu|1963|p=186}} In cases of doubt and controversy, the Congolese were originally supposed to appeal constitutional questions to the Belgian [[Council of State (Belgium)|Conseil d'État]]. With the rupture of relations in July this was no longer possible, so no authoritative interpretation or mediation was available to bring a legal resolution to the dispute.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=36}}{{efn|De Witte described Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order as &quot;clearly not constitutional&quot; and labeled the invoked Article 22 as a &quot;totally obsolete&quot; provision which could only be resolved &quot;by a law or revision of the constitution, passed by a parliament with confidence in Lumumba.&quot; [[Evan Luard]] wrote, &quot;Of Kasa-Vubu's move [...] it can reasonably be said that by the way he used his power without referring to Parliament amounted to an abuse of the constitution&quot;.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=22}} Gerard and Kuklick noted that in August 1960 Baudouin, operating within the confines of the extremely similar Belgian Constitution, had asked Prime Minister Eyskens to resign, but that Eyskens, having a solid parliamentary majority, refused and retained his office.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|pp=99–100}}}}

Numerous African diplomats and newly appointed ONUC head [[Rajeshwar Dayal]] attempted to get the president and prime minister to reconcile their differences, but failed.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja108&gt;{{harvnb|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September, the Parliament held a joint session between the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Though several members short of a [[quorum]], they voted to grant Lumumba emergency powers.&lt;ref name= young329&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobutu's coup ===
On 14 September Mobutu announced over the radio that he was launching a '[[1960 Republic of the Congo coup d'état|peaceful revolution]]' to break the political impasse and therefore neutralising the President, Lumumba's and Iléo's respective governments, and Parliament until 31 December. He stated that &quot;[[technocracy|technicians]]&quot; would run the administration while the politicians sorted out their differences. In a subsequent press conference, he clarified that Congolese university graduates would be asked to form a government, and further declared that all Eastern Bloc countries should close their embassies. Lumumba was surprised by the coup{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=214}}{{efn|Various sources state Mobutu's action was encouraged and supported by Belgium and the United States.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=214}}}} and that evening he traveled to Camp Leopold II in search of Mobutu to try and change his mind. He spent the night there but was attacked in the morning by Luba soldiers, who blamed him for the atrocities in South Kasaï. A Ghanaian ONUC contingent managed to extricate him, but his briefcase was left behind. Some of his political opponents recovered it and published documents it supposedly contained, including letters from Nkrumah, appeals for support addressed to the Soviet Union and the [[People's Republic of China]], a memorandum dated 16 September declaring the presence of Soviet troops within one week, and a letter dated 15 September from Lumumba to the provincial presidents (Tshombe excepted) entitled &quot;Measures to be applied during the first stages of the dictatorship&quot;. Some of these papers were genuine, while others, especially the memorandum and the letter to the provincial presidents, were almost certainly forgeries.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=216}}

Despite the coup, African diplomats still worked towards a reconciliation between Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu. According to the Ghanaians, a verbal agreement of principle concerning closer co-operation between the Head of State and the government was put into writing. Lumumba signed it, but Kasa-Vubu suddenly refused to reciprocate. The Ghanaians suspected that Belgium and the United States were responsible. Kasa-Vubu was eager to re-integrate Katanga back into the Congo through negotiation, and Tshombe had declared that he would not participate in any discussions with a government that included the &quot;communist&quot; Lumumba.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=221–222}}

After consultation with Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba, Mobutu announced that he would summon a round table conference to discuss the political future of the Congo. His attempts to follow through were disrupted by Lumumba who, from his official residence, was acting as though he still held the premiership. He continued to hold meetings with members of his government, senators, deputies, and political supporters, and to issue public statements. On numerous occasions he left his residence to tour the restaurants of the capital, maintaining that he still held power.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=34}} Frustrated by the way he was being treated by Lumumba and facing intense political pressure, by the end of the month Mobutu was no longer encouraging reconciliation; he had aligned with Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=222}} He ordered ANC units to surround Lumumba's residence, but a cordon of UN peacekeepers prevented them from making an arrest. Lumumba was confined to his home.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=266}} On 7 October Lumumba announced the formation of a new government that included Bolikango and Kalonji, but he later proposed that the UN supervise a national referendum that would settle the split in the government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=35}}

On 24 November, the UN voted to recognize Mobutu's new delegates to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], disregarding Lumumba's original appointees. Lumumba resolved to join Deputy Prime Minister [[Antoine Gizenga]] in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] and lead a campaign to regain power.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja110&gt;{{harvnb|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November he left the capital in a convoy of nine cars with [[Rémy Mwamba]], [[Pierre Mulele]], his wife Pauline, and his youngest child. Instead of heading with all haste to the Orientale Province border—where soldiers loyal to Gizenga were waiting to receive him—Lumumba delayed by touring villages and making conversation with the locals. On 1 December Mobutu's troops caught up with his party as it crossed the [[Sankuru river]]{{sfn|Kanza|1994|pp=318–319}} in Lodi.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja110/&gt; Lumumba and his advisers had made it to the far side, but his wife and child were left to be captured on the bank. Fearing for their safety, Lumumba took the ferry back, against the advice of Mwamba and Mulele, who both, fearing they would never see him again, bid him farewell. Mobutu's men arrested him.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|pp=318–319}} He was moved to [[Ilebo|Port Francqui]] the next day and flown back to Léopoldville.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja110/&gt; Mobutu claimed Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes.

===UN response===
[[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] made an appeal to Kasa-Vubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to [[due process]]. The [[Soviet Union]] denounced Hammarskjöld and the [[First World]] as responsible for Lumumba's arrest and demanded his release.

The [[United Nations Security Council]] was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. The Soviets also requested the immediate resignation of Hammarskjöld, the arrests of Mobutu and Tshombe, and the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces.&lt;ref name= bbc_1961/&gt; Hammarskjöld, answering Soviet criticism of his Congo operations, said that if the UN forces were withdrawn from the Congo, &quot;I fear everything will crumble.&quot;

The threat to the UN cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their contingents by [[Yugoslavia]], the [[United Arab Republic]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Indonesia]], [[Morocco]], and [[Guinea]]. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8–2. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskjöld increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union.

==Final days and execution==
[[File:Lumumba arrested.jpg|thumb|Lumumba (center) before transport to Thysville]]
Lumumba was sent first on 3 December 1960 to [[Mbanza-Ngungu|Thysville]] military barracks Camp Hardy, 150&amp;nbsp;km (about 100 miles) from Léopoldville. He was accompanied by [[Maurice Mpolo]] and [[Joseph Okito]], two political associates who had planned to assist him in setting up a new government. They were fed poorly by the prison guards, as per Mobutu's orders. In Lumumba's last documented letter, he wrote to Rajeshwar Dayal: &quot;in a word, we are living amid absolutely impossible conditions; moreover, they are against the law&quot;.&lt;ref name= washington/&gt;

In the morning of 13 January 1961, discipline at Camp Hardy faltered. Soldiers refused to work unless they were paid; they received a total of 400,000 francs ($8,000) from the Katanga Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Katanga's Communique on the Killing of Lumumba|date=14 February 1961|work=New York Times|id = {{ProQuest|115317883}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supported Lumumba's release, while others thought he was dangerous. Kasa-Vubu, Mobutu, Foreign Minister [[Justin Marie Bomboko]], and Head of Security Services [[Victor Nendaka]] personally arrived at the camp and negotiated with the troops. Conflict was avoided, but it became apparent that holding a controversial prisoner in the camp was too great a risk.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|p=195}} [[Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden]], the last Belgian [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Minister of the Colonies]], ordered that Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito be taken to the [[State of Katanga]].&lt;ref name= gondola126&gt;{{harvnb|Gondola|2002|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that night, Lumumba was driven to an isolated spot where three firing squads had been assembled. A Belgian commission of inquiry found that the execution was carried out by Katanga's authorities. It reported that President Tshombe and two other ministers were present, with four Belgian officers under the command of Katangan authorities. Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito were lined up against a tree and shot one at a time. The execution is thought to have taken place on 17 January 1961, between 21:40 and 21:43 (according to the Belgian report). The Belgians and their counterparts later wished to get rid of the bodies, and did so by digging up and dismembering the corpses, then dissolving them in sulfuric acid while the bones were ground and scattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No statement was released until three weeks later, despite rumours that Lumumba was dead. On 10 February, the radio announced that Lumumba and two other prisoners had escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New York Times|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|date=Feb 1961|id = {{ProQuest|115365584}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was formally announced over Katangan radio on 13 February: it was alleged that he was killed by enraged villagers three days after escaping from Kolatey prison farm.&lt;ref name= bbc_1961&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/13/newsid_2541000/2541053.stm| title = 1961: Ex-Congo PM declared dead| website = news.bbc.co.uk| publisher =[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of Lumumba's death, street protests were organized in several European countries; in [[Belgrade]], protesters sacked the Belgian embassy and confronted the police, and in [[London]], a crowd marched from [[Trafalgar Square]] to the Belgian embassy, where a letter of protest was delivered and where protesters clashed with police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2748000/2748931.stm |title=BBC: &quot;1961: Lumumba rally clashes with UK police&quot; |work=BBC News |date=19 February 2001 |access-date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York City]], a demonstration at the [[United Nations Security Council]] turned violent and spilled over into the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahoney|title=JFK|date=1983|page= 72|quote=&quot;In the United States, the news of Lumumba's murder provoked racial riots.

==Foreign involvement in his murder==
Both Belgium and the US were affected by the Cold War in their attitude to Lumumba, as they feared he was increasingly subject to communist influence. They thought he was gravitating toward the Soviet Union, although, according to [[Sean Kelly (journalist)|Sean Kelly]], who covered the events as a correspondent for the [[Voice of America]], that was not because Lumumba was a communist, but because he felt that USSR was the only power which would support his country's effort to rid itself of colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Kelly, ''America's Tyrant: The CIA and Mobutu of Zaire'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The US was the first country from which Lumumba requested help.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Lumumba, for his part, denied being a communist, and said that he found colonialism and communism to be equally deplorable. He professed his personal preference for neutrality between the [[Eastern Bloc|East]] and [[Western Bloc|West]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgian involvement===
On 18 January, panicked by reports that the burial of the three bodies had been observed, members of the execution team dug up the remains and moved them for reburial to a place near the border with [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Belgian Police Commissioner Gerard Soete later admitted in several accounts that he and his brother led the original exhumation. Police Commissioner Frans Verscheure also took part. On the afternoon and evening of 21 January, Commissioner Soete and his brother dug up Lumumba's corpse for a second time, cut it up with a hacksaw, and dissolved it in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].{{sfn|de Witte |2002|pp=140–143}}&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/patrice.htm |title=Patrice Lumumba – Mysteries of History |publisher=Usnews.com |access-date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th and early 21st century, Lumumba's assassination was investigated. In a 1999 interview on Belgian television, in a program about his assassination, Soete displayed a bullet and two teeth that he claimed he had saved from Lumumba's body.&lt;ref name=usnews /&gt; According to the 2001 Belgian Commission investigating Lumumba's assassination: (1) Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested, (2) Belgium was not particularly concerned with Lumumba's physical well being, and (3) although informed of the danger to Lumumba's life, Belgium did not take any action to avert his death. The report concluded that Belgium had not ordered Lumumba's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E4DF123BF934A25752C1A9679C8B63 |title=Report Reproves Belgium in Lumumba's Death |location=Belgium; Congo (Formerly Zaire) |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 November 2001 |access-date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, the Belgian government formally apologized to the Congolese people, and admitted to a &quot;moral responsibility&quot; and &quot;an irrefutable portion of responsibility in the events that led to the death of Lumumba&quot;.&lt;ref name=Apology&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/06/world/world-briefing-europe-belgium-apology-for-lumumba-killing.html World Briefing | Europe: Belgium: Apology For Lumumba Killing]&quot;, ''New York Times'', 6 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalb points out in her book, ''Congo Cables'', the record shows that many communications by Devlin at the time urged elimination of Lumumba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Congo Cables: The Cold War in Africa—from Eisenhower to Kennedy |first= Madeleine G. |last= Kalb |publisher= Macmillan |year= 1982 |pages= 53, 101, 129–133, 149–152, 158–159, 184–185, 195 |isbn= 978-0-02-560620-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the CIA station chief helped to direct the search to capture Lumumba for transfer to his enemies in Katanga. Devlin was involved in arranging Lumumba's transfer to Katanga,&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Michael P. (2000). ''Captive in the Congo: A Consul's Return to the Heart of Darkness''. Naval Institute Press. p.&amp;nbsp;158. {{ISBN|978-1-55750-323-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the CIA base chief in Elizabethville was in direct touch with the killers the night Lumumba was killed. [[John Stockwell (CIA officer) | John Stockwell]], a CIA officer in the Congo and later a CIA station chief, wrote in 1978 that a CIA agent had the body in the trunk of his car in order to try to get rid of it.&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, John (1978). ''In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story''. W.W. Norton. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-0-393-00926-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockwell, who knew Devlin well, believed that Devlin knew more than anyone else about the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell (1978). pp. 71–72, 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[inauguration of John F. Kennedy]] in January 1961 caused fear among Mobutu's faction, and within the CIA, that the incoming Democratic administration would favor the imprisoned Lumumba.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, ''JFK'' (1983), pp. 69–70. &quot;The Kasavubu-Mobutu regime began to consider the Kennedy administration a threat to its very survival. The Kennedy plan was seen as evidence of &quot;a new and unexpected solidarity with the Casablanca powers ... (the radical [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] African governments that supported Lumumba). The CIA station in Léopoldville bore much of the responsibility for the rupture. It had opposed any political solution to the power struggle and, worse, had fortified the resolve of Kasavubu and Mobutu, Nendaka, and the rest to use violence against others to save themselves. [...] The effect was tragic: reports that the incoming administration planned to liberate the imprisoned Lumumba on the one hand, and the CIA's deadly urgings on the other, acted like a closing vice on the desperate men in Léopoldville.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While awaiting his presidential inauguration, Kennedy had come to believe that Lumumba should be released from custody, though not be allowed to return to power. Lumumba was killed three days before Kennedy's inauguration on 20 January, though Kennedy did not learn of the killing until 13 February.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, ''JFK'' (1983), p. 70. Quote: &quot;White House photographer Jacques Lowe caught Kennedy, horror-struck with head in hand, receiving the first news by telephone a full four weeks later on 13 February. All the anguished searching for a way around Lumumba had been for naught. Forty-eight hours before Kennedy had even taken the presidential oath, Lumumba was already dead.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Church Committee ====
In 1975, the [[Church Committee]] went on record with the finding that CIA chief [[Allen Dulles]] had ordered Lumumba's assassination as &quot;an urgent and prime objective&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In Dulles' own words; William Blum, ''Killing Hope''. MBI Publishing Co., 2007: p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0-7603-2457-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, declassified CIA [[telegram|cables]] quoted or mentioned in the Church report, and in Kalb (1982), mention two specific CIA plots to murder Lumumba: the poison plot and a shooting plot.

The Committee later found that while the CIA had conspired to kill Lumumba, it was not directly involved in the murder.&lt;ref name=Kettle&gt;Martin Kettle, &quot;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/10/martinkettle President 'ordered murder' of Congo leader]&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 9 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== U.S. government documents ====
In the early 21st century, declassified documents revealed that the CIA had plotted to assassinate Lumumba. The documents indicate that the Congolese leaders who killed Lumumba, including [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], received money and weapons directly from the CIA.&lt;ref name=&quot;USN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weissman&gt;Stephen Weissman, &quot;[http://www.udel.edu/globalagenda/2003/student/readings/CIAlumumba.html Opening the Secret Files on Lumumba's Murder]&quot;, ''Washington Post'', 21 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The same disclosure showed that, at the time, the U.S. government believed that Lumumba was a communist, and feared him because of what it considered the threat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Blaine Harden, ''Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a newly declassified interview with Robert Johnson, who was the minutekeeper of the [[U.S. National Security Council]] at the time in question, revealed that U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] had said &quot;something [to CIA chief [[Allen Dulles]]] to the effect that Lumumba should be eliminated&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kettle/&gt; The interview from the Senate Intelligence Committee's inquiry on covert action was released in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Martin| last= Kettle| title= President 'ordered murder' of Congo leader| date= 9 August 2000| access-date= 18 January 2017| newspaper= The Guardian| url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/10/martinkettle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the U.S. State Department admitted that President Eisenhower authorized the murder of Lumumba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v23/d1|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XXIII, Congo, 1960–1968 – Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, documents released in 2017 revealed that an American role in Lumumba's murder was only under consideration by the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFK Assassination System Identification Form |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32112745.pdf |access-date=15 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/26/jfk-files-released-assassination-documents-conspiracy-theories|title=Government releases classified JFK assassination documents – as it happened|first=Alan|last=Yuhas|date=27 October 2017|access-date=17 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIA Chief Allan Dulles had allocated $100,000 to accomplish the act, but the plan was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Herbert F.| last= Weiss| title= Review &quot;INSIDE THE CIA: CONGO IN THE 1980s&quot;, of book by Larry Devlin.

===British involvement===
In April 2013, in a letter to the ''[[London Review of Books]],'' British parliamentarian [[David Lea, Baron Lea of Crondall|David Lea]] reported having discussed Lumumba's death with [[MI6]] officer [[Daphne Park, Baroness Park of Monmouth|Daphne Park]] shortly before she died in March 2010. Park had been posted to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] at the time of Lumumba's death, and was later a semi-official spokesperson for [[MI6]] in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;Ben Quinn, &quot;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/mi6-patrice-lumumba-assassination MI6 'arranged Cold War killing' of Congo prime minister]&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 1 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lea, when he mentioned &quot;the uproar&quot; surrounding Lumumba's abduction and murder, and recalled the theory that MI6 might have had &quot;something to do with it&quot;, Park replied, &quot;We did. I organised it.&quot;&lt;ref name=wedidit&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n07/letters Letters], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 11 April 2013, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that, subsequently, &quot;[[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]] sources&quot; described the claims of MI6 involvement as &quot;speculative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22006446 &quot;MI6 and the death of Patrice Lumumba&quot;], BBC News, 2 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ideology and rhetoric==
Lumumba did not espouse a comprehensive political or economic platform.{{sfn|Stack|1964|p=141}} He was the first Congolese to articulate a narrative of the Congo that contradicted traditional Belgian views of [[colonisation]], and he highlighted the suffering of the indigenous population under European rule. Lumumba was alone among his contemporaries in encompassing all Congolese people in his narrative (the others confined their discussions to their respective ethnicities or regions),{{sfn|Goff|2004|p=129}} and he offered a basis for national identity that was predicated upon having survived colonial victimisation, as well as the people's innate dignity, humanity, strength, and unity.{{sfn|Goff|2004|p=130}} Lumumba's ideal of [[humanism]] included the values of [[egalitarianism]], [[social justice]], [[liberty]], and the recognition of [[fundamental rights]]. He viewed the state as a positive advocate for the [[public welfare]] and its intervention in Congolese society necessary to ensure equality, justice, and social harmony.&lt;ref name= lavdc&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lavdc.net/portail/analyse-de-lheritage-politique-et-ideologique-de-patrice-emery-lumumba/| title = Analyse de L'Héritage Politique et Idéologique de Patrice Emery Lumumba.| last = Kayembe| first = Don| date = 2 July 2013| website = LAVD Congo| access-date = 10 April 2018| language = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Despite his brief political career and tragic death—or perhaps because of them—Lumumba entered history through the front door: he became both a flag and a symbol. He lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] for Ghana, [[Mao Tse-tung]] for China, and Lenin for Russia.|[[Thomas Kanza]], friend and colleague of Lumumba, 1972{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=10}}}}

===Historiography===
In the years after his death, misconceptions of Lumumba persisted by both his supporters and his critics.{{sfn|Howe|1968|p=592}}{{efn|Journalist [[Russell Warren Howe]] listed multiple popular &quot;illusions&quot; about Lumumba in 1968: &quot;Lumumba was a radical revolutionary (his admirers' view) or a member of a Moscow- and Nkrumah-inspired conspiracy (his critics' image); he had broad national support and an electoral majority (his admirers); he sought to oust Western finance and socialize the economy (his critics); he was more 'African', less 'European' than his rival Kasa-Vubu (his admirers); he is a living force in Congolese politics, the father of Congolese nationalism (his admirers again).&quot;{{sfn|Howe|1968|p=592}}}} Academic discussion of his legacy was largely limited until the later stages of Mobutu's rule in the Congo.{{sfn|Bouwer|2010|p=4}} Belgian literature in the decades following the Congo Crisis portrayed him as incompetent, demagogic, aggressive, ungrateful, undiplomatic, and communist.{{sfn|Blommaert|Verschueren|1991|pp=16–17}} Most Africanists of the 20th century, such as [[Jean-Claude Willame]], viewed Lumumba as an intransigent, unrealistic idealist without any tangible programme who distanced himself from his contemporaries and alienated the Western world with radical anti-colonial rhetoric.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=174}} They saw him as greatly responsible for the political crisis that resulted in his downfall. A handful of other writers, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], shared the belief that Lumumba's goals were unattainable in 1960 but nevertheless viewed him as a martyr of Congolese independence at the hands of certain Western interests and the victim of events over which he had little control. According to sociologist [[Ludo De Witte]], both of these perspectives overstate the political weaknesses and isolation of Lumumba.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=174}}

The conventional narrative of Lumumba's premiership and downfall—that he was an uncompromising radical who provoked his own murder by angering domestic separatists—was severely challenged by De Witte's 2001 work, ''The Assassination of Patrice Lumumba'', which provided evidence that the Belgian government—with the complicity of the United States and the UN—was largely responsible for his death.{{sfn|Hickner|2011|pp=341–342}} Media discussion of Lumumba, spurred by the release of the book as well as a feature film in 2000, ''[[Lumumba (film)|Lumumba]]'', became significantly more positive afterwards. A new narrative subsequently emerged, holding Western espionage at fault for Lumumba's death, and emphasising the threat his charismatic appeal posed to Western interests.{{sfn|Hickner|2011|pp=342–343}} Lumumba's role in the Congolese independence movement is well-documented, and he is typically recognised as its most important and influential leader.{{sfn|Covington-Ward|2012|p=73}}{{efn|Anthropologist Yolanda Covington-Ward wrote that, though Lumumba was &quot;privileged in the historical literature on nationalism in the Congo&quot;, Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO were actually the primary &quot;driving force&quot; behind the independence movement.{{sfn|Covington-Ward|2012|p=73}}}} His exploits are usually celebrated as the work of him as an individual and not that of a larger movement.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=175}}

===Political impact===
Due to his relatively short career in government, quick removal from power, and controversial death, a consensus has not been reached on Lumumba's political legacy. His downfall was detrimental to African nationalist movements, and he is generally remembered primarily for his assassination.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=175}} Numerous American historians have cited his death as a major contributing factor to the radicalisation of the [[American civil rights movement]] in the 1960s,{{sfn|Hickner|2011|p=17}} and many African-American activist organisations and publications used public comment on his death to express their ideology.{{sfn|Dworkin|2017|pp=231–232}} Popular memory of Lumumba has often discarded his politics and reduced him to a symbol.{{sfn|Bouwer|2010|p=6}} The ideological legacy of Lumumba is known as ''Lumumbisme'' (French for Lumumbism). Rather than a complex doctrine, it is usually framed as a set of fundamental principles consisting of [[Congolese nationalism (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|nationalism]], [[Pan-Africanism]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]], and [[social progressivism]].{{sfn|Stack|1964|p=142}} [[Mobutism]] built off of these principles.&lt;ref name= lavdc/&gt; Congolese university students—who had up until independence held little respect for Lumumba—embraced ''Lumumbisme'' after his death.{{sfn|Monaville|2019|p=S22}} According to political scientist [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]], Lumumba's &quot;greatest legacy...for the Congo is the ideal of national unity&quot;. Nzongola-Ntalaja further posited that, as a result of Lumumba's high praise of the independence movement and his work to end the Katangese secession, &quot;the people of the Congo are likely to remain steadfast in their defense of national unity and territorial integrity, come hell or high water.&quot;{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2014|loc=8: The Political Legacy of Patrice Lumumba}}

Following the suppression of the rebellions of 1964 and 1965, most Lumumbist ideology was confined to isolated groups of intellectuals who faced repression under [[History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Zaire (1965–97)|Mobutu's regime]]. Centres of Lumumba's popularity in his lifetime underwent a gradual decline in fidelity to his person and ideas. According to Africanist [[Bogumil Jewsiewicki]], by 1999 &quot;the only faithful surviving Lumumbist nucleus is located in Sankuru and Maniema, and its loyalty is questionable (more ethnical, regional, and sentimental than ideological and political).&quot;{{sfn|Jewsiewicki|1999|p=54}} Lumumba's image was unpopular in southern Kasai for years after his death, as many [[Baluba]] remained aware of the military campaign he ordered in August 1960 that resulted in violent atrocities against their people.{{sfn|Olorunsola|1972|p=260}} At least a dozen Congolese political parties have claimed to bear Lumumba's political and spiritual heritage.{{sfn|Bouwer|2010|p=4}} Despite this, few entities have attempted or succeeded in incorporating his ideas into a comprehensible political program.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=175}} Most of these parties have enjoyed little electoral support, though Gizenga's [[Unified Lumumbist Party|Parti Lumumbiste Unifié]] was represented in the Congolese coalition government formed under President [[Joseph Kabila]] in 2006. Aside from student groups, Lumumbist ideals play only a minor role in current Congolese politics.{{sfn|Monaville|2019|p=S31}}

Lumumba's death began to take on great significance in the [[collective memory]] of the Congolese people in the immediate years after his passing. It is perceived that Lumumba was killed through Western machinations because he defended the Congo's [[self-determination]].{{sfn|De Goede|2015|p=587}} The killing is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West.{{sfn|De Goede|2015|pp=587–588}} Lumumba's determination to pursue his goals is extrapolated upon the Congolese people as their own; securing the Congo's dignity and self-determination would thus ensure their &quot;redemption&quot; from victimisation by Western powers.{{sfn|De Goede|2015|p=589}} Historian David Van Reybrouck wrote, &quot;In no time Lumumba became a martyr of decolonisation...He owed this status more to the horrible end of his life than to his political successes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Sixty years since historic Lumumba speech launched Congo independence| newspaper = The Tribune| agency = Agence France-Presse| date = June 29, 2020| url = https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/sixty-years-since-historic-lumumba-speech-launched-congo-independence-106072| access-date = July 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Michela Wrong]] remarked that &quot;He really did become a hero after his death, in a way that one has to wonder if he would have been such a hero if he had remained and run the country and faced all the problems that running a country as big as Congo would have inevitably brought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dw.com/en/patrice-lumumba-remembering-africas-che-guevara/a-18981406 | title = Patrice Lumumba: Remembering 'Africa's Che Guevara'| last = Müller-Jung| first = Friederike| date = 15 January 2016| publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]]| access-date = 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Pedro Monaville wrote that &quot;his globally iconic status was not commensurate with his more complex legacy in [the] Congo.&quot;{{sfn|Monaville|2019|p=S33}}

His name is also mentioned in [[Rapping|rap]] music; [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Nas]], [[David Banner]], [[Black Thought]], [[Damso]], [[Baloji (rapper)|Baloji]], [[Médine (rapper)|Médine]], [[Sammus]] and many others have mentioned him in their work.{{sfn|Huskens|Goddeeris|2020|pp=298–327}} In popular painting he is often paired with notions of sacrifice and redemption,{{sfn|African Studies Review|2005|p=81}} even being portrayed as a [[Messianism|messiah]], with his downfall being [[Passion of Jesus|his passion]].{{sfn|De Goede|2015|p=588}} Lumumba is relatively absent from Congolese writing, and he is often portrayed with only subtle or ambiguous references.{{sfn|Bouwer|2010|p=5}} Congolese authors [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]]'s and [[Sylvain Bemba]]'s fictional ''Parentheses of Blood'' and ''Léopolis'', respectively, both feature characters with strong similarities to Lumumba.{{sfn|Thomas|1996|pp=155–156}} In written tributes to Mobutu, Lumumba is usually portrayed as an adviser to the former. Writer [[Charles Djungu-Simba]] observed, &quot;Lumumba is rather considered as a vestige of the past, albeit an illustrious past&quot;.{{sfn|Bouwer|2010|p=5}} His surname is often used to identify [[Lumumba (drink)|a long drink]] of hot or cold chocolate and rum.{{sfn|Ehmer|Hindermann|2015|p=32}}

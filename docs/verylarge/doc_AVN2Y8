===Pucciniomycotina===
The [[Pucciniomycotina]] include the rust fungi, the insect parasitic/symbiotic genus ''[[Septobasidium]]'', a former group of smut fungi (in the [[Microbotryomycetes]], which includes mirror yeasts), and a mixture of odd, infrequently seen, or seldom recognized fungi, often parasitic on plants. The eight classes in the Pucciniomycotina are [[Agaricostilbomycetes]], [[Atractiellomycetes]], [[Classiculomycetes]], [[Cryptomycocolacomycetes]], [[Cystobasidiomycetes]], [[Microbotryomycetes]], [[Mixiomycetes]], and [[Pucciniomycetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Cannon|Stalpers|2008|p=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ustilaginomycotina===
The [[Ustilaginomycotina]] are most (but not all) of the former smut fungi and the [[Exobasidiales]]. The classes of the Ustilaginomycotina are the [[Exobasidiomycetes]], the Entorrhizomycetes, and the [[Ustilaginomycetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Cannon|Stalpers|2008|pp=717–718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genera included===
There are several genera classified in the Basidiomycota that are 1) poorly known, 2) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or 3) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., they are ''[[incertae sedis]]'' with respect to familial placement). These include:

==Typical life-cycle==
[[File:Fungi Sexual reproduction cycle.png|thumb|upright=2|Sexual reproduction cycle of basidiomycetes]]
[[File:03 01 07 life cycle Basidiomycota basidium (M. Piepenbring).svg|thumb|Basidiomycota life cycle]]
[[File:Fungus cell cycle-en.svg|thumb|Cell cycle of a Dikaryotic basidiomycete]]
Unlike animals and plants which have readily recognizable male and female counterparts, Basidiomycota (except for the [[rust (fungus)|Rust]] ([[Pucciniales]])) tend to have mutually indistinguishable, compatible [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploids]] which are usually [[mycelia]] being composed of filamentous [[hyphae]]. Typically haploid Basidiomycota mycelia fuse via [[plasmogamy]] and then the compatible nuclei migrate into each other's mycelia and pair up with the resident nuclei. [[Karyogamy]] is delayed, so that the compatible nuclei remain in pairs, called a '''[[dikaryon]]'''. The hyphae are then said to be '''dikaryotic'''. Conversely, the haploid mycelia are called '''[[monokaryon]]s'''. Often, the dikaryotic mycelium is more vigorous than the individual '''monokaryotic''' mycelia, and proceeds to take over the substrate in which they are growing. The dikaryons can be long-lived, lasting years, decades, or centuries. ''The monokaryons are neither male nor female''. They have either a '''bipolar''' ('''unifactorial''') or a '''tetrapolar''' ('''bifactorial''') mating system. This results in the fact that following [[meiosis]], the resulting haploid [[basidiospore]]s and resultant monokaryons, have nuclei that are compatible with 50% (if bipolar) or 25% (if tetrapolar) of their sister basidiospores (and their resultant monokaryons) because the mating genes must differ for them to be compatible. However, there are sometimes more than two possible alleles for a given locus, and in such species, depending on the specifics, over 90% of '''monokaryons''' could be compatible with each other.

The maintenance of the dikaryotic status in dikaryons in many Basidiomycota is facilitated by the formation of [[clamp connection]]s that physically appear to help coordinate and re-establish pairs of compatible nuclei following synchronous [[mitotic]] nuclear divisions. Variations are frequent and multiple. In a typical Basidiomycota lifecycle the long lasting dikaryons periodically (seasonally or occasionally) produce [[basidia]], the specialized usually club-shaped end cells, in which a pair of compatible nuclei fuse ([[karyogamy]]) to form a [[diploid]] cell. [[Meiosis]] follows shortly with the production of 4 haploid nuclei that migrate into 4 external, usually apical [[basidiospore]]s. Variations occur, however. Typically the basidiospores are [[Ballistics|ballistic]], hence they are sometimes also called [[ballistospore]]s. In most species, the basidiospores disperse and each can start a new haploid mycelium, continuing the lifecycle. Basidia are microscopic but they are often produced on or in multicelled large fructifications called [[basidiocarp]]s or basidiomes, or [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruitbodies]]), variously called [[mushroom]]s, [[puffball]]s, etc. Ballistic basidiospores are formed on '''sterigmata''' which are tapered spine-like projections on basidia, and are typically curved, like the horns of a bull. In some Basidiomycota the spores are not ballistic, and the sterigmata may be straight, reduced to stubbs, or absent. The basidiospores of these non-ballistosporic basidia may either bud off, or be released via dissolution or disintegration of the basidia.

[[Image:Basidium schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Scheme of a typical basidiocarp, the dipoid reproductive structure of a basidiomycete, showing fruiting body, [[hymenium]] and basidia.]]

In summary, meiosis takes place in a diploid basidium. Each one of the four haploid nuclei migrates into its own basidiospore. The basidiospores are ballistically discharged and start new haploid mycelia called monokaryons. There are no males or females, rather there are compatible thalli with multiple compatibility factors. Plasmogamy between compatible individuals leads to delayed karyogamy leading to establishment of a dikaryon. The dikaryon is long lasting but ultimately gives rise to either fruitbodies with basidia or directly to basidia without fruitbodies. The paired dikaryon in the basidium fuse (i.e. karyogamy takes place). The diploid basidium begins the cycle again.

===Meiosis===
''[[Coprinopsis cinerea]]'' is a basidiomycete mushroom. It is particularly suited to the study of [[meiosis]] because meiosis progresses synchronously in about 10 million cells within the mushroom cap, and the meiotic prophase stage is prolonged. Burns et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20885784&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burns | first1 = C. | last2 = Stajich | first2 = J.

These similarities in the patterns of expression led to the conclusion that the core expression program of meiosis has been conserved in these fungi for over half a billion years of evolution since these species diverged.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20885784&quot; /&gt;

''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Corn smut|Ustilago maydis]]'' are examples of pathogenic basidiomycota. Such pathogens must be able to overcome the oxidative defenses of their respective hosts in order to produce a successful infection. The ability to undergo meiosis may provide a survival benefit for these fungi by promoting successful infection. A characteristic central feature of meiosis is recombination between homologous chromosomes. This process is associated with repair of DNA damage, particularly [[double-strand break]]s.  The ability of ''C. neoformans'' and ''U. maydis'' to undergo meiosis may contribute to their virulence by repairing the oxidative DNA damage caused by their host's release of [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15846346&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = X. | last2 = Hull | first2 = C.

==Variations in lifecycles==
Many variations occur. Some are self-compatible and spontaneously form dikaryons without a separate compatible thallus being involved. These fungi are said to be homothallic, versus the normal heterothallic species with mating types. Others are secondarily homothallic, in that two compatible nuclei following meiosis migrate into each basidiospore, which is then dispersed as a pre-existing dikaryon. Often such species form only two spores per basidium, but that too varies. Following meiosis, mitotic divisions can occur in the basidium. Multiple numbers of basidiospores can result, including odd numbers via degeneration of nuclei, or pairing up of nuclei, or lack of migration of nuclei. For example, the chanterelle genus ''[[Craterellus]]'' often has six-spored basidia, while some corticioid ''[[Sistotrema]]'' species can have two-, four-, six-, or eight-spored basidia, and the cultivated button mushroom, ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]''. can have one-, two-, three- or four-spored basidia under some circumstances. Occasionally, monokaryons of some taxa can form morphologically fully formed basidiomes and anatomically correct basidia and ballistic basidiospores in the absence of dikaryon formation, diploid nuclei, and meiosis. A rare few number of taxa have extended diploid lifecycles, but can be common species. Examples exist in the mushroom genera ''[[Armillaria]]'' and ''[[Xerula]]'', both in the [[Physalacriaceae]]. Occasionally, basidiospores are not formed and parts of the &quot;basidia&quot; act as the dispersal agents, e.g. the peculiar mycoparasitic jelly fungus, ''[[Tetragoniomyces]]'' or the entire &quot;basidium&quot; acts as a &quot;spore&quot;, e.g. in some false puffballs (''[[Scleroderma (genus)|Scleroderma]]''). In the human pathogenic genus ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'', four nuclei following meiosis remain in the basidium, but continually divide mitotically, each nucleus migrating into synchronously forming nonballistic basidiospores that are then pushed upwards by another set forming below them, resulting in four parallel chains of dry &quot;basidiospores&quot;.

Other variations occur, some as standard lifecycles (that themselves have variations within variations) within specific orders.

===Rusts===
[[rust (fungus)|Rusts]] ([[Pucciniales]], previously known as [[Uredinales]]) at their greatest complexity, produce five different types of spores on two different host plants in two unrelated host families. Such rusts are heteroecious (requiring two hosts) and macrocyclic (producing all five spores types). Wheat [[stem rust]] is an example. By convention, the stages and spore states are numbered by [[Roman numerals]]. Typically, basidiospores infect host one, also known as the alternate or sexual host, and the mycelium forms [[pycnidia]], which are miniature, flask-shaped, hollow, submicroscopic bodies embedded in the host tissue (such as a leaf). This stage, numbered &quot;0&quot;, produces single-celled spores that ooze out in a sweet liquid and that act as nonmotile [[spermatia]], and also protruding [[receptive hyphae]]. [[Insect]]s and probably other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] such as rain carry the spermatia from spermagonium to spermagonium, cross inoculating the mating types. Neither thallus is male or female. Once crossed, the dikaryons are established and a second spore stage is formed, numbered &quot;I&quot; and called [[aecia]], which form dikaryotic [[aeciospore]]s in dry chains in inverted cup-shaped bodies embedded in host tissue. These aeciospores then infect the second host, known as the primary or asexual host (in macrocyclic rusts). On the primary host a repeating spore stage is formed, numbered &quot;II&quot;, the [[urediospore]]s in dry pustules called [[uredinia]]. Urediospores are dikaryotic and can infect the same host that produced them. They repeatedly infect this host over the growing season. At the end of the season, a fourth spore type, the [[teliospore]], is formed. It is thicker-walled and serves to overwinter or to survive other harsh conditions. It does not continue the infection process, rather it remains dormant for a period and then germinates to form [[basidia]] (stage &quot;IV&quot;), sometimes called a [[promycelium]]. In the Pucciniales, the basidia are cylindrical and become 3-[[septum|septate]] after meiosis, with each of the 4 cells bearing one basidiospore each. The basidiospores disperse and start the infection process on host 1 again. [[Autoecious]] rusts complete their life-cycles on one host instead of two, and '''microcyclic''' rusts cut out one or more stages.

===Smuts===
The characteristic part of the life-cycle of [[smut (fungus)|smuts]] is the thick-walled, often darkly pigmented, ornate, teliospore that serves to survive harsh conditions such as overwintering and also serves to help disperse the fungus as dry [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]]. The teliospores are initially dikaryotic but become diploid via karyogamy. Meiosis takes place at the time of germination. A promycelium is formed that consists of a short hypha (equated to a basidium). In some smuts such as ''[[Ustilago maydis]]'' the nuclei migrate into the promycelium that becomes septate (i.e., divided into cellular compartments separated by cell walls called ''[[Septum#In mycology|septa]]''), and haploid yeast-like conidia/basidiospores sometimes called sporidia, bud off laterally from each cell. In various smuts, the yeast phase may proliferate, or they may fuse, or they may infect plant tissue and become hyphal. In other smuts, such as ''[[Tilletia tritici|Tilletia caries]]'', the elongated haploid basidiospores form apically, often in compatible pairs that fuse centrally resulting in &quot;H&quot;-shaped [[diaspore]]s which are by then dikaryotic. Dikaryotic conidia may then form. Eventually the host is infected by infectious hyphae. Teliospores form in host tissue. Many variations on these general themes occur.

Smuts with both a yeast phase and an infectious hyphal state are examples of [[Polymorphism (biology)|dimorphic]] Basidiomycota. In plant parasitic taxa, the saprotrophic phase is normally the yeast while the infectious stage is hyphal. However, there are examples of animal and human parasites where the species are dimorphic but it is the yeast-like state that is infectious. The genus ''[[Filobasidiella]]'' forms basidia on hyphae but the main infectious stage is more commonly known by the [[anamorph]]ic yeast name ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'', e.g. ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]''.

The dimorphic Basidiomycota with yeast stages and the pleiomorphic rusts are examples of fungi with [[anamorph]]s, which are the asexual stages. Some Basidiomycota are only known as anamorphs. Many are yeasts, collectively called basidiomycetous yeasts to differentiate them from ascomycetous yeasts in the [[Ascomycota]]. Aside from yeast anamorphs, and uredinia, aecia and pycnidia, some Basidiomycota form other distinctive anamorphs as parts of their life-cycles. Examples are ''[[Collybia tuberosa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.utk.edu/mycology/ATBI/Photos/12000to12099/12074.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025221100/http://www.bio.utk.edu/mycology/ATBI/Photos/12000to12099/12074.jpg |archivedate=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with its apple-seed-shaped and coloured [[sclerotium]], ''[[Dendrocollybia racemosa]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnwfungi.org/pdf%20files/manuscripts%20volume%201/pnwf20069.pdf Microsoft Word – Machnicki revised for pdf final august 24&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203256/http://www.pnwfungi.org/pdf%20files/manuscripts%20volume%201/pnwf20069.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; with its sclerotium and its ''[[Tilachlidiopsis racemosa]]'' conidia, ''[[Armillaria]]'' with their [[mycelial cord|rhizomorphs]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.bioart.co.uk/lux/mycit.html LUXGENE.COM: the glow-in-the-dark website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hohenbuehelia]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gbarron/ZBiodiversity/hohenbue.htm |title=Hohenbue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221075703/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gbarron/ZBiodiversity/hohenbue.htm |archive-date=2006-12-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their ''[[Nematoctonus]]'' [[nematode]] infectious, state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gbarron/ZBiodiversity/8knobs.htm |title=8knobs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221075333/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gbarron/ZBiodiversity/8knobs.htm |archive-date=2006-12-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coffee leaf parasite, ''[[Mycena citricolor]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; and its ''[[Decapitatus flavidus]]'' [[propagule]]s called gemmae.

'''Ascomycota''' is a [[phylum]] of the kingdom [[Fungi]] that, together with the [[Basidiomycota]], forms the subkingdom [[Dikarya]]. Its members are commonly known as the '''sac fungi''' or '''ascomycetes'''. It is the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk ''et al''., p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining feature of this fungal group is the &quot;[[ascus]]&quot; (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀσκός}} (''askos''), meaning &quot;sac&quot; or &quot;wineskin&quot;), a microscopic [[Sexual reproduction|sexual structure]] in which nonmotile [[spore]]s, called [[ascospore]]s, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|asexual]], meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores.  Familiar examples of sac fungi include [[Morchella|morel]]s, [[truffle]]s, [[yeast#Beer|brewer's yeast]] and [[baker's yeast]], [[Xylaria|dead man's fingers]], and [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]]. The fungal [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in the majority of [[lichen]]s (loosely termed &quot;ascolichens&quot;) such as ''[[Cladonia]]'' belong to the Ascomycota.

Ascomycota is a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group (it contains all descendants of one common ancestor). Previously placed in the [[Deuteromycota]] along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiological]] similarities to ascus-bearing [[Taxon|taxa]], and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences.&lt;ref name=Lutzoni_2004&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lutzoni F|title= Assembling the fungal tree of life: progress, classification, and evolution of subcellular traits|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2004|pages=1446–80|volume=91|doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1446|issue=10|pmid=21652303|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=James_2006&gt;{{cite journal|author=James TY|s2cid=4302864|title=Reconstructing the early evolution of Fungi using a six-gene phylogeny|journal=Nature|year=2006|pages=818–22|volume=443|pmid=17051209|doi=10.1038/nature05110|issue=7113|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2006Natur.443..818J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ascomycetes are of particular use to humans as sources of medicinally important compounds, such as [[antibacterial|antibiotics]], for [[fermentation|fermenting]] bread, alcoholic beverages and cheese. ''[[Penicillium]]'' species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial [[infectious disease]]s are examples of ascomycetes.

Many ascomycetes are [[pathogen]]s, both of animals, including humans, and of plants. Examples of ascomycetes that can cause infections in humans include ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and several tens of species that cause [[Dermatophytosis|skin infections]]. The many [[plant pathology|plant-pathogenic]] ascomycetes include [[apple scab]], [[Magnaporthe grisea|rice blast]], the [[Ergot|ergot fungi]], [[Dibotryon morbosum|black knot]], and the [[powdery mildew]]s.
Several species of ascomycetes are biological [[model organism]]s in laboratory research. Most famously, ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', several species of [[yeast]]s, and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species are used in many [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]] studies.

== Asexual reproduction in ascomycetes ==

Ascomycetes are 'spore shooters'. They are fungi which produce microscopic spores inside special, elongated cells or sacs, known as 'asci', which give the group its name.

Asexual reproduction is the dominant form of propagation in the Ascomycota, and is responsible for the rapid spread of these fungi into new areas. Asexual reproduction of ascomycetes is very diverse from both structural and functional points of view. The most important and general is production of conidia, but chlamydospores are also frequently produced. Furthermore, Ascomycota also reproduce asexually through budding.

'''Conidia formation:'''

Asexual reproduction may occur through vegetative reproductive spores, the conidia. The asexual, non-motile haploid spores of a fungus, which are named after the Greek word for dust (conia), are hence also known as conidiospores and mitospores. The '''[[conidiospores]]''' commonly contain one nucleus and are products of mitotic cell divisions and thus are sometimes call '''mitospores''', which are genetically identical to the mycelium from which they originate. They are typically formed at the ends of specialized hyphae, the conidiophores. Depending on the species they may be dispersed by wind or water, or by animals. Conidiophores may simply branch off from the mycelia or they may be formed in fruiting bodies.
[[File:Conidia Formation.png|thumb|424x424px]]
The hypha that creates the sporing (conidiating) tip can be very similar to the normal hyphal tip, or it can be differentiated. The most common differentiation is the formation of a bottle shaped cell called a '''[[phialide]],''' from which the spores are produced. Not all of these asexual structures are a single hypha. In some groups, the conidiophores (the structures that bear the conidia) are aggregated to form a thick structure.

E.g. In the order ''Moniliales,'' all of them are single hyphae with the exception of the aggregations, termed as coremia or synnema. These produce structures rather like corn-stokes, with many conidia being produced in a mass from the aggregated conidiophores.

The diverse conidia and conidiophores sometimes develop in asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. acervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium). Some species of ''Ascomycetes'' form their structures within plant tissue, either as parasite or saprophytes. These fungi have evolved more complex asexual sporing structures, probably influenced by the cultural conditions of plant tissue as a substrate. These structures are called the '''sporodochium'''. This is a cushion of conidiophores created from a pseudoparenchymatous [[stroma (mycology)|stroma]] in plant tissue. The '''[[pycnidium]]''' is a globose to flask-shaped parenchymatous structure, lined on its inner wall with conidiophores. The '''[[acervulus]]''' is a flat saucer shaped bed of conidiophores produced under a plant cuticle, which eventually erupt through the cuticle for dispersal.
[[File:Conidia Formation Image.png|thumb|333x333px]]
'''Budding:'''

Asexual reproduction process in ascomycetes also involves the budding which we clearly observe in '''yeast'''. This is termed a &quot;blastic process&quot;. It involves the blowing out or blebbing of the hyphal tip wall. The blastic process can involve all wall layers, or there can be a new cell wall synthesized which is extruded from within the old wall.
[[File:Budding.png|centre|thumb|337x337px]]
The initial events of budding can be seen as the development of a ring of chitin around the point where the bud is about to appear. This reinforces and stabilizes the cell wall. Enzymatic activity and turgor pressure act to weaken and extrude the cell wall. New cell wall material is incorporated during this phase. Cell contents are forced into the progeny cell, and as the final phase of mitosis ends a cell plate, the point at which a new cell wall will grow inwards from, forms.

==Characteristics of ascomycetes==

* Ascomycota are morphologically diverse. The group includes organisms from unicellular yeasts to complex cup fungi.
* 98% of [[lichens]] have an Ascomycota as the fungal part of the lichen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCoy | first = Peter | title = Radical Mycology | year = 2016 | publisher = Chthaeus Press | language = en | url = https://archive.org/details/radicalmicologytexts | isbn =9780986399602 }} &lt;/ref&gt;
* There are 2000 identified genera and 30,000 species of Ascomycota.
* The unifying characteristic among these diverse groups is the presence of a reproductive structure known as the '''ascus''', though in some cases it has a reduced role in the life cycle.
* Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, plus truffles and morels, which are held as gourmet delicacies.
* Many of them cause tree diseases, such as Dutch elm disease and apple blights.
* Some of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes are apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews.
* The yeasts are used to produce alcoholic beverages and breads. The mold ''Penicillium'' is used to produce the antibiotic penicillin.
* Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form '''symbiotic''' associations with algae to form lichens.
* Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungi), form important '''mycorrhizal''' relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects.
* Almost all ascomycetes are terrestrial or parasitic.  However, a few have adapted to marine or freshwater environments.
* The cell walls of the hyphae are variably composed of '''chitin''' and β-glucans, just as in Basidiomycota.  However, these fibers are set in a matrix of glycoprotein containing the sugars galactose and mannose.
* The mycelium of ascomycetes is usually made up of '''septate hyphae'''.  However, there is not necessarily any fixed number of nuclei in each of the divisions.
* The septal walls have septal pores which provide cytoplasmic continuity throughout the individual hyphae.  Under appropriate conditions, nuclei may also migrate between septal compartments through the septal pores.
* A unique character of the Ascomycota (but not present in all ascomycetes) is the presence of '''Woronin bodies''' on each side of the septa separating the hyphal segments which control the septal pores.  If an adjoining hypha is ruptured, the Woronin bodies block the pores to prevent loss of cytoplasm into the ruptured compartment.  The Woronin bodies are spherical, hexagonal, or rectangular membrane bound structures with a crystalline protein matrix.

== Modern classification ==
There are three [[subphylum|subphyla]] that are described and accepted:
* The ''[[Pezizomycotina]]'' are the largest subphylum and contains all ascomycetes that produce [[ascocarp]]s (fruiting bodies), except for one genus, ''[[Neolecta]]'', in the [[Taphrinomycotina]]. It is roughly equivalent to the previous taxon, ''Euascomycetes''. The Pezizomycotina includes most macroscopic &quot;ascos&quot; such as [[truffle]]s, [[ergot]], ascolichens, [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]] ([[discomycetes]]), [[Sordariomycetes|pyrenomycetes]], [[Gyromitra esculenta|lorchels]], and [[Ophiocordyceps sinensis|caterpillar fungus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312153703/http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|title=Caterpillar Fungus|archive-date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains microscopic fungi such as [[powdery mildew]]s, [[Trichophyton|dermatophytic]] fungi, and [[Laboulbeniales]].
* The ''[[Saccharomycotina]]'' comprise most of the &quot;true&quot; yeasts, such as [[baker's yeast]] and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', which are single-celled (unicellular) fungi, which reproduce vegetatively by budding. Most of these species were previously classified in a taxon called ''Hemiascomycetes''.
* The ''[[Taphrinomycotina]]'' include a disparate and [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] group within the Ascomycota that was recognized following molecular ([[DNA]]) analyses. The taxon was originally named ''[[Archiascomycetes]]'' (or ''[[Archaeascomycetes]]''). It includes hyphal fungi (''[[Neolecta]]'', ''[[Taphrina]]'', ''[[Archaeorhizomyces]]''), fission yeasts (''[[Schizosaccharomyces]]''), and the mammalian lung parasite ''[[Pneumocystis]]''.

== Outdated taxon names ==
Several outdated taxon names—based on morphological features—are still occasionally used for species of the Ascomycota. These include the following sexual ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]ic) groups, defined by the structures of their sexual [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]]: the [[Discomycetes]], which included all species forming [[ascocarp|apothecia]]; the [[Pyrenomycetes]], which included all sac fungi that formed [[ascocarp|perithecia]] or [[ascocarp|pseudothecia]], or any structure resembling these morphological structures; and the Plectomycetes, which included those species that form [[ascocarp|cleistothecia]]. [[Hemiascomycetes]] included the yeasts and yeast-like fungi that have now been placed into the [[Saccharomycotina]] or [[Taphrinomycotina]], while the [[Euascomycetes]] included the remaining species of the Ascomycota, which are now in the [[Pezizomycotina]], and the [[Neolecta]], which are in the Taphrinomycotina.

Some ascomycetes do not reproduce sexually or are not known to produce [[ascus|asci]] and are therefore [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic species. Those anamorphs that produce [[Conidium|conidia]] (mitospores) were previously described as [[mitosporic Ascomycota]]. Some taxonomists placed this group into a separate [[form classification|artificial phylum]], the [[Deuteromycota]] (or &quot;Fungi Imperfecti&quot;). Where recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analyses]] have identified close relationships with ascus-bearing taxa, anamorphic species have been grouped into the Ascomycota, despite the absence of the defining ascus. Sexual and asexual isolates of the same species commonly carry different [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] species names, as, for example, ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and ''Emericella nidulans'', for asexual and sexual isolates, respectively, of the same species.

Species of the Deuteromycota were classified as Coelomycetes if they produced their conidia in minute flask- or saucer-shaped conidiomata, known technically as ''pycnidia'' and ''acervuli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hyphomycetes]] were those species where the [[conidiophore]]s (''i.e.'', the hyphal structures that carry conidia-forming cells at the end) are free or loosely organized. They are mostly isolated but sometimes also appear as bundles of cells aligned in parallel (described as ''synnematal'') or as cushion-shaped masses (described as ''sporodochial'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|pp=218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==
[[File:Ophiocordyceps caloceroides.jpg|thumb|right| A member of the genus ''[[Cordyceps]]'' which is parasitic on arthropods. Note the elongated stromata. Species unknown, perhaps ''Cordyceps ignota''.]]
[[File:04 01 02 life cycle Ascomycota, ascus (M. Piepenbring).svg|thumb|Ascomycete life cycle]]
Most species grow as filamentous, microscopic structures called [[hypha]]e or as budding single cells (yeasts). Many [[Anastomosis|interconnected]] hyphae form a [[thallus]] usually referred to as the [[mycelium]], which—when visible to the naked eye (macroscopic)—is commonly called [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]. During sexual reproduction, many Ascomycota typically produce large numbers of [[ascus|asci]]. The ascus is often contained in a multicellular, occasionally readily visible fruiting structure, the [[ascocarp]] (also called an ''ascoma''). Ascocarps come in a very large variety of shapes: cup-shaped, club-shaped, potato-like, spongy, seed-like, oozing and pimple-like, coral-like, nit-like, golf-ball-shaped, perforated tennis ball-like, cushion-shaped, plated and feathered in miniature ([[Laboulbeniales]]), microscopic classic Greek shield-shaped, stalked or sessile. They can appear solitary or clustered. Their texture can likewise be very variable, including fleshy, like charcoal (carbonaceous), leathery, rubbery, gelatinous, slimy, powdery, or cob-web-like. Ascocarps come in multiple colors such as red, orange, yellow, brown, black, or, more rarely, green or blue. Some ascomyceous fungi, such as ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', grow as single-celled yeasts, which—during sexual reproduction—develop into an ascus, and do not form fruiting bodies.
[[File:Xylaria hypoxylon.jpg|thumb|left|The &quot;candlesnuff fungus&quot; in its asexual state, ''[[Xylaria hypoxylon]]'']]

In [[lichen]]ized species, the thallus of the fungus defines the shape of the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] colony. Some [[Phenotypic switching|dimorphic]] species, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', can switch between growth as single cells and as filamentous, multicellular hyphae. Other species are [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]], exhibiting asexual (anamorphic) as well as a sexual (teleomorphic) growth forms.

Except for lichens, the non-reproductive (vegetative) mycelium of most ascomycetes is usually inconspicuous because it is commonly embedded in the substrate, such as soil, or grows on or inside a living host, and only the ascoma may be seen when fruiting. [[Pigment]]ation, such as [[melanin]] in hyphal walls, along with prolific growth on surfaces can result in visible mold colonies; examples include ''[[Cladosporium]]'' species, which form black spots on bathroom caulking and other moist areas. Many ascomycetes cause food spoilage, and, therefore, the pellicles or moldy layers that develop on jams, juices, and other foods are the mycelia of these species or occasionally [[Mucoromycotina]] and almost never [[Basidiomycota]]. [[Sooty mold]]s that develop on plants, especially in the tropics are the thalli of many species.{{Clarify|many ascomycetous species?|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Smardz-Morchella-Ejdzej-2006.jpg|thumb|right|179px|The ascocarp of a [[Morchella|morel]] contains numerous apothecia.]]

Large masses of yeast cells, asci or ascus-like cells, or conidia can also form macroscopic structures. For example. ''[[Pneumocystis]]'' species can colonize lung cavities (visible in x-rays), causing a form of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Krajicek BJ, Thomas CF Jr, Limper AH |year=2009 |title=''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment |journal=Clinics in Chest Medicine |volume=30|issue=2|pages=265–89|pmid=19375633 |doi= 10.1016/j.ccm.2009.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asci of ''[[Ascosphaera]]'' fill [[honey bee]] [[larva]]e and [[pupa]]e causing mummification with a chalk-like appearance, hence the name &quot;chalkbrood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= James RR, Skinner JS |year=2005|title=PCR diagnostic methods for Ascosphaera infections in bees |journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology|volume=90|issue=2|pages=98–103|pmid=16214164 |doi= 10.1016/j.jip.2005.08.004 |url=https://naldc-legacy.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=6101&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeasts for small colonies [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]], and excessive growth of ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' species in the mouth or vagina causes &quot;thrush&quot;, a form of [[candidiasis]].

The cell walls of the ascomycetes almost always contain [[chitin]] and [[Beta-glucan|β-glucans]], and divisions within the hyphae, called &quot;[[septum#In mycology|septa]]&quot;, are the internal boundaries of individual cells (or compartments). The cell wall and septa give stability and rigidity to the hyphae and may prevent loss of [[cytoplasm]] in case of local damage to cell wall and [[cell membrane]]. The septa commonly have a small opening in the center, which functions as a [[cytoplasm]]ic connection between adjacent cells, also sometimes allowing cell-to-cell movement of [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] within a hypha. Vegetative hyphae of most ascomycetes contain only one nucleus per cell (''[[uninucleate]]'' hyphae), but [[multinucleate]] cells—especially in the apical regions of growing hyphae—can also be present.

== Metabolism ==
In common with other fungal phyla, the Ascomycota are [[Heterotrophy|heterotrophic]] organisms that require [[organic compound]]s as energy sources. These are obtained by feeding on a variety of organic substrates including dead matter, foodstuffs, or as [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in or on other living organisms. To obtain these nutrients from their surroundings, ascomycetous fungi secrete powerful [[digestive enzyme]]s that break down organic substances into smaller molecules, which are then taken up into the cell. Many species live on dead plant material such as leaves, twigs, or logs. Several species colonize plants, animals, or other fungi as [[parasite]]s or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic symbionts]] and derive all their metabolic energy in form of nutrients from the tissues of their hosts.

Owing to their long evolutionary history, the Ascomycota have evolved the capacity to break down almost every organic substance. Unlike most organisms, they are able to use their own [[enzyme]]s to digest plant [[biopolymer]]s such as [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]]. [[Collagen]], an abundant structural protein in animals, and [[keratin]]—a protein that forms hair and nails—, can also serve as food sources. Unusual examples include ''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]'', which feeds on wall paint, and the kerosene fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'', which feeds on aircraft fuel (causing occasional problems for the airline industry), and may sometimes block fuel pipes.&lt;ref name=Hendey&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N. I. | year = 1964 | title = Some observations on Cladosporium resinae as a fuel contaminant and its possible role in the corrosion of aluminium alloy fuel tanks | journal = Transactions of the British Mycological Society | volume = 47 | issue = 7| pages = 467–475 | doi=10.1016/s0007-1536(64)80024-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species can resist high [[osmotic pressure|osmotic stress]] and grow, for example, on salted fish, and a few ascomycetes are aquatic.

The Ascomycota is characterized by a high degree of specialization; for instance, certain species of [[Laboulbeniales]] attack only one particular leg of one particular insect species. Many Ascomycota engage in symbiotic relationships such as in lichens—symbiotic associations with green [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]]—in which the fungal symbiont directly obtains products of [[photosynthesis]]. In common with many basidiomycetes and [[Glomeromycota]], some ascomycetes form symbioses with plants by colonizing the roots to form [[mycorrhiza]]l associations. The Ascomycota also represents several [[carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]], which have developed hyphal traps to capture small [[protist]]s such as [[amoeba]]e, as well as [[roundworm]]s (''Nematoda''), [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrade]]s, and small arthropods such as [[springtail]]s (''Collembola'').

== Distribution and living environment ==
The Ascomycota are represented in all land ecosystems worldwide, occurring on all continents including [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Laybourn-Parry J.|year=2009 |title=Microbiology. No place too cold |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5934 |pages=1521–22 |pmid=19541982 |doi= 10.1126/science.1173645 |first1= J|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1521L |s2cid=33598792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spores and hyphal fragments are [[Fungus#Spore dispersal|dispersed]] through the atmosphere and freshwater environments, as well as ocean beaches and tidal zones. The distribution of species is variable; while some are found on all continents, others, as for example the white [[truffle]] ''Tuber magnatum'', only occur in isolated locations in Italy and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mello A, Murat, Bonfante P |year=2006 |title=Truffles: much more than a prized and local fungal delicacy |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=260|issue=1|pages=1–8|pmid=16790011|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2006.00252.x |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of plant-parasitic species is often restricted by host distributions; for example, ''[[Cyttaria]]'' is only found on ''[[Nothofagus]]'' (Southern Beech) in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

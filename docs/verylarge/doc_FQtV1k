[[File:Calcite.png|thumb|right|Crystal structure of calcite]]

'''Calcium carbonate''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[Chemical formula|formula]] [[Calcium|Ca]][[Carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is a common substance found in [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] as the [[mineral]]s [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] (most notably as [[limestone]], which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of [[pearl]]s and the [[Seashell|shells of marine organisms]], [[snail]]s, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in [[agricultural lime]] and is created when calcium ions in [[hard water]] react with [[carbonate ion]]s to create [[limescale]]. It is medicinally used as a [[calcium]] supplement or as an [[antacid]], but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause poor digestion.

==Chemistry==
Calcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates. Notably it
* reacts with [[acid]]s, releasing [[carbon dioxide]] (technically speaking, [[carbonic acid]], but that disintegrates quickly to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O):
::CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|s|solid}}) + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O({{abbr|l|liquid}})
* releases carbon dioxide upon heating, called a [[thermal decomposition]] reaction, or [[calcination]] (to above 840&amp;nbsp;°C in the case of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), to form [[calcium oxide]], commonly called [[quicklime]], with reaction [[enthalpy]] 178&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol:
::CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|s|solid}}) → CaO({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|g|gas}})

Calcium carbonate will react with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble [[calcium bicarbonate]].
:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O({{abbr|l|liquid}}) → Ca(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}})

This reaction is important in the [[erosion]] of [[carbonate rock]], forming [[cavern]]s, and leads to [[hard water]] in many regions.

An unusual form of calcium carbonate is the hexahydrate, [[ikaite]], CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Ikaite is stable only below 8&amp;nbsp;°C.

==Preparation==
The vast majority of calcium carbonate used in industry is extracted by mining or quarrying. Pure calcium carbonate (such as for food or pharmaceutical use), can be produced from a pure quarried source (usually [[marble]]).

Alternatively, calcium carbonate is prepared from [[calcium oxide]]. Water is added to give [[calcium hydroxide]] then [[carbon dioxide]] is passed through this solution to precipitate the desired calcium carbonate, referred to in the industry as precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC):&lt;ref name=&quot;PCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Precipitated Calcium Carbonate|accessdate = 11 January 2014|url = http://www.lime.org/uses_of_lime/other_uses/precip_cc.asp|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140111165543/http://www.lime.org/uses_of_lime/other_uses/precip_cc.asp|archive-date = 11 January 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Structure==
The thermodynamically stable form of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under normal conditions is [[Hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal]] β-CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (the mineral [[calcite]]).&lt;ref name =&quot;Ropp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=R.

==Occurrence==
[[File:Silfurberg.jpg|thumb|[[Calcite]] is the most stable [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of calcium carbonate. It is transparent to opaque. A transparent variety called [[Iceland spar]] (shown here) was used to create [[polarized light]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell2008&quot;&gt;Russell, Daniel E . 17 February 2008.

===Extraterrestrial===
Beyond Earth, strong evidence suggests the presence of calcium carbonate on [[Mars]]. Signs of calcium carbonate have been detected at more than one location (notably at [[Gusev crater|Gusev]] and [[Huygens (crater)|Huygens]] craters). This provides some evidence for the past presence of liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Geology==
[[File:Rubaksa tufa plug.jpg|thumb|left|Surface precipitation of CaCO3 as [[tufa]] in [[Rubaksa]], Ethiopia]]
Carbonate is found frequently in geologic settings and constitutes an enormous [[carbon cycle|carbon reservoir]]. Calcium carbonate occurs as [[aragonite]], [[calcite]] and [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] as significant constituents of the [[calcium cycle]]. The [[carbonate mineral]]s form the rock types: [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], [[tufa]], and others.

In warm, clear tropical waters [[coral]]s are more abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including [[plankton]] (such as [[coccolith]]s and planktic [[foraminifera]]), [[coralline algae]], [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[bryozoa]] and [[Mollusc shell|mollusks]], are typically found in shallow water environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The [[calcification]] processes are changed by [[ocean acidification]].

Where the [[oceanic crust]] is [[Subduction|subducted]] under a [[continental plate]] sediments will be carried down to warmer zones in the [[asthenosphere]] and [[lithosphere]]. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce [[carbon dioxide]] which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]].

===Carbonate compensation depth===
The [[carbonate compensation depth]] (CCD) is the point in the ocean where the rate of precipitation of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;weyl1959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weyl |first1=P.K. |title=The change in solubility of calcium carbonate with temperature and carbon dioxide content |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=1959 |volume=17 |issue=3–4 |pages=214–225 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(59)90096-1|bibcode=1959GeCoA..17..214W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate. The carbonate compensation depth can range from 4,000 to 6,000 meters below sea level.

===Role in taphonomy===
Calcium carbonate can [[taphonomy|preserve fossils]] through [[permineralization]]. Most of the vertebrate fossils of the [[Two Medicine Formation]]—a [[geologic formation]] known for its [[duck-billed dinosaur]] eggs—are preserved by CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; permineralization.&lt;ref name=&quot;twoturn&quot; /&gt; This type of preservation conserves high levels of detail, even down to the microscopic level. However, it also leaves specimens vulnerable to [[weathering]] when exposed to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;twoturn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Trexler |first=D. |date=2001 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgc6CS4EUPsC&amp;pg=PA98 |chapter=Two Medicine Formation, Montana: geology and fauna |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mesozoicvertebra0000unse/page/298 298–309] |title=Mesozoic Vertebrate Life |editor1-last=Tanke |editor1-first=D.

[[Trilobite]] populations were once thought to have composed the majority of aquatic life during the [[Cambrian]], due to the fact that their calcium carbonate-rich shells were more easily preserved than those of other species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11630/out-of-thin-air-dinosaurs-birds-and-earths-ancient-atmosphere|title=Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere|last=Ward|first=Peter|year=2006|isbn=9780309666121|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.17226/11630}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had purely [[chitin]]ous shells.

==Uses==

===Industrial applications===

The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry, either as a building material, or limestone [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] for road building, as an ingredient of [[cement]], or as the starting material for the preparation of [[slaked lime|builders' lime]] by burning in a [[kiln]]. However, because of weathering mainly caused by [[acid rain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Effects of Acid Rain|publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = 14 March 2015|url = http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/materials.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; calcium carbonate (in limestone form) is no longer used for building purposes on its own, but only as a raw primary substance for building materials.

Calcium carbonate is also used in the purification of [[iron]] from [[iron ore]] in a [[blast furnace]]. The carbonate is [[Calcination|calcined]] ''in situ'' to give [[calcium oxide]], which forms a [[slag]] with various impurities present, and separates from the purified iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Blast Furnace|publisher = Science Aid|accessdate = 30 December 2007|url = http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/chemistry/industrial/blastfurnace.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143213/http://www.scienceaid.co.uk/chemistry/industrial/blastfurnace.html|archive-date = 17 December 2007|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[oil industry]], calcium carbonate is added to [[drilling fluid]]s as a formation-bridging and filtercake-sealing agent; it is also a weighting material which increases the density of drilling fluids to control the downhole pressure. Calcium carbonate is added to [[swimming pool]]s, as a [[pH]] corrector for maintaining [[alkalinity]] and offsetting the acidic properties of the [[disinfectant]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jF-AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Calcium+carbonate+is+also+mixed+with+putty+in+setting+stained+glass+windows,+and+as+a+resist+to+prevent+glass+from+sticking+to+kiln+shelves+when+firing+glazes+and+paints+at+high+temperature&amp;pg=PT1601|title=Health &amp; Drugs: Disease, Prescription &amp; Medication|last=Sfetcu|first=Nicolae|date=2014-05-02|publisher=Nicolae Sfetcu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used as a raw material in the [[Sugar refining|refining of sugar]] from [[sugar beet]]; it is calcined in a kiln with [[anthracite]] to produce calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This burnt lime is then slaked in fresh water to produce a calcium hydroxide [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for the precipitation of impurities in raw juice during [[carbonatation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGinnis|first1=R.

Calcium carbonate in the form of [[chalk]] has traditionally been a major component of [[blackboard]] chalk. However, modern manufactured chalk is mostly [[gypsum]], hydrated [[calcium sulfate]] CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Calcium carbonate is a main source for growing [[Seacrete]]. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), pre-dispersed in [[slurry]] form, is a common filler material for [[latex gloves]] with the aim of achieving maximum saving in material and production costs.&lt;ref name=precaco3&gt;{{cite web|title=Precipitated Calcium Carbonate uses |url=http://www.aristocratholding.com/calris-5.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725032803/http://www.aristocratholding.com/calris-5.html |archivedate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is an essential ingredient in the microporous film used in [[diapers]] and some building films, as the pores are nucleated around the calcium carbonate particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC and PCC are used as a filler in [[paper]] because they are cheaper than [[wood fiber]]. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/fillers/ |title=Market Study Fillers, 2nd ed. |publisher=Ceresana |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] in the production of [[glossy paper]]. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline [[papermaking]] or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Calcium carbonate is widely used as an [[Extender (ink)|extender]] in [[paint]]s,&lt;ref name = reade&gt;{{cite web|title = Calcium Carbonate Powder|publisher = Reade Advanced Materials|date = 4 February 2006|accessdate = 30 December 2007|url = http://www.reade.com/Products/Minerals_and_Ores/calcium_carbonate.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080222003757/http://www.reade.com/Products/Minerals_and_Ores/calcium_carbonate.html|archive-date = 22 February 2008|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular [[Gloss and matte paint|matte]] [[emulsion paint]] where typically 30% by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble. It is also a popular filler in plastics.&lt;ref name = reade/&gt; Some typical examples include around 15 to 20% loading of chalk in [[Polyvinyl chloride|unplasticized polyvinyl chloride]] (uPVC) [[Rain gutter|drainpipes]], 5% to 15% loading of [[stearic acid|stearate]]-coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile. [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70&amp;nbsp;phr (parts per hundred parts of resin) to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) and electrical properties (volume resistivity).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Polypropylene]] compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity, a requirement that becomes important at high usage temperatures.&lt;ref name= Imerys&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imerys-perfmins.com/calcium-carbonate/eu/calcium-carbonate-plastic.htm |title=Calcium carbonate in plastic applications |accessdate=1 August 2008 |publisher=Imerys Performance Minerals |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804020529/http://www.imerys-perfmins.com/calcium-carbonate/eu/calcium-carbonate-plastic.htm |archive-date=4 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the percentage is often 20–40%.

Calcium carbonate is added to a wide range of trade and [[do it yourself]] adhesives, sealants, and decorating fillers.&lt;ref name = reade/&gt; Ceramic tile adhesives typically contain 70% to 80% limestone. Decorating crack fillers contain similar levels of marble or dolomite. It is also mixed with putty in setting [[stained glass]] windows, and as a resist to prevent glass from sticking to kiln shelves when firing glazes and paints at high temperature.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[ceramic glaze]] applications, calcium carbonate is known as ''whiting'',&lt;ref name = reade/&gt; and is a common ingredient for many glazes in its white powdered form. When a glaze containing this material is fired in a kiln, the whiting acts as a [[Ceramic flux|flux]] material in the glaze. Ground calcium carbonate is an [[abrasive]] (both as scouring powder and as an ingredient of household scouring creams), in particular in its calcite form, which has the relatively low hardness level of 3 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]], and will therefore not scratch [[glass]] and most other [[ceramic]]s, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[bronze]], [[iron]], and [[steel]], and have a moderate effect on softer metals like [[aluminium]] and [[copper]]. A paste made from calcium carbonate and [[deionized water]] can be used to clean [[tarnish]] on [[silver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Make it Shine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ohio Historical Society Blog: Make It Shine|publisher = Ohio Historical Society|url = http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/making-it-shine/|access-date = 2 June 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120323201653/http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/making-it-shine/|archive-date = 23 March 2012|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and dietary applications===
[[File:500 mg calcium supplements with vitamin D.jpg|thumb|500-milligram calcium supplements made from calcium carbonate]]

It may be used as a [[phosphate binder]] for the treatment of [[hyperphosphatemia]] (primarily in patients with [[chronic kidney failure]]).

Calcium carbonate is used in the production of calcium oxide as well as toothpaste and has seen a resurgence as a food preservative and color retainer, when used in or with products such as organic apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodcookingchemistry/a/cadditives.htm |title=Food Additives – Names Starting with C |website=Chemistry.about.com |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016112555/http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodcookingchemistry/a/cadditives.htm |archive-date=16 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium carbonate is used therapeutically as phosphate binder in patients on maintenance [[haemodialysis]]. It is the most common form of phosphate binder prescribed, particularly in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. Calcium carbonate is the most commonly used phosphate binder, but clinicians are increasingly prescribing the more expensive, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, particularly [[sevelamer]].

Excess calcium from supplements, fortified food, and high-calcium diets can cause [[milk-alkali syndrome]], which has serious toxicity and can be fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the &quot;Sippy regimen&quot; of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in [[kidney failure]], [[alkalosis]], and [[hypercalcaemia]], mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk-alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for [[peptic ulcer]] disease arose. Since the 1990s it has been most frequently reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1.2 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;grams daily, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17483976&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Caruso JB, Patel RM, Julka K, Parish DC |title=Health-behavior induced disease: return of the milk-alkali syndrome |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1053–5 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17483976 |doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0226-0 |pmc=2219730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16702792&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beall DP, Henslee HB, Webb HR, Scofield RH |title=Milk-alkali syndrome: a historical review and description of the modern version of the syndrome |journal=Am.

Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products, which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake. Excessive calcium intake can lead to [[hypercalcemia]], complications of which include vomiting, abdominal pain and altered mental status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clinical problem-solving, back to basics|last1=Gabriely|first1=Ilan|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2008|volume=358|pmid=18450607|doi=10.1056/NEJMcps0706188|issue=18|last2=Leu|first2=James P.|last3=Barzel|first3=Uriel S.|pages=1952–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household use===
Calcium carbonate is a key ingredient in many household cleaning powders like [[Comet (cleanser)|Comet]] and is used as a scrubbing agent.

===Environmental applications===

In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, introduced CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into the Whetstone Brook in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency = [[Associated Press]]|title = Limestone Dispenser Fights Acid Rain in Stream |date=13 June 1989|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/13/science/limestone-dispenser-fights-acid-rain-in-stream.html|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hope was that the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did increase the amount of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in [[river]] ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water.&lt;ref name=env&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Uses for Calcium Carbonate|url=http://www.congcal.com/markets/environmental/|publisher=Congcal|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Schreiber |first=R.

Calcium carbonate is also used in [[flue gas desulfurisation]] applications eliminating harmful SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal and other fossil fuels burnt in large fossil fuel power stations.&lt;ref name=env/&gt;

==Calcination equilibrium==
[[Calcination]] of [[limestone]] using [[charcoal]] fires to produce [[calcium oxide|quicklime]] has been practiced since antiquity by cultures all over the world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825&amp;nbsp;°C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and [[carbon dioxide]] at any temperature. At each temperature there is a [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure in air, which is about 0.035&amp;nbsp;kPa.

At temperatures above 550&amp;nbsp;°C the equilibrium CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure begins to exceed the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure in air. So above 550&amp;nbsp;°C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be much higher than it is in air. Indeed, if all the [[oxygen]] in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the kiln can be as high as 20&amp;nbsp;kPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;solvaypcc2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Solvay Precipitated Calcium Carbonate: Production|publisher = Solvay |date=9 March 2007|accessdate = 30 December 2007|url = http://www.solvaypcc.com/safety_environment/0,0,1000044-_EN,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table shows that this partial pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800&amp;nbsp;°C. For the outgassing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from calcium carbonate to happen at an economically useful rate, the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. And for it to happen rapidly, the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101&amp;nbsp;kPa, which happens at 898&amp;nbsp;°C.{{clear right}}

===With varying CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure===
[[File:CanarySpring.jpg|thumb|right|[[Travertine]] calcium carbonate deposits from a [[hot spring]]]]
Calcium carbonate is poorly soluble in pure water (47&amp;nbsp;mg/L at normal atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; partial pressure as shown below).

The equilibrium of its solution is given by the equation (with dissolved calcium carbonate on the right):

This seemingly simple solubility equation, however, must be taken along with the more complicated equilibrium of [[carbon dioxide]] with [[water]] (see [[carbonic acid]]).

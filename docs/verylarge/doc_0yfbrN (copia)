== Transport ==
[[File:Flughafen Walfish Bay Luftaufnahme.jpg|right|thumb|[[Walvis Bay Airport]].]]

Walvis Bay is an important logistical port for the southern African region, providing port facilities for the import and export of cargo for the rest of Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Botswana. Since the Walvis Bay Corridor Group (WBCG) was established in 2000, cargo moving through the port has increased from 30,000 [[intermodal container|containers]] a year to 370,000 containers in 2016.  As of 2017 the port was being upgraded to increase its capacity to move 1 million containers a year by 2019.  Bureaucratic and logistical problems at the city's competitor port at [[Durban]], South Africa have diverted traffic to the port at Walvis Bay. Ninety-five percent of all cargo hauled overland through Walvis Bay is carried by truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/is-this-country-the-new-commercial-gateway-to-southern-africa/80696|title=Is This Country the New Commercial Gateway to Southern Africa?|last=Dall|first=Nick|work=OZY |date=6 September 2017 |access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Walvis Bay Corridor Group is gearing up to increase import/export-business opportunities in Namibia. The Namibian National Development Plan expects to complete the expansion programme of the Walvis Bay port by 2019. Because of the harbour's geographical positioning, authorities plan to gain a footprint in providing landlocked Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries with a vital logistical hub.&lt;ref name=Larkin/&gt; In addition to the importance of the port, development would strengthen trade corridors which consists of current road and rail networks.&lt;ref name=Larkin&gt;{{cite news |title=Walvis Bay aims to become hub for SADC import/export |first=Philippa |last=Larkin |url= https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/companies/walvis-bay-aims-to-become-hub-for-sadc-importexport-8322681 |newspaper=Business Report |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to strengthen and enhance trade relations between other African countries, Namport (the Namibian Port Authority) in April 2019 signed a five-year MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Port Authority of Dakar, Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;https://neweralive.na/posts/namport-and-port-of-dakar-sign-mou&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walvis Bay Airport|Walvis Bay International Airport]] provides commercial flight services to the city's residents, as well as to neighbouring towns and villages. Both [[Air Namibia]] and [[Westair Aviation (Namibia)|Westair Aviation]] service flights between their respective hubs in Windhoek and Walvis Bay.

== Economy ==
=== Tourism ===
[[File:Walvis_Bay_Tourist_sights.webm|thumb|Popular tourist sights around Walvis Bay]]
Tourism has had an increasing influence in the town's economy, with international tourists arriving at its [https://www.airports.com.na/airports/walvis-bay-international-airport/14/ airport] and [https://www.namport.com.na/ports/welcome-to-the-port-of-walvis-bay/522/ port] facilities. Several cruise liners visit the port each year. With many tourism activities hosted by small and large tour operators the town has turned into a tourism destination. Accommodation is varied in both price and style ranges, catering for everyone.  

The natural beauty of the surrounding desert and ocean is quite unique, and definitely a factor in the popularity of Walvis Bay.

===Fishing===
[[File:Oyster farming, Walvis Bay (Namibia).jpg|thumb|[[Oyster]]s are cultivated for export at Walvis Bay]]In Walvis Bay there are different fishing companies like Hangana Seafood, Caroline Fishing, Benguella Fishing Company, Cadilu Fishing, Etosha Fisheries, Kuiseb Fishing Enterprises, Blue Ocean Products, Benguella Sea Products, Consortium Fisheries, Talanam Fish Processor. These companies catch different types of fish like [[Thyrsites|snoek]], [[horse mackerel]], [[anchovy]], [[white steenbras]], kabeljou, [[kingklip]], [[hake]], [[catfish]], [[tuna]] and [[sardines]]. Hangana Seafood are processors and exporters of fish and fish products.
As such, the fishing enterprise accounts for a major part of Walvis Bay's economy.

In May 2018, a spokesman for the National Fishing Corporation of Namibia (Fishcor), confirmed that a new N$530 million onshore processing plant would be operational by September 2018. After completion, the factory (which plans to employ 700 people of which 70% will be female), promises to be the largest pelagic processing plant in sub-Saharan Africa and will process about 80 000 tonnes of fish per annum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newera.com.na/2018/05/14/fishcors-n530-million-factory-ready-by-september/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
In March 2018 the Namibian government in association with French Groupe PSA signed an investment agreement to initiate a joint-venture to assemble [[Opel]] and [[Peugeot]] vehicles in Walvis Bay.  The N$190m-project&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.namibian.com.na/175390/archive-read/N$190m-Peugeot-assembly-plant-for-Nam N$190m Peugeot assembly plant for Nam], ''[[The Namibian]]'', 13 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; has been earmarked to commence in 2018 with a forecasted annual target volume of 5000 units by 2020, a target carried by SACU* countries' market demand.&lt;ref&gt;https://lesstephenson.wordpress.com/2018/03/13/opel-peugeot-to-open-auto-plant-in-remote-walvis-bay/&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peugeot threatened to close the plant over disputes with South Africa over import tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.namibian.com.na/194905/archive-read/Peugeot-threatens-to-shut-assembly-plant Peugeot threatens to shut assembly plant], ''[[The Namibian]]'', 1 November 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

===Container terminal===
In August 2019 a new container terminal was opened, built on a 40-acre platform reclaimed from the sea. The terminal was built by the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company with funds from the Namibian government and the African Development Bank, costing R4.2 billion rand.

This increases the capacity of the port to 750,000 containers per year from 350,000. The terminal also includes a dedicated cruise liner berth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/news-africa/2163093/namibia-inaugurates-r4-2bn-chinese-built-port-terminal/|title=Namibia inaugurates R4.2bn Chinese-built port terminal|last=AFP|website=The Citizen|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="32126" xml:space="preserve">A '''viscometer''' (also called '''viscosimeter''') is an instrument used to measure the [[viscosity]] of a [[fluid]]. For liquids with viscosities which vary with [[flow conditioning|flow conditions]], an instrument called a [[rheometer]] is used. Thus, a rheometer can be considered as a special type of viscometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=H. A. |last2=Hutton |first2=J. F. |last3=Walters |first3=K. |title=An introduction to rheology |date=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-444-87140-4 |page=12 |edition=5. impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viscometers only measure under one flow condition.

In general, either the fluid remains stationary and an object moves through it, or the object is stationary and the fluid moves past it. The drag caused by relative motion of the fluid and a surface is a measure of the viscosity. The flow conditions must have a sufficiently small value of [[Reynolds number]] for there to be [[laminar flow]].

At 20{{nbsp}}°C, the [[Viscosity#Dynamic and kinematic viscosity|dynamic viscosity]] (kinematic viscosity × density) of water is 1.0038{{nbsp}}[[pascal second|mPa·s]] and its [[viscosity#Dynamic and kinematic viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] (product of flow time × factor) is 1.0022{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. These values are used for calibrating certain types of viscometers.

==Standard laboratory viscometers for liquids==
[[File:Ostwaldscher Zähigkeitsmesser.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ostwald viscometers measure the viscosity of a fluid with a known density.]]

===U-tube viscometers===
These devices are also known as glass capillary viscometers or '''Ostwald viscometers''', named after [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]. Another version is the [[Ubbelohde viscometer]], which consists of a U-shaped glass tube held vertically in a controlled temperature bath. In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for the level of the liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. The calibration can be done using a fluid of known properties. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor.

The time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.

Such viscometers can be classified as direct-flow or reverse-flow. Reverse-flow viscometers have the reservoir above the markings, and direct-flow are those with the reservoir below the markings. Such classifications exist so that the level can be determined even when opaque or staining liquids are measured, otherwise the liquid will cover the markings and make it impossible to gauge the time the level passes the mark. This also allows the viscometer to have more than 1 set of marks to allow {{clarify span|for an immediate timing of the time it takes to reach the 3rd mark|date=January 2019}}, therefore yielding 2 timings and allowing subsequent calculation of determinability to ensure accurate results. The use of two timings in one viscometer in a single run is only possible if the sample being measured has [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian properties]]. Otherwise the change in driving head, which in turn changes the shear rate, will produce a different viscosity for the two bulbs.

===Falling-sphere viscometers===
[[File:Terminal velocity.svg|thumb|100px|right|Creeping flow past a sphere]]
[[Stokes' law]] is the basis of the falling-sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches [[terminal velocity]], which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the [[density]] of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the [[viscosity]] of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses [[glycerol]] as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. It includes many different oils and [[polymer]] liquids {{clarify span|such as solutions|date=January 2019}}.

In 1851, [[George Gabriel Stokes]] derived an expression for the frictional force (also called [[drag force]]) exerted on spherical objects with very small [[Reynolds number]]s (e.g., very small particles) in a continuous [[viscosity|viscous]] [[fluid]] by changing the small fluid-mass limit of the generally unsolvable [[Navier–Stokes equations]]:

: &lt;math&gt;F = 6 \pi r \eta v,&lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;'' is the frictional force,
: ''&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;'' is the radius of the spherical object,
: ''&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;'' is the fluid viscosity,
: ''&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;'' is the particle velocity.

If the particles are falling in the viscous fluid by their own weight, then a terminal velocity, also known as the settling velocity, is reached when this frictional force combined with the [[buoyant force]] exactly balance the [[gravitational force]]. The resulting settling velocity (or [[terminal velocity]]) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{s} = \frac{2}{9} \frac{r^2 g (\rho_p - \rho_f)}{\mu},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the particle settling velocity (m/s), vertically downwards if {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}}, upwards if {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}},
: {{mvar|r}} is the [[Stokes radius]] of the particle (m),
: {{mvar|g}} is the [[gravitational acceleration]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[density]] of the particles (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[density]] of the fluid (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{mvar|μ}} is the (dynamic) fluid [[viscosity]] (Pa·s).

Note that [[Stokes flow]] is assumed, so the [[Reynolds number]] must be small.

A limiting factor on the validity of this result is the [[surface roughness|roughness]] of the sphere being used.

A modification of the straight falling-sphere viscometer is a rolling-ball viscometer, which times a ball rolling down a slope whilst immersed in the test fluid. This can be further improved by using a patented V plate, which increases the number of rotations to distance traveled, allowing smaller, more portable devices. The controlled rolling motion of the ball avoids turbulences in the fluid, which would otherwise occur with a falling ball&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=tec-science|date=2020-04-04|title=Experimental determination of viscosity (viscometer)|url=https://www.tec-science.com/mechanics/gases-and-liquids/experimental-determination-of-viscosity/|access-date=2020-06-25|website=tec-science|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This type of device is also suitable for ship board use.{{why?|date=January 2019}}

==Falling-ball viscometer==
In 1932, Fritz Höppler was granted a patent for the falling-ball viscometer, named after him – the worldwide first viscometer to determine the dynamic viscosity. More other world-firsts viscometers developed by Fritz Höppler in Medingen (Germany) are the ball pressure types consistometer and rheoviscometer, see{{where?|date=January 2019}} {{lang|de|Kugeldruckviskosimeter}} = ball pressure viscometer.

==Falling-piston viscometer==
Also known as the Norcross viscometer after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device is based on a piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain [[thixotropic]] liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The [[Fuel viscosity control|viscosity controller]] measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), [[Saybolt universal second]] (SUS) or [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]].

Industrial use is popular due to simplicity, repeatability, low maintenance and longevity. This type of measurement is not affected by flow rate or external vibrations. The principle of operation can be adapted for many different conditions, making it ideal for [[process control]] environments.

==Oscillating-piston viscometer==
Sometimes referred to as electromagnetic viscometer or EMV viscometer, was invented at [http://www.cambridgeviscosity.com Cambridge Viscosity (Formally Cambridge Applied Systems)] in 1986. The sensor (see figure below) comprises a measurement chamber and magnetically influenced piston. Measurements are taken whereby a sample is first introduced into the thermally controlled measurement chamber where the piston resides. Electronics drive the piston into oscillatory motion within the measurement chamber with a controlled magnetic field. A shear stress is imposed on the liquid (or gas) due to the piston travel, and the viscosity is determined by measuring the travel time of the piston. The construction parameters for the annular spacing between the piston and measurement chamber, the strength of the electromagnetic field, and the travel distance of the piston are used to calculate the viscosity according to Newton's Law of Viscosity.
[[File:OPvisc1.JPG|500px|center|Schematic view of oscillating-piston viscometer]]
The oscillating-piston viscometer technology has been adapted for small-sample viscosity and micro-sample viscosity testing in laboratory applications. It has also been adapted to high-pressure viscosity and high-temperature viscosity measurements in both laboratory and process environments. The viscosity sensors have been scaled for a wide range of industrial applications, such as small-size viscometers for use in compressors and engines, flow-through viscometers for dip coating processes, in-line viscometers for use in refineries, and hundreds of other applications. Improvements in sensitivity from modern electronics, is stimulating a growth in oscillating-piston viscometer popularity with academic laboratories exploring gas viscosity.

==Vibrational viscometers==
Vibrational viscometers date back to the 1950s Bendix instrument, which is of a class that operates by measuring the damping of an oscillating electromechanical resonator immersed in a fluid whose viscosity is to be determined. The resonator generally oscillates in torsion or transversely (as a cantilever beam or tuning fork). The higher the viscosity, the larger the damping imposed on the resonator. The resonator's damping may be measured by one of several methods:

# Measuring the power input necessary to keep the oscillator vibrating at a constant amplitude. The higher the viscosity, the more power is needed to maintain the amplitude of oscillation.
# Measuring the decay time of the oscillation once the excitation is switched off. The higher the viscosity, the faster the signal decays.
# Measuring the frequency of the resonator as a function of phase angle between excitation and response waveforms. The higher the viscosity, the larger the frequency change for a given phase change.

The vibrational instrument also suffers from a lack of a defined shear field, which makes it unsuited to measuring the viscosity of a fluid whose flow behaviour is not known beforehand.

Vibrating viscometers are rugged industrial systems used to measure viscosity in the process condition. The active part of the sensor is a vibrating rod. The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed. These viscosity meters are suitable for measuring clogging fluid and high-viscosity fluids, including those with fibers (up to 1000&amp;nbsp;Pa·s). Currently, many industries around the world consider these viscometers to be the most efficient system with which to measure the viscosities of a wide range of fluids; by contrast, rotational viscometers require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating viscometers have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is typically small. Even very [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]] or [[acidic]] fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating, such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as [[SAE steel grades|316L]] [[stainless steel]]. Vibrating viscometers are the most widely used inline instrument to monitor the viscosity of the process fluid in tanks, and pipes.

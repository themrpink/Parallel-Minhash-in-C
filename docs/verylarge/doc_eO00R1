The victory was widely celebrated in Britain; the song &quot;[[Rule Britannia]]&quot; was written in 1740 to mark the occasion and performed for the first time at a dinner in London honouring Vernon.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=23}} The suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello in Edinburgh]] and [[Portobello Road]] in London are among the places in Britain named after this success, while more medals were awarded for its capture than any other event in the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Simms|2008|p=276}}

However, taking a port in Spain's American empire was considered a foregone conclusion by many [[Patriot Whigs]] and opposition [[Tories (political faction)|Tories]]. They now pressed a reluctant Walpole to launch larger naval expeditions to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the longer term, the Spanish replaced the twice yearly ''Flota'' with a larger number of smaller convoys, calling at more ports and Portobelo's economy did not recover until the building of the [[Panama Canal]] nearly two centuries later.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===First attack on Cartagena de Indias (13–20 March 1740)===
[[File:Blas de Lezo unknown author.jpg|thumb|Spanish Admiral Don [[Blas de Lezo]] 1741]]

Following the success of Portobelo, Vernon decided to focus his efforts on the capture of [[Cartagena de Indias]] in present-day Colombia. Both Vernon and [[Edward Trelawny (governor)|Edward Trelawny]], governor of Jamaica, considered the Spanish gold shipping port to be a prime objective. Since the outbreak of the war, and Vernon's arrival in the Caribbean, the British had made a concerted effort to gain intelligence on the defences of Cartagena. In October 1739, Vernon sent First Lieutenant Percival to deliver a letter to [[Blas de Lezo]] and Don Pedro Hidalgo, governor of Cartagena. Percival was to use the opportunity to make a detailed study of the Spanish defences. This effort was thwarted when Percival was denied entry to the port.

On 7 March 1740, in a more direct approach, Vernon undertook a [[Reconnaissance|reconnaissance-in-force]] of the Spanish city. Vernon left [[Port Royal]] in command of a squadron including [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]], two [[fire ship]]s, three [[bomb vessel]]s, and [[troop ship|transport ships]]. Reaching Cartagena on 13 March, Vernon immediately landed several men to map the [[topography]] and to reconnoitre the Spanish squadron anchored in Playa Grande, west of Cartagena. Having not seen any reaction from the Spanish, on 18 March Vernon ordered the three bomb vessels to open fire on the city. Vernon intended to provoke a response that might give him a better idea of the defensive capabilities of the Spanish. Understanding Vernon's motives, Lezo did not immediately respond. Instead, Lezo ordered the removal of guns from some of his ships, in order to form a temporary [[shore battery]] for the purpose of [[suppressive fire]]. Vernon next initiated an [[amphibious assault]], but in the face of strong resistance, the attempt to land 400 soldiers was unsuccessful. The British then undertook a three-day [[naval bombardment]] of the city. In total, the campaign lasted 21 days. Vernon then withdrew his forces, leaving HMS ''Windsor Castle'' and HMS ''Greenwich'' in the vicinity, with a mission to intercept any Spanish ship that might approach.

===Destruction of the fortress of San Lorenzo el Real Chagres (22–24 March 1740)===
[[File:El Castillo de San Lorenzo.jpg|thumb|left|200px| [[Fort San Lorenzo|Fortress of San Lorenzo el Real Chagres]]]]
After the destruction of Portobelo the previous November, Vernon proceeded to remove the last Spanish stronghold in the area. He attacked the [[Fort San Lorenzo|fortress of San Lorenzo el Real Chagres]], in present-day [[Panama]] on the banks of the [[Chagres River]], near Portobelo. The fort was defended by Spanish [[patrol boat]]s, and was armed with four guns and about thirty soldiers under Captain of Infantry Don Juan Carlos Gutiérrez Cevallos.

At 3 pm on 22 March 1740, the British [[squadron (naval)|squadron]], composed of the ships ''[[HMS Strafford (1735)|Stafford]]'', ''[[HMS Norwich (1693)|Norwich]]'', ''[[HMS Falmouth (1708)|Falmouth]]'' and ''[[HMS Swallow (1732)|Princess Louisa]]'', the frigate ''Diamond'', the [[bomb vessel]]s ''Alderney'', ''Terrible'', and ''Cumberland'', the [[fireship]]s ''Success'' and ''Eleanor'', and [[troopship|transports]] ''Goodly'' and ''Pompey'', under command of [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]], began to bombard the Spanish fortress. Given the overwhelming superiority of the British forces, Captain Cevallos surrendered the fort on 24 March, after resisting for two days.

Following the strategy previously applied at Porto Bello, the British destroyed the fort and seized the guns along with two Spanish patrol boats.

During this time of British victories along the Caribbean coast, events taking place in Spain would prove to have a significant effect on the outcome of the largest engagement of the war. Spain had decided to replace Don Pedro Hidalgo as governor of [[Cartagena de Indias]]. But, the new governor-designate, Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies [[Sebastián de Eslava|Sebastián de Eslava y Lazaga]] had first to dodge the [[Royal Navy]] in order to get to his new post. Starting from the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] port of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], the vessels ''Galicia'' and ''San Carlos'' set out on the journey. Hearing the news, Vernon immediately sent four ships to intercept the Spanish. They were unsuccessful in their mission. The Spanish managed to circumvent the British interceptors and entered the port of Cartagena on 21 April 1740, landing there with the new governor and several hundred veteran soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGAOF|Sáez Abad, p. 57]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second attack on Cartagena de Indias (3 May 1740)===
In May, Vernon returned to Cartagena de Indias aboard the flagship {{HMS|Princess Caroline|1728|6}} in charge of 13 warships, with the intention of bombarding the city. Lezo reacted by deploying his six [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] so that the British fleet was forced into ranges where they could only make short or long shots that were of little value. Vernon withdrew, asserting that the attack was merely a manoeuver. The main consequence of this action was to help the Spanish test their defences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGAOF|Sáez Abad, p. 58]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third attack on Cartagena de Indias (13 March – 20 May 1741)===
{{Main|Battle of Cartagena de Indias}}
{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Cartagena - Fortaleza San Felipe de Barajas - 20050430bis.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Castillo San Felipe de Barajas]] ([[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]). This (then incomplete) fortress was integral to Spain's effort to maintain the link with its colonies via the Atlantic [[sea lane]]s.]]
[[File:Guerra de la oreja de Jenkins.png|thumb|250px|British operations in the Caribbean Sea during the War of Jenkins' Ear]]

The largest action of the war was a major [[amphibious warfare|amphibious attack]] launched by the British under Admiral Edward Vernon in March 1741 against Cartagena de Indias, one of Spain's principal gold-trading ports in their colony of New Granada (today [[Colombia]]). Vernon's expedition was hampered by inefficient organisation, his rivalry with the commander of his land forces, and the logistical problems of mounting and maintaining a major trans-Atlantic expedition. The strong fortifications in Cartagena and the able strategy of Spanish Commander [[Blas de Lezo]] were decisive in repelling the attack. Heavy losses on the British side were due in large part to virulent tropical diseases, primarily an outbreak of [[yellow fever]], which took more lives than were lost in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb, pp. 396–398&quot;/&gt;

The extreme ease with which the British destroyed Porto Bello led to a change in British plans. Instead of Vernon concentrating his next attack on Havana as expected, in order to conquer Cuba, he planned to attack [[Cartagena de Indias]]. Located in Colombia, it was the main port of the Viceroyalty and main point of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|West Indian fleet]] for sailing to the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In preparation the British gathered in [[Jamaica]] one of the largest fleets ever assembled. It consisted of 186 ships (60 more than the famous [[Spanish Armada]] of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), bearing 2,620 artillery pieces and more than 27,000 men. Of that number, 10,000 were soldiers responsible for initiating the assault. There were also 12,600 sailors, 1,000 Jamaican slaves and macheteros, and 4,000 recruits from [[Virginia]]. The latter were led by [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)|Lawrence Washington]], the older half-brother of [[George Washington]], future President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;MVLA archives, document W-734&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial officials assigned Admiral Blas de Lezo to defend the fortified city. He was a marine veteran hardened by numerous naval battles in Europe, beginning with the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and by confrontations with European pirates in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, and [[Barbary pirates]] in the Mediterranean Sea. Assisting in that effort were Melchor de Navarrete and Carlos Desnaux, with a squadron of six ships of the line (the flagship vessel ''Galicia'' together with the ''San Felipe,'' ''San Carlos,'' ''África,'' ''Dragón,'' and ''Conquistador'') and a force of 3,000 soldiers, 600 militia and a group of native Indian archers.

Vernon ordered his forces to clear the port of all [[scuttling|scuttled]] ships. On 13 March 1741, he landed a contingent of troops under command of Major General [[Thomas Wentworth (British Army officer)|Thomas Wentworth]] and artillery to take Fort de San Luis de Bocachica. In support of that action, the British ships simultaneously opened with cannon fire, at a rate of 62 shots per hour. In turn, Lezo ordered four of the Spanish ships to aid 500 of his troops defending Desnaux's position, but the Spanish eventually had to retire to the city. Civilians were already evacuating it. After leaving Fort Bocagrande, the Spanish regrouped at [[Castillo San Felipe de Barajas|Fort San Felipe de Barajas]], while Washington's Virginians took up positions in the nearby hill of La Popa. Vernon, believing the victory at hand, sent a message to Jamaica stating that he had taken the city. The report was subsequently forwarded to London, where there was much celebration. Commemorative medals were minted, depicting the defeated Spanish defenders kneeling before Vernon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/2848/figura082ak.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; The robust image of the enemy depicted in the British medals bore little resemblance to Admiral Lezo. Maimed by years of battle, he was one-eyed and lame, with limited use of one hand.

On the evening of 19 April, the British mounted an assault in force upon [[Castillo San Felipe de Barajas]]. Three columns of [[grenadiers]], supported by Jamaicans and several British companies, moved under cover of darkness, with the aid of an intense [[naval bombardment]]. The British fought their way to the base of the fort's [[defensive walls|ramparts]] where they discovered that the Spanish had dug deep trenches. This effectively rendered the British [[Escalade|scaling equipment]] too short for the task. The British advance was stymied since the fort's walls had not been breached, and the ramparts could not be topped. Neither could the British easily withdraw in the face of intense Spanish fire and under the weight of their own equipment. The Spanish seized on this opportunity, with devastating effect.

Reversing the tide of battle, the Spanish initiated a [[fixed bayonet]] charge at first light, inflicting heavy casualties on the British. The surviving British forces retreated to the safety of their ships. The British maintained a naval bombardment, sinking what remained of the small Spanish squadron (after Lezo's decision to [[scuttling|scuttle]] some of his ships in an effort to block the harbour entrance). The Spanish thwarted any British attempt to land another ground assault force. The British troops were forced to remain aboard ship for a month, without sufficient reserves. With supplies running low, and with the outbreak of disease (primarily [[yellow fever]]), which took the lives of many on the crowded ships,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RXgg4cbWhsUC&amp;pg=PT6&amp;lpg=PT6&amp;dq=61st+Foot+Gooch+American+Regiment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Jj7059bmX&amp;sig=Ev_WcinDFXjiqogCUgcqWHf3KMA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pU9uSvaqBZTWNYDo3OQC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5( Chartrand, Rene. '' Colonial American Troops, 1610–1774'', Vol. 1, pp. 18–19 Osprey Men-at-Arms #366, Osprey Publishing 2002] {{ISBN|9781841763248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon was forced to raise the [[siege]] on 9 May and return to Jamaica. Six thousand British died while only one thousand Spanish perished.

Vernon carried on, successfully attacking the Spanish at [[Guantánamo Bay]], Cuba. On 5 March 1742, with the help of reinforcements from Europe, he launched an assault on [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]. In 1742, Vernon was replaced by [[Rear admiral|Rear-Admiral]] [[Chaloner Ogle]] and returned to England, where he gave an accounting to the [[Admiralty]]. He learned that he had been elected [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ipswich]]. Vernon maintained his naval career for another four years before retiring in 1746. In an active Parliamentary career, Vernon advocated for improvements in naval procedures. He continued to hold an interest in naval affairs until his death in 1757.

News of the defeat at Cartagena was a significant factor in the downfall of the British Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning pp. 109–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole's anti-war views were considered by the Opposition to have contributed to his poor prosecution of the war effort. The new government under [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] wanted to shift the focus of Britain's war effort away from the Americas and into the Mediterranean. Spanish policy, dictated by the queen [[Elisabeth Farnese]] of Parma, also shifted to a European focus, to recover lost Spanish possessions in Italy from the Austrians. In 1742, a large British fleet under [[Nicholas Haddock]] was sent to try and intercept a Spanish army being transported from [[Barcelona]] to Italy, which he failed to do having only 10 ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodger p. 239&quot; /&gt; With the arrival of additional ships from Britain in February 1742, Haddock successfully blockaded the Spanish coast&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; failing to force the Spanish fleet into an action. [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)|Lawrence Washington]] survived the yellow fever outbreak, and eventually retired to [[Virginia]]. He named his estate [[Mount Vernon]], in honour of his former commander.

===Anson expedition===
{{further|George Anson's voyage around the world|Wager Mutiny}}
[[File:Samuel Scott 1.jpg|thumb|[[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson's]] capture of a [[Manila galleon]], painted by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]] before 1772]]

The success of the Porto Bello operation led the British, in September 1740, to send a squadron under Commodore [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] to attack [[Spanish East Indies|Spain's possessions in the Pacific]]. Before they reached the Pacific, numerous men had died from disease, and they were in no shape to launch any sort of attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodger p. 238&quot;&gt;Rodger p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Anson reassembled his force in the [[Juan Fernández Islands]], allowing them to recuperate before he moved up the [[Chile]]an coast, raiding the small town of [[Paita]]. He reached [[Acapulco]] too late to intercept the yearly [[Manila galleon]], which had been one of the principal objectives of the expedition. He retreated across the Pacific, running into a storm that forced him to dock for repairs in [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. After this he tried again the following year to intercept the Manila galleon. He accomplished this on 20 June 1743 off [[Cape Espiritu Santo]], capturing more than a million gold coins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodger p. 239&quot;&gt;Rodger p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anson sailed home, arriving in London more than three and a half years after he had set out, having [[circumnavigated the globe]] in the process. Less than a tenth of his forces had survived the expedition. Anson's achievements helped establish his name and wealth in Britain, leading to his appointment as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]].

===Florida===
{{Main|Siege of St. Augustine (1740)}}
In 1740, the inhabitants of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] launched an overland attack on the [[fortification|fortified city]] of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in Florida, supported by a British naval blockade, but were repelled. The British forces led by [[James Oglethorpe]], the Governor of Georgia, [[Siege of St. Augustine|besieged St. Augustine]] for over a month before retreating, and abandoned their [[artillery]] in the process. The failure of the [[Royal Navy]] blockade to prevent supplies reaching the settlement was a crucial factor in the collapse of the siege. Oglethorpe began preparing Georgia for an expected Spanish assault. The Battle of Bloody Mose, where the Spanish and free black forces repelled Oglethorpe's forces at [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Mose]], was also a part of the War of Jenkins' Ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortmose.org/2018/06/13/bloody-battle-of-fort-mose/|title=Bloody Battle of Fort Mose|last=branmarc60|date=2018-06-13|website=Fort Mose Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624155549/https://fortmose.org/2018/06/13/bloody-battle-of-fort-mose/|archive-date=24 June 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French neutrality===
When war broke out in 1739, both Britain and Spain expected that France would join the war on the Spanish side. This played a large role in the tactical calculations of the British. If the Spanish and French were to operate together, they would have a superiority of ninety [[ships of the line]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740, there was an [[invasion scare]] when it was believed that a French fleet at [[Brest, France|Brest]] and a Spanish fleet at [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] were about to combine and launch an invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;Longmate p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this proved not to be the case, the British kept the bulk of their naval and land forces in southern England to act as a [[Deterrence theory|deterrent]].

Many in the British government were afraid to launch a major offensive against the Spanish, for fear that a major British victory would draw France into the war to protect the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;Simms p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Georgia===
{{Main|Invasion of Georgia (1742)}}
In 1742, the Spanish launched an attempt to seize the British colony of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. Manuel de Montiano commanded 2,000 troops, who were landed on [[St Simons Island]] off the coast. General Oglethorpe rallied the local forces and defeated the Spanish regulars at [[Battle of Bloody Marsh|Bloody Marsh]] and [[Battle of Gully Hole Creek|Gully Hole Creek]], forcing them to withdraw. Border clashes between the colonies of Florida and Georgia continued for the next few years, but neither Spain nor Britain undertook offensive operations on the North American mainland.

===Second attack on La Guaira (2 March 1743)===
{{Main|Battle of La Guaira|Battle of Puerto Cabello}}
[[File:Sir Charles Knowles governor.jpg|thumb|Commodore [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Charles Knowles]] in armour, one hand gestures to fortifications and a burning ship]]

The British attacked several locations in the Caribbean with little consequence to the geopolitical situation in the Atlantic. The weakened British forces under Vernon launched an [[Invasion of Cuba (1741)|attack against Cuba]], landing in [[Guantánamo Bay]] with a plan to march the 45 miles to [[Santiago de Cuba]] and capture the city.&lt;ref&gt;Gott p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon clashed with the army commander, and the expedition withdrew when faced with heavier Spanish opposition than expected. Vernon remained in the Caribbean until October 1742, before heading back to Britain; he was replaced by admiral [[Chaloner Ogle]], who took command of a sickly fleet. Less than half the sailors were fit for duty. The following year, a smaller fleet of Royal Navy led by commodore [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Charles Knowles]] raided the Venezuelan coast, on 2 March 1743 attacking newly [[Battle of Guaira|La Guaira]] controlled by Royal [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] whose ships had rendered great assistance to the Spanish navy during War in carrying troops, arms, stores and ammunition from Spain to her colonies, and its destruction would be a severe blow both to the Company and the Spanish Crown.

After a fierce defence by Governor [[:es:Gabriel José de Zuloaga Moyúa|Gabriel José de Zuloaga]]'s troops, Commodore Knowles, having suffered 97 killed and 308 wounded over three days, decided to retire west before sunrise on 6 March. He decided to attack nearby [[Battle of Puerto Cabello|Puerto Cabello]]. Despite his orders to rendezvous at [[Borburata]] Keys—{{convert|4|mi|km}} east of Puerto Cabello—captains of the detached ''Burford'', ''Norwich'', ''Assistance'', and ''Otter'' proceeded to [[Curaçao]]. The commodore angrily followed them in. On 28 March, he sent his smaller ships to cruise off Puerto Cabello, and once his main body had been refitted, went to sea again on 31 March. He struggled against contrary winds and currents for two weeks before finally diverting to the eastern tip of [[Santo Domingo]] by 19 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodger p. 238&quot; /&gt;

===Merger with wider war===
By mid-1742, the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] had broken out in Europe. Principally fought by [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] over possession of [[Silesia]], the war soon engulfed most of the major powers of Europe, who joined two competing alliances. The scale of this new war dwarfed any of the fighting in the Americas, and drew Britain and Spain's attention back to operations on the European continent. The return of Vernon's fleet in 1742 marked the end of major offensive operations in the War of Jenkins' Ear. France entered the war in 1744, emphasizing the European theatre and planning an [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1744)|ambitious invasion of Britain]]. While it ultimately failed, the threat persuaded British policymakers of the dangers of sending significant forces to the Americas which might be needed at home.

Britain did not attempt any additional attacks on Spanish possessions. In 1745, [[William Pepperrell]] of New England led a colonial expedition, supported by a British fleet under Commodore Peter Warren, against the French fortress of [[Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]] off Canada. Pepperrell was knighted for his achievement, but Britain returned Louisbourg to the French by the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-La-Chapelle]] in 1748. A decade later, during the [[Seven Years' War]] (known as the [[French and Indian War]] in the North American theatre), British forces under [[Lord Jeffrey Amherst]] and [[General Wolfe]] recaptured it.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Parkman, ''A Half Century of Conflict II'' and ''Montcalm and Wolfe II''&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=November 2013}}

===Privateering===
The war involved [[privateering]] by both sides. [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Anson]] captured a valuable [[Manila galleon]], but this was more than offset by the numerous Spanish privateering attacks on British shipping along the transatlantic [[triangular trade]] route. They seized hundreds of British ships, looting their goods and slaves, and operated with virtual impunity in the West Indies; they were also active in European waters. The Spanish [[Spanish treasure fleet|convoys]] proved almost unstoppable. During the Austrian phase of the war, the British fleet attacked poorly protected French merchantmen instead.

===Lisbon negotiations===
From August 1746, negotiations began in the city of [[Lisbon]], in neutral Portugal, to try to arrange a peace settlement. The death of [[Philip V of Spain]] had brought his son [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] to the throne, and he was more willing to be conciliatory over the issues of trade. However, because of their commitments to their Austrian allies, the British were unable to agree to Spanish demands for territory in Italy and talks broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge pp. 202–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:BloodyMarshMonument.jpg|thumb|upright|A monument in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] commemorating the [[Battle of Bloody Marsh]]]]

The eventual diplomatic resolution formed part of the wider settlement of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] by the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] which restored the 'status quo ante'.{{sfn|Bemis|1953|p=8}} British territorial and economic ambitions on the Caribbean had been repelled,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Spain's fortifications, fleet and merchant marine were able to repel Great Britain's offensive.

Historical Papers, 5 (1), 1970, pp. 147–157&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the war put an end to the British smuggling, and the Spanish fleet was able to dispatch three treasure convoys to Europe during the war and off-balance the British squadron at Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Ogelsby, pp. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of the ''asiento'' was not mentioned in the treaty, as its importance had lessened for both nations. The issue was finally settled by the 1750 [[Treaty of Madrid (5 October 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] in which Britain agreed to renounce its claim to the ''asiento'' in exchange for a payment of £100,000. The South Sea Company ceased its activity, though the treaty also allowed favourable conditions for British trade with [[Spanish America]].&lt;ref&gt;Simms p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Anson's expedition to the Southeast Pacific led the Spanish authorities in [[Lima]] and [[Santiago]] to advance the position of the Spanish Empire in the area. Forts were thus built in the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago]] in 1749 and 1750.&lt;ref name=Urbina2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbina Carrasco |first=María Ximena |date=2014 |title=El frustrado fuerte de Tenquehuen en el archipiélago de los Chonos, 1750: Dimensión chilota de un conflicto hispano-británico  |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0717-71942014000100006&amp;script=sci_arttext |journal=[[Historia (history of the Americas journal)|Historia]] |volume=47 |issue=I |access-date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Britain and Spain improved temporarily, in subsequent years, due to a concerted effort by the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] to cultivate Spain as an ally. A succession of [[Anglophile]] ministers were appointed in Spain, including [[José de Carvajal]] and [[Ricardo Wall]], all of whom were on good terms with British Ambassador [[Benjamin Keene]], in an effort to avoid a repeat of hostilities. As a result, during the early part of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, Spain remained neutral. However, it later joined the French and lost both [[Siege of Havana|Havana]] and [[British occupation of Manila|Manila]] to the British in 1762, although both were returned as part of the peace settlement.

The War of Jenkins' Ear is commemorated annually on the last Saturday in May at [[Wormsloe]] Plantation in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

'''Wiltshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|t|.|ʃ|ər|,_|-|ʃ|ɪər}}; abbreviated '''Wilts''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wiltshire?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Wiltshire|accessdate=23 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|county]] in [[South West England]] with an area of {{convert|3485|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/lca-5] {{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is landlocked and borders the counties of [[Dorset]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Oxfordshire]] and [[Berkshire]]. The [[county town]] was originally [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]], after which the county is named, but [[Wiltshire Council]] is now based in the county town of [[Trowbridge]]. Within the county's boundary are two [[unitary authority]] areas, Wiltshire and Swindon, governed respectively by Wiltshire Council and [[Swindon Borough Council]].

Wiltshire is characterised by its high [[downland]] and wide valleys. [[Salisbury Plain]] is noted for being the location of the [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] [[stone circle]]s and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the [[British Army]]. The city of [[Salisbury]] is notable for its [[Salisbury Cathedral|medieval cathedral]]. Important [[English country house|country houses]] open to the public include [[Longleat]], near [[Warminster]], and the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]'s [[Stourhead]], near [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]]. It is a UNESCO Cultural and World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=WILTSHIRE'S WORLD HERITAGE SITES|url=https://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/world-heritage-site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy==
The county, in the 9th century written as ''Wiltunscir'', later ''Wiltonshire'', is named after the former county town of [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=246|title=Wiltshire Community History: Wilton|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=13 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725224210/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=246|archive-date=25 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Wiltshire}}
[[File:Stonehenge back wide.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stonehenge]]]]
Wiltshire is notable for its pre-[[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[archaeology]]. The [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]] are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK.

In the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] Britain, as [[Cranborne Chase]] and the [[Somerset Levels]] prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of [[Bedwyn]] was fought in 675 between [[Aescwine of Wessex|Escuin]], a [[Wessex|West Saxon]] nobleman who had seized the throne of [[Seaxburh of Wessex|Queen Saxburga]], and [[King Wulfhere]] of [[Mercia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Michael|title=Kennet &amp; Avon Middle Thames: Pearson's Canal Companion|year=2003 |publisher=Central Waterways Supplies|location=Rugby|isbn=0-907864-97-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 878 the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] invaded the county. Following the [[Norman Conquest]], large areas of the country came into the possession of the crown and the church.

On 31 December 2012, letters patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the royal family to additional persons to be born, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |date=8 January 2013 |page=213 |nolink=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] dated 31 December 2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.}}

Members and relatives of the British royal family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the [[British Empire]], sometimes for extended periods as [[viceroy]]s, or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a [[Counsellor of State]], two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) if the monarch is indisposed or abroad. In the other countries of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State, although they may perform ceremonial and social duties on behalf of individual states or the organisation.

The Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren, hold places in the first sections of the official [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|orders of precedence in England and Wales]], [[Order of precedence in Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Order of precedence in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the royal family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Davies|first = Caroline|date =  24 December 2005|title = First royal Sandringham Christmas for Camilla|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506237/First-royal-Sandringham-Christmas-for-Camilla.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Eden|first = Richard|date =  24 June 2012|title = The Queen tells the Duchess of Cambridge to curtsy to the 'blood princesses'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9351571/The-Queen-tells-the-Duchess-of-Cambridge-to-curtsy-to-the-blood-princesses.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses, such as the daughters of her younger sons.

== Public role ==
The British royal family support [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her state and national duties. Each year the family &quot;carries out over 2,000 official engagements throughout the UK and worldwide&quot;.&lt;ref name=role/&gt; Engagements include state funerals, national festivities, garden parties, receptions, and visits to the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=role&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/role-royal-family|title=The role of the Royal Family|date=2016-03-23|website=The Royal Family|access-date=2019-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the British royal family's public role and activities, it is sometimes referred to by courtiers as &quot;The Firm&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;msn2020&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Harry and Meghan crisis: Royal showdown looms |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/harry-and-meghan-crisis-royal-showdown-looms/ar-BBYSlKf |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=MSN |date=12 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ogara&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Gara |first1=Eilish |title=Financing the firm: how the royal family make their money |url=https://www.newsweek.com/financing-firm-how-royal-family-make-their-money-328393 |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=Newsweek |date=12 June 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Junor |first1=Penny |title=The Firm: The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor |date=2014 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=9780007393336 |edition=Newition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shirmsley&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shirmsley |first1=Robert |title=Royals to royalties: the Firm is in business |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e31c28ac-a341-11e0-8d6d-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=Financial Times |date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the royal family have started their own individual charities. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] started [[The Prince's Trust]], which helps young people in the UK that are disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/about-the-trust/history|title=Our history {{!}} The Prince's Trust|website=www.princes-trust.org.uk|access-date=2019-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] started [[The Princess Royal Trust for Carers]], which helps unpaid carers, giving them emotional support and information about benefit claims and disability aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carercentre.com/about-us/background|title=Background – The Princess Royal Trust For Carers – Hampshire Carer Centre|website=carercentre.com|access-date=2019-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''telecommunications network''' is a group of [[Node (networking)|nodes]] interconnected by [[Link (telecommunications)|links]] that are used to exchange messages between the nodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Design Elements - Telecommunication networks|url=https://conceptdraw.com/a915c3/preview--Design%20Elements%20-%20Telecommunication%20networks|access-date=2014-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224842/https://conceptdraw.com/a915c3/preview--Design%20Elements%20-%20Telecommunication%20networks|archive-date=2014-07-14|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of [[circuit switching]], [[message switching]], or [[packet switching]], to pass messages and signals. For each message, multiple nodes may cooperate to pass the message from an originating node to the a destination node, via multiple network hops. For this routing function each node in the network is assigned a [[network address]] for identification and locating it on the network. The collection of addresses in the network is called the [[address space]] of the network.

Examples of telecommunications networks include [[computer network]]s, the  [[Internet]], the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), the global [[Telex]] network, the aeronautical [[ACARS]] network, and the wireless radio networks of cell phone telecommunication providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telecommunication Network - Types of Telecommunication Networks|url=http://www.wifinotes.com/computer-networks/telecommunication-network.html|access-date=2014-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715071739/http://www.wifinotes.com/computer-networks/telecommunication-network.html|archive-date=2014-07-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network structure==
In general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so called because they can be thought of as being, and often are, separate [[overlay network]]s):
* The [[data plane]] (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network's users' traffic, the actual payload.
* The [[control plane]] carries control information (also known as [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signaling]]).
* The [[management plane]] carries the operations and administration traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.

== {{anchor|data network}}Data networks==
{{Area networks}}
Data networks are used extensively throughout the world for communication between individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The [[Internet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;gorry_MAN&quot; /&gt; is the best example of many data networks&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; from different organizations all operating under a single address space.

Terminals attached to [[IP network]]s like the Internet are addressed using [[IP address]]es. Protocols of the [[Internet protocol suite]] provide the control and routing of messages across the and IP data network. There are many different network structures that IP can be used across to efficiently route messages, for example:
* [[wide area network]]s (WAN)
* [[metropolitan area network]]s (MAN)
* [[local area network]]s (LAN)
* [[Internet area network]]s (IAN)
* [[campus area network]]s (CAN)
* [[virtual private network]]s (VPN)

There are three features that differentiate MANs from LANs or WANs:
# The area of the network size is between LANs and WANs. The MAN will have a physical area between 5 and 50&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# MANs do not generally belong to a single organization. The equipment that interconnects the network, the links, and the MAN itself are often owned by an association or a network provider that provides or leases the service to others.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN/&gt;
# A MAN is a means for sharing resources at high speeds within the network. It often provide connections to WAN networks for access to resources outside the scope of the MAN.&lt;ref name=gorry_MAN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/intro-pages/man.html |title=Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) |publisher=Erg.abdn.ac.uk |access-date=2013-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010082944/http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/intro-pages/man.html |archive-date=2015-10-10 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Datacenter networks also rely highly on TCP/IP for communication across machines. They connect thousands of servers, are designed to be highly robust, provide low latency that is typically up to hundreds of microseconds, and high bandwidth. Datacenter network topology plays a significant role in determining the level of failure resiliency, ease of incremental expansion, communication bandwidth and latency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noormohammadpour|first1=Mohammad|last2=Raghavendra|first2=Cauligi|title=Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Tradeoffs|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials|date=28 July 2018|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1492–1525|doi=10.1109/COMST.2017.2782753|arxiv=1712.03530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity and speed==
In analogy to the improvements in the speed and capacity of digital computers, provided by advances in semiconductor technology and expressed in the bi-yearly doubling of transistor density, which is estimated by [[Moore's law]], the capacity and speed of telecommunications networks has followed similar advances, for similar reasons. In telecommunication, this is expressed in [[Edholm's law]], proposed by and named after Phil Edholm in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cherry |first1=Steven |title=Edholm's law of bandwidth |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=2004 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=58–60 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2004.1309810}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This empirical law holds that the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of telecommunication networks doubles every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time Multiplexed Beam-Forming with Space-Frequency Transformation|last=Deng|first=Wei|last2=Mahmoudi|first2=Reza|last3=van Roermund|first3=Arthur|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9781461450450|location=New York|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is evident in the [[Internet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;/&gt; [[cellular network|cellular]] (mobile), [[Wireless LAN|wireless]] [[local area network]]s (LANs), and [[personal area network]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This development is the consequence of rapid advances in the development of [[MOSFET|metal-oxide-semiconductors]] (MOSFET).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jindal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jindal |first1=Renuka P. |title=From millibits to terabits per second and beyond - Over 60 years of innovation |journal=2009 2nd International Workshop on Electron Devices and Semiconductor Technology |date=2009 |pages=1–6 |doi=10.1109/EDST.2009.5166093 |url=https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/195547|isbn=978-1-4244-3831-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, compare [[Nicholas Adontz|Adontz, Nicholas]]. &quot;Samuel l'Armenien, Roi des Bulgares&quot;, in ''Études Arméno-Byzantines''.

Roman is mentioned as tsar in several historical sources; for example the ''Annals'' by Yahya of [[Antioch]] call Roman &quot;Tsar&quot; and Samuel &quot;Roman's loyal military chief&quot;. However, other historians dispute this theory, as Roman was castrated and so technically could not have claimed the crown. There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from [[Basil II]] and becoming a Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in Abydus ([[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes]]-Cedr. II, 455, 13), but this could be a mere coincidence of names.&lt;/ref&gt; As Samuel struggled to preserve his country's independence from the [[Byzantine Empire]], his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler [[Basil II]].

In his early years Samuel managed to inflict several major defeats on the Byzantines and to launch offensive campaigns into their territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;sam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.ece.ntua.gr/~conster/English/PageData/samuel.htm |title=Samuil of Bulgaria |access-date=2008-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221032619/https://www.cc.ece.ntua.gr/~conster/English/PageData/samuel.htm |archive-date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 10th century, the Bulgarian armies conquered the Serb principality of [[Duklja]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9065243/Samuel |title=Britannica Online – Samuel of Bulgaria |access-date=2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and led campaigns against the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]]. But from 1001, he was forced mainly to defend the Empire against the superior Byzantine armies. Samuel died of a [[heart attack]] on 6 October 1014, two months after the catastrophic [[battle of Kleidion]]. His successors failed to organize a resistance, and in 1018, four years after Samuel's death, the country capitulated, ending the five decades-long [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|Byzantine–Bulgarian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, ''Making of Orthodox Byzantium'', pp. 387-388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel was considered &quot;invincible in power and unsurpassable in strength&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, P., ''The legend of Basil the Bulgar-slayer'', p. 16, {{ISBN|0-521-81530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan. D. F., ed. and tr., ''The life of St Nikon'', Brookline, 1987, pp. 140-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar comments were made even in [[Constantinople]], where [[John Kyriotes]] penned a poem offering a punning comparison between the Bulgarian Emperor and Halley's comet, which appeared in 989.&lt;ref name = &quot;poe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger, G, ''L'épopée byzantine á la fin de dixiéme siécle, 1. Jean Tzimisés; les jeunes années de Basile II, le tueur de Bulgares (969-989)'', Paris 1896, pp. 643-644.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Samuel's reign, Bulgaria gained control of most of the [[Balkans]] (with the notable exception of [[Thrace]]) as far as southern [[Greece]]. He moved the capital from [[Skopje]] to [[Ohrid]],&lt;ref name = &quot;sam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;enc&quot;/&gt;  which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]]'s rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wwfow.chrysostompress.org/about-ochrid|title= About Ohrid|access-date=2008-05-23 }}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the city the seat of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Patriarchate]]. Because of this, his realm is sometimes called the ''[[Western Bulgarian Empire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jGBsGwPJ-ukC&amp;pg=PA142 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''], Edward Gibbon, J. B. Bury, Wildside Press LLC, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8095-9240-1}}, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_G43AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 ''A short history of Yugoslavia from early times to 1966''], Stephen Clissold, Henry Clifford Darby, CUP Archive, 1968, {{ISBN|0-521-09531-X}}, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel's energetic reign restored Bulgarian might on the Balkans, and although the Empire was disestablished after his death, he is regarded as a heroic ruler in Bulgaria,&lt;ref&gt;Andreev, J. ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'' (''Balgarskite hanove i tsare'', ''Българските ханове и царе''), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 127, {{ISBN|954-427-216-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambol.hit.bg/jambol/samuil.htm |title=Bulgaria after Simeon |access-date=2008-02-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205121624/http://www.jambol.hit.bg/jambol/samuil.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Samuel is considered also a heroic ruler in [[North Macedonia]];&lt;ref&gt;There has been no Macedonian state since the days of the Ancient Macedon that was finally abolished in 148 BC and 1945, when Communist Yugoslavia established its constituent republic with such name. It is unlikely that the contemporary Republic of Macedonia founded in 1991, may establish credible historical link to the medieval Samuel's state. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Columbia Encyclopedia, Collier's Encyclopedia, the Great Russian Encyclopedia, Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Cambridge Medieval History, Samuel was Tsar of Bulgaria.&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section [[Samuel_of_Bulgaria#Nomenclature|Nomenclature]]).

===The Cometopuli===

Samuel was the fourth&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Runciman, ''A History of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 217-218.&lt;/ref&gt; and youngest son of [[Nicholas (komes)|count Nicholas]], a Bulgarian noble, who might have been the count of Sredets district (modern-day [[Sofia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prokić |first=Božidar |title=Die Zusätze in der Handschrift des Johannes Scylitzes. Codex Vindobonensis hist. graec. LXXIV. |location=München |year=1906 |page=28 |language=de |oclc=11193528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources suggest that he was a regional count of Prespa district in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Europe in the early Middle Ages. Florin Curta. page 241&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Rhipsime of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adontz |first=Nicholas |title=Samuel l'Armenien, roi des Bulgares |journal=Mar BCLSMP |issue=39 |year=1938 |page=37 |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual name of the dynasty is not known. ''Cometopuli'' is the nickname used by Byzantine historians which is translated as &quot;sons of the count&quot;. The Cometopuli rose to power out of the disorder that occurred in the Bulgarian Empire from 966 to 971.

=== Rus' invasion and the deposition of Boris II ===
{{main article|Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria}}

During the reign of [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Emperor Peter I]], Bulgaria prospered in a long-lasting peace with Byzantium. This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess [[Eirene Lakapena|Maria Lakapina]], granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]]. However, after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken and it was at this time or later that Peter I sent his sons [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris]] and [[Roman of Bulgaria|Roman]] to [[Constantinople]] as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;According to Zlatarski (''History of the Bulgarian state'', I, 2, [http://www.promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_5_3.html pp. 544, 562.]) the sons of Peter I were sent in the Byzantine capital in 963 as one of the term to resettle the peace treaty of 927. According to other historians such as Andreev (''Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria'', p. 41.) the heirs to the Bulgarian throne became hostages per a Bulgarian-Byzantine agreement against the Kievan Rus' in 968.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|a war]] with [[Kievan Rus']] Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father's throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes records:  He [Peter] himself died shortly afterwards, whereupon the sons were sent to Bulgaria to secure the ancestral throne and to restrain the 'children of the counts' from further t. David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, children of one of the powerful counts in Bulgaria, were contemplating an uprising and were unsettling the Bulgars'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rus' invaded Byzantine Thrace in 970, but suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|Battle of Arcadiopolis]]. The new Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimiskes]] used this to his advantage. He quickly invaded Bulgaria the following year, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother [[Roman of Bulgaria]] remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria. Count Nicholas, Samuel's father, who had close ties to the royal court in [[Preslav]],&lt;ref&gt;Blagoeva, B. ''For the origins of Emperor Samuel'' (''Za proizhoda na tsar Samuil'', ''За произхода на цар Самуил''), Исторически преглед, № 2, 1966, стр. 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; died in 970. In the same year&lt;ref name=Cometopuli&gt;&quot;They (the [[Cometopuli]]) make their first appearance under the government of Kekaumenos, the strategos of Larissa ... (980-983)&quot;: Adontz. &quot;Samuel l'Armenien&quot;, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the sons of the count&quot; (the Cometopuli) [[David of Bulgaria|David]], [[Moses of Bulgaria|Moses]], [[Aron of Bulgaria|Aaron]] and Samuel rebelled.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannes Scylitzes. ''Historia''. 2, pp. 346–347&lt;/ref&gt; The series of events are not clear due to contradicting sources, but it is sure that after 971 Samuel and his brothers were the ''de facto'' rulers of the western Bulgarian lands.

In 973, the Cometopuli (described by [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] simply as ''the Bulgarians'')&lt;ref&gt;Vasilka Tăpkova-Zaimova, Bulgarians by Birth: The Comitopuls, Emperor Samuel and their Successors According to Historical Sources and the Historiographic Tradition, East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450, BRILL, 2018, {{ISBN|9004352996}}, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; sent envoys to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in [[Quedlinburg]] in an attempt to secure the protection of their lands.&lt;ref name=delev&gt;Delev, ''12. The decline of the First Bulgarian Empire'' ('' 12. Zalezat na Parvoto Balgarsko Tsarstvo'' ''12. Залезът на Първото българско царство'').&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers ruled together in a [[tetrarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guzelev314315&quot;&gt;Bozhilov, Gyuzelev, 1999, pp. 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt; David ruled the southernmost regions and led the defense of one of the most dangerous border areas, around [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Thessaly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guzelev314315&quot; /&gt; The centres of his possessions were [[Prespa (medieval town)|Prespa]] and [[Kastoria]]. Moses ruled from [[Strumica|Strumitsa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Guzelev314315&quot; /&gt; which would be an outpost for attacks on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast and [[Serres]]. Aaron ruled from Sredets,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guzelev314315&quot; /&gt; and was to defend the main road from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to [[Belgrade]], and to attack [[Thrace]]. Samuel ruled northwestern Bulgaria from the strong fortress of [[Vidin]]. He was also to organize the liberation of the conquered areas to the east, including the old capital Preslav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrov |first=P |title=Rebellion of Peter and Boyan in 976 and struggle of the Cometopuli with Byzantium (Vosstanie Petra i Boyana v 976 i borba Komitopulov s Vizantiei, Восстание Петра и Бояна в 976 г. и борьба Комитопулов с Византией) |journal=Byzantinobulgarica |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=130–132 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some records suggest that David played a major role in this tumultuous period of Bulgarian history.&lt;ref&gt;Zlatarski, p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War with Byzantium ===
[[File:Tzimiskes returns.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimiskes]] returns in triumph in Constantinople with the captured [[Boris II]] and icons from Preslav.]]
After John I Tzimiskes died on 11 January 976, the Cometopuli launched an assault along the whole border. Within a few weeks, however, David was killed by [[Vlach]] vagrants and Moses was fatally injured by a stone during the siege of Serres.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes, pp. 334–335.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers' actions to the south detained many Byzantine troops and eased Samuel's liberation of northeastern Bulgaria; the Byzantine commander was defeated and retreated to [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levchenko |first= М. V |title=Precious sources on the Russo-Byzantine relations in the 9th century (Tsenniy istochnih po vaprosu pussko-vizantiyskih otnosheniy v X veke, Ценный источних по вопросу русско-византийских отношений в X веке |year=1951 |pages=66–68 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolov, G., ''Centralism and regionalism in Bulgaria during the early Middle ages (end of the 7th{{mdash}} beginning of the 11th century'' (''Tsentralizam i regionalizam v rannosrednovekovna Balgariya (kraya na VII{{mdash}} nachaloto na XI v.)'', ''Централизъм и регионализъм в ранносредновековна България (края на VII{{mdash}} началото на ХІ в.)''), София 2005, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Any Bulgarian nobles and officials who had not opposed the Byzantine conquest of the region were executed, and the war continued north of the [[Danube]] until the enemy was scattered and Bulgarian rule was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westberg |first=F |title=Die Fragmente des Toparcha Goticus (Anonymus Tauricus aus dem 10.

After suffering these defeats in the Balkans, the Byzantine Empire descended into civil war. The commander of the Asian army, [[Bardas Scleros]], rebelled in [[Asia Minor]] and sent troops under his son Romanus in Thrace to besiege Constantinople. The new Emperor [[Basil II]] did not have enough manpower to fight both the Bulgarians and the rebels and resorted to treason, conspiracy and complicated diplomatic plots.&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Basil II made many promises to the Bulgarians and Scleros to divert them from allying against him.&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aaron, the eldest living Cometopulus, was tempted by an alliance with the Byzantines and the opportunity to seize power in Bulgaria for himself. He held land in Thrace, a region potentially subject to the Byzantines threat. Basil reached an agreement with Aaron, who asked to marry Basil's sister to seal it. Basil instead sent the wife of one of his officials with the bishop of Sebaste. However, the deceit was uncovered and the bishop was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General history of Stephan from Taron (Vseobshaya istoriya Stepanosa Taronskogo, Всеобщая история Степаноса Таронского |pages=175–176 |language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, negotiations proceeded and concluded in a peace agreement. The historian Scylitzes wrote that Aaron wanted sole power and &quot;sympathized with the Romans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scylitzes, pp. 434–435. In this context, by &quot;Romans&quot; Skylitzes understands &quot;Byzantines&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel learned of the conspiracy and the clash between the two brothers was inevitable. The quarrel broke out in the vicinity of [[Dupnitsa]] on 14 June 976 and ended with the annihilation of Aaron's family&lt;!--in-laws?--&gt;. Only his son, [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], survived because Samuel's son [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria|Gavril Radomir]] pleaded on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrov |first=P |title=Formation and consolidation of the Western Bulgarian state (Obrazuvane i ukrepvane na Zapadnata Balgarska darzhava, Образуване и укрепване на Западната Българска държава) |journal=Гсуифф |volume=53 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=169–170 |language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment on, practically all power and authority in the state were held by Samuel and the danger of an internal conflict was eliminated.

However, another theory suggests that Aaron participated in the [[battle of the Gates of Trajan]] which took place ten years later. According to that theory Aaron was killed on 14 June 987 or 988.&lt;ref&gt;Seibt, ''Untersuchungen'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rozen |first=V.

After the Byzantine plan to use Aaron to cause instability in Bulgaria failed, they tried to encourage the rightful heirs to the throne,&lt;ref&gt;Boris II and Roman were sons of Peter I whose dynasty had ruled Bulgaria since the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Krum of Bulgaria|Krum]] (803-814)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris II]] and Roman, to oppose Samuel. Basil II hoped that they would win the support of the nobles and isolate Samuel or perhaps even start a Bulgarian civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Boris and Roman were sent back in 977&lt;ref&gt;Adontz. &quot;Samuel l'Armenien&quot;, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; but while they were passing through a forest near the border, Boris was killed by Bulgarian guards who were misled by his Byzantine clothing. Roman, who was walking some distance behind, managed to identify himself to the guards.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes, pp. 434–435.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman was taken to Vidin, where he was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Prokić, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel became his first lieutenant and general and together they gathered an army and fought the Byzantines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rozen |first=V.

As the main effort of Basil II were concentrated against the rebel Skleros, Samuel's armies attacked the European possessions of the Byzantine Empire. Samuel invaded not only Thrace and the area of [[Thessaloniki]], but also [[Thessaly]], [[Central Greece|Hellas]] and [[Peloponnese]]. Many Byzantine fortresses fell under Bulgarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes, pp. 435–436.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel wanted to seize the important fortress of [[Larissa]], which controlled the key routes in Thessaly, and from 977 to 983 the town was blockaded. After starvation forced the Byzantines to surrender,&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/67/441.html |title=The Encyclopedia of World History. 2001.

With this victory, Bulgaria had gained influence over most of the southwestern Balkans, although it did not occupy some of these territories. From Larissa, Samuel took the relics of [[Achillius of Larissa|Saint Achilleios]], which were laid in a specially built church of the same name on an island in [[Lake Prespa]].&lt;ref name=sk436&gt;Skylitzes, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kekaumenos]], ''[[Strategikon of Kekaumenos|Strategikon]]'', eds.

The Bulgarian successes in the west raised fears in Constantinople, and after serious preparations, Basil II launched a campaign into the very centre of the Bulgarian Empire&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, G. ''History of the Byzantine state'' (''Istorija Vizantije'', ''Исторijа Византиje''), pp. 391-393.&lt;/ref&gt; to distract Samuel from southern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Diaconus, ''Historia'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

The Byzantines assaulted the city for 20 days, but their attacks proved fruitless and costly: the Bulgarians came out of the city several times, killed many enemy soldiers and captured [[draught animal]]s and [[horse]]s. Eventually, the Bulgarian troops burned the [[siege]] equipment of the Byzantine army, forcing Basil II to withdraw to Thrace, but on 17 August 986,&lt;ref&gt;Rozen, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while passing through the mountains, the Byzantine army was ambushed and routed at the [[battle of the Gates of Trajan|Trajan's Gates Pass]].

After the defeat, the rebellion of [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] diverted the efforts of the Byzantine Empire into another civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilii.htm|title= Roman Emperors – Basil II|access-date=2008-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Rudrawari, pp. 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, G.

By 989, the Bulgarian troops had penetrated deep into Byzantine territory,&lt;ref&gt;John Geometres: Anecdota Graeca, E Codd.

In the south, the Bulgarians marched throughout [[Epirus]] and in the west they seized the area of modern [[Durrës]] (medieval Dyrrhachium or Drach) on the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Zlatarski, pp. 645–647.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vasilyevskiy |first=V.

In 989, Phocas was killed and his followers surrendered, and the following year Basil II reached an agreement with Skleros.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, ''Byzantine State'', pp.303-308&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines focused their attention on Bulgaria,&lt;ref&gt;Zlatarski, pp. 651–652.&lt;/ref&gt; and counter-attacked in 991.&lt;ref&gt;Yahya, PO 23 (1932), pp. 430-431.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen of Taron, p. 198.{{Clarify|pre-text=?|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian army was defeated and Roman was captured while Samuel managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Rozen, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines conquered some areas; in 995, however, the [[Arabs]] invaded Asia Minor and Basil II was forced to move many of his troops to combat this new threat. Samuel quickly regained the lost lands and advanced south. In 996, he defeated the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Thessalonica (995)|battle of Thessaloniki]]. During the battle, Thessaloniki's governor, Gregorios, perished and his son [[Ashot Taronites|Ashot]] was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; Elated by this success, the Bulgarians continued south. They marched through Thessaly, overcame the defensive wall at [[Thermopylae]] and entered the Peloponnese, devastating everything on their way.&lt;ref&gt;Skylitzes, pp. 449–450&lt;/ref&gt;

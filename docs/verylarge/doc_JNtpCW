In 1943, Lockheed began, in secrecy, development of a new jet fighter at its Burbank facility. This fighter, the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]], became the first American jet fighter to score a kill. It also recorded the first jet-to-jet aerial kill, downing a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] in Korea, although by this time the F-80 (as it was redesignated in June 1948) was already considered obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Baugher, Joe. [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p80_12.html &quot;Lockheed P-80/F-80 Shooting Star.&quot;] ''USAF Fighter,'' July 16, 1999. Retrieved: June 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the P-80, Lockheed's secret development work was conducted by its Advanced Development Division, more commonly known as the [[Skunk works]]. The name was taken from [[Al Capp]]'s comic strip [[Li'l Abner]]. This organization has become famous and spawned many successful Lockheed designs, including the U-2 (late 1950s), SR-71 Blackbird (1962) and F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter (1978). The Skunk Works often created high-quality designs in a short time and sometimes with limited resources.

===Projects during the Cold War===
{{one source|section|date=July 2015}}
In 1954, the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], a durable four-engined transport, flew for the first time. This type remains in production today. In 1956, Lockheed received a contract for the development of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile ([[Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile|SLBM]]); it would be followed by the Poseidon and Trident nuclear missiles. Lockheed developed the [[F-104 Starfighter]] in the late 1950s, the world's first Mach 2 fighter jet. In the early 1960s, the company introduced the [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141 Starlifter]] four-engine jet transport.

During the 1960s, Lockheed began development for two large aircraft: the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]] military transport and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011 TriStar]] [[wide-body]] civil airliner. Both projects encountered delays and cost overruns. The C-5 was built to vague initial requirements and suffered from structural weaknesses, which Lockheed was forced to correct at its own expense. The TriStar competed for the same market as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]; delays in [[Rolls-Royce RB211|Rolls-Royce]] engine development caused the TriStar to fall behind the DC-10. The C-5 and L-1011 projects, the canceled U.S. Army [[AH-56 Cheyenne]] helicopter program, and embroiled shipbuilding contracts caused Lockheed to lose large sums of money during the 1970s.

Drowning in debt, in 1971 Lockheed (then the largest US defense contractor) asked the US government for a loan guarantee, to avoid insolvency. Lockheed argued that a government bailout was necessary due to the company's value for U.S. national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Irwin|first=Neil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-comparing-bailouts.html|title=A Taxonomy of Bailouts: Comparing the Coronavirus Rescues With Rescues Past|date=2020-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was hotly debated in the US Senate. The chief antagonist was Senator [[William Proxmire]] (D-Wis), the nemesis of Lockheed and its chairman, [[Daniel J. Haughton]]. Following a fierce debate, Vice President [[Spiro T. Agnew]] cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of the measure (August 1971). Lockheed finished paying off the $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion loan in 1977, along with about $112.22&amp;nbsp;million in loan guarantee fees.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, T.P.

===Bribery scandals===
{{main|Lockheed bribery scandals}}
The Lockheed bribery scandals were a series of illegal [[bribery|bribes]] and contributions made by Lockheed officials from the late 1950s to the 1970s. In late 1975 and early 1976, a subcommittee of the [[U.S. Senate]] led by Senator [[Frank Church]] concluded that members of the Lockheed board had paid members of friendly governments to guarantee contracts for military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fjs.de/faq5.html |title=Fragen zur politischen Biographie |website=Franz Josef Strau√ü |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121151324/http://www.fjs.de/faq5.html |archive-date=January 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, it was publicly revealed that Lockheed had paid $22&amp;nbsp;million in bribes to foreign officials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917751-1,00.html &quot;Monday, August 18, 1975.&quot;] ''Time magazine'', August 18, 1975. Retrieved: September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in the process of negotiating the sale of aircraft including the F-104 Starfighter, the so-called Deal of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=113 Lockheed F-104 Starfighter] at militaryfactory.com, Retrieved August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1962 Lockheed Corporation made the deal of the century by selling West Germany three hundred and fifty F-104 Starfighters...&quot; Paul Emil Erdman, ''The last days of America'': G.K. Hall, 1982 {{ISBN|0-8161-3349-2}}, p 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal caused considerable political controversy in [[West Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], Italy, and Japan. In the US, the scandal led to passage of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]], and nearly led to the ailing corporation's downfall (it was already struggling due to the poor sales of the [[Lockheed L-1011|L-1011]] airliner). Haughton resigned his post as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/14/archives/2-lockheed-officials-quit-haack-is-interim-chairman-2-top-lockheed.html|title=2 Lockheed Officials Quit; Haack Is Interim Chairman|last=Lindsey|first=Robert|date=February 14, 1976|website=N.Y. Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted leveraged buyout===
In the late 1980s, [[leveraged buyout]] specialist [[Harold Simmons]] conducted a widely publicized but unsuccessful takeover attempt on the Lockheed Corporation, having gradually acquired almost 20 percent of its stock. Lockheed was attractive to Simmons because one of its primary investors was the [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System]] (CalPERS), the pension fund of the state of California. At the time, the ''New York Times'' said, &quot;Much of Mr. Simmons's interest in Lockheed is believed to stem from its pension plan, which is over funded by more than $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Analysts said he might want to liquidate the plan and pay out the excess funds to shareholders, including himself.&quot; Citing the mismanagement by its chairman, [[Daniel M. Tellep]], Simmons stated a wish to replace its board with a slate of his own choosing, since he was the largest investor. His board nominations included former Texas Senator [[John Tower]], the onetime chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], and Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt Jr]]., a former Chief of Naval Operations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Thomas. &quot;Lockheed Fends Off Simmons&quot;, ''The New York Times'', March 19, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Stevenson, &quot;Simmons Is Considering Possible Lockheed Bid&quot;, ''The New York Times'', February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons had first begun accumulating Lockheed stock in early 1989 when deep Pentagon cuts to the defense budget had driven down prices of military contractor stocks, and analysts had not believed he would attempt the takeover since he was also at the time pursuing control of [[Georgia Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Simmons to Lift Lockheed Stake.&quot; ''The New York Times'', November 22, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|left|General distribution of [[temperate rainforest]]s]]

Tropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but '''temperate rainforests''' only occur in few regions around the world. Temperate rainforests are rainforests in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions. They occur in [[North America]] (in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]]), in [[Europe]] (parts of the [[British Isles]] such as the coastal areas of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], [[southern Norway]], parts of the western [[Balkans]] along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, as well as in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and coastal areas of the eastern [[Black Sea]], including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and coastal [[Turkey]]), in [[East Asia]] (in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]], Highlands of [[Taiwan]], much of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], and on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] and the adjacent [[Temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East|Russian Far East]] coast), in [[South America]] (southern [[Chile]]) and also in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/temprain.htm|title= The Temperate Rainforest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layers==
{{main|Stratification (vegetation)}}
A tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area. Examples include the emergent, [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], [[understory]] and [[forest floor]] layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denslow|first=J S|date=November 1987|title=Tropical Rainforest Gaps and Tree Species Diversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=18|issue=1|pages=431‚Äì451|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.002243|issn=0066-4162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergent layer===
The '''emergent layer''' contains a small number of very large [[tree]]s called '''emergents''', which grow above the general [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]], reaching heights of 45‚Äì55 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70‚Äì80 m tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bourgeron |first= Patrick S.|editor= Frank B. Golley |title=Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystems.

[[Eagle]]s, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bat]]s and certain [[monkey]]s inhabit this layer.

===Canopy layer===
{{Main|Canopy (biology)}}
The '''canopy''' layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically {{convert|30|m}} to {{convert|45|m}} tall. The densest areas of [[biodiversity]] are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species. [[Epiphyte|Epiphytic plants]] attach to [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and [[branch]]es, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer but more diverse. A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy. Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it. As long ago as 1917, [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[William Beebe]] declared that &quot;another continent of life remains to be discovered, not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of square miles.&quot; A true exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using [[crossbow]]s. [[Canopy research|Exploration of the canopy]] is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and [[airship]]s to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor. The science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called [[dendronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dendronautics.org/ Dendronautics ‚Äì Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614070953/http://www.dendronautics.org/ |date=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understory layer===
{{Main|Understory}}
The '''understory''' or '''understorey''' layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is home to a number of [[bird]]s, [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, as well as [[predation|predators]] such as [[jaguar]]s, [[boa (genus)|boa constrictors]] and [[leopard]]s. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant. Many [[seedling]]s that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory. This layer can be called a ''[[shrub layer]]'', although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer.

===Forest floor===
{{main|Forest floor}}

[[File:Forest in the bluemountains.jpg|thumb|Rainforest in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], [[Australia]]]]
The '''forest floor''', the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants [[Adaptation|adapted]] to low light can grow in this region. Away from [[river]]banks, [[swamp]]s and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. It also contains [[decomposition|decaying]] plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of [[Fungus|fungi]] growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Ursus americanus kermodei, Great Bear Rainforest 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Kermode bear]] from the [[Great Bear Rainforest]]]]
More than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm |title=Rainforest Facts |publisher=Rain-tree.com |access-date=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforests support a very broad array of [[fauna]], including [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.  Mammals may include [[primate]]s, [[felidae|felids]] and other families.  Reptiles include [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[chameleon]]s and other families; while birds include such families as [[vanga|vangidae]] and [[cuckoo|Cuculidae]]. Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests. [[Fungus|Fungi]] are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals.

The great diversity in rainforest species is in large part the result of diverse and numerous physical [[Refuge (ecology)|refuges]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RitchieJohnson2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritchie|first1=Euan G.|last2=Johnson|first2=Christopher N.|title=Predator interactions, mesopredator release and biodiversity conservation|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=12|issue=9|year=2009|pages=982‚Äì998|issn=1461-023X|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01347.x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/77c158ac921d9ec20fc67d5e9d509d733fc289ca|pmid=19614756|s2cid=11744558}},&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. places in which plants are inaccessible to many herbivores, or in which animals can hide from predators.

==Soils==
{{More citations needed section
| date = February 2020
}}
Despite the growth of [[vegetation]] in a tropical rainforest, [[soil quality]] is often quite poor. Rapid [[bacteria]]l decay prevents the accumulation of [[humus]]. The concentration of [[iron]] and [[aluminium]] [[oxide]]s by the [[Laterite|laterization]] process gives the [[oxisol]]s a bright red colour and sometimes produces [[mineral]] [[deposition (geology)|deposits]] such as [[bauxite]]. Most trees have roots near the surface because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, especially of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off, and beginning a process of soil [[erosion]]. Eventually, streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible. There are several reasons for the poor soil quality. First is that the soil is highly acidic. The roots of plants rely on an acidity difference between the roots and the soil in order to absorb nutrients. When the soil is acidic, there is little difference, and therefore little absorption of nutrients from the soil. Second, the type of clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients and stop them from washing away. Even if humans artificially add nutrients to the soil, the nutrients mostly wash away and are not absorbed by the plants. Finally, these soils are poor due to the high volume of rain in tropical rainforests washes nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in other climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baird |first1=Dr. Chris S. |title=What makes the soil in tropical rainforests so rich? |url=http://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/07/12/what-makes-the-soil-in-tropical-rainforests-so-rich/ |website=Science Questions with Surprising Answers |access-date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on global climate==
A natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of [[carbon dioxide]]. On a global scale, long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/pdf/TAR-03.PDF |title=Grida.no |access-date=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they may have other climatic effects (on [[cloud]] formation, for example, by recycling [[water vapour]]). No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed.&lt;ref name = Lewis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Phillips | first2 = O.L. | last3 = Baker | first3 = T.R. | last4 = Lloyd | first4 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Concerted changes in tropical forest structure and dynamics: evidence from 50 South American long-term plots | journal = Phil.

'''Flash Gordon''' is the protagonist of a [[space opera]] adventure [[comic strip]] created by and originally drawn by [[Alex Raymond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Guy|editor-last=Haley|chapter=Flash Gordon|title=Sci-Fi Chronicles : A Visual History of the Galaxy's Greatest Science Fiction|publisher=Firefly Books|location=Richmond Hill, Ontario|date=2014|isbn=9781770852648|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by, and created to compete with, the already established ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' adventure strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Peter|editor1-last=Nicholls|editor1-link=Peter Nicholls (writer)|editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Brosnan|editor2-link=John Brosnan|editor3-first=David|editor3-last=Langford|editor4-first=Gary|editor4-last=Westfahl|editor4-link=Gary Westfahl|editor5-first=John|editor5-last=Clute|chapter=Flash Gordon|chapter-url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/flash_gordon|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[Orbit Books]]|location=London, England|date=2015|accessdate=19 April 2015|title-link=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter|last1=Poplaski|first2=Alex|last2=Raymond|author2-link=Alex Raymond|chapter=Introduction|title=Flash Gordon Volume One: Mongo, the Planet of Doom|editor-first=Al|editor-last=Williamson|editor-link=Al Williamson|publisher=Kitchen Sink Press|location=Princeton, Wisconsin|date=1990|isbn=0878161147|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Marguerite|last=Cotto|chapter=Flash Gordon|editor1-first=Ray B.|editor1-last=Brown|editor2-first=Pat|editor2-last=Browne|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|date=2001|isbn=0879728213|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip has been translated into a wide variety of media, including motion pictures, television, and animated series. The latest version, [[Flash Gordon (2007 TV series)|a ''Flash Gordon'' television series]], appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the United States in 2007&amp;ndash;2008.

==Creation==
[[File:Flash Gordon (King Features Syndicate debut).jpg|thumb|250px|The first ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip (1934).]]
The ''Buck Rogers'' comic strip had been commercially very successful, spawning novelizations and children's toys,&lt;ref name=&quot;dm&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Doug|last=Murray|authorlink=Doug Murray (comics)|chapter=Birth of a Legend|editor1-first=Alex|editor1-last=Raymond|editor2-first=Don|editor2-last=Moore|title=Flash Gordon : On the Planet Mongo: Sundays 1934-37|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London, England|date=2012|isbn=9780857681546|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[King Features Syndicate]] decided to create their own science fiction comic strip to compete with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfe&quot; /&gt; At first, King Features tried to purchase the rights to the ''[[John Carter of Mars]]'' stories by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. However, the syndicate was unable to reach an agreement with Burroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Fenton|title=Edgar Rice Burroughs and Tarzan : A Biography of the author and his creation|publisher=[[McFarland (publisher)|McFarland]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=2003|isbn=078641393X|page=125|quote=Mrs Jensen, ERB's secretary, recalled the author negotiating with King Features Syndicate for a Martian strip, based on the exploits of John Carter, but it never came off. A short time later the Hearst syndicate started &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, drawn by Alex Raymond...}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Features then turned to Alex Raymond, one of their staff artists, to create the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dm&quot;/&gt;

One source for Flash Gordon was the [[Philip Wylie]] novel ''[[When Worlds Collide]]'' (1933). The themes of an approaching planet threatening the Earth, and an athletic hero, his girlfriend, and a scientist traveling to the new planet by rocket, were adapted by Raymond for the initial storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp1990&quot;&gt;[[Al Williamson|Williamson, Al]]; Poplaski, Peter (1990). &quot;Introduction&quot; to Alex Raymond, ''Flash Gordon:Mongo, the Planet of Doom''. Princeton [WI]: Kitchen Sink Press. 1990. {{ISBN|0878161147}}  (p. 5). &quot;Raymond took the basic premise of Philip Wylie's ''When Worlds Collide'', which was being reprinted in ''Blue Book'' magazine at the time, and used it as his starting point for adventure.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond's first samples were dismissed for not containing enough action sequences. Raymond reworked the story and sent it back to the syndicate, who accepted it. Raymond was partnered with [[ghostwriter]] Don Moore, an experienced editor and writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm&quot;/&gt; Raymond's first ''Flash Gordon'' story appeared in January 1934, alongside ''[[Jungle Jim]]''. The ''Flash Gordon'' strip was well received by newspaper readers, becoming one of the most popular American comic strips of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dm&quot;/&gt;

As with ''Buck Rogers'', the success of ''Flash Gordon'' resulted in numerous licensed products being sold, including [[pop-up book]]s, [[coloring book]]s, and toy spaceships and rayguns.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm2&quot;&gt;Murray, Doug (2012). &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers The World&quot;. In Alex Raymond and Don Moore, ''Flash Gordon :the Tyrant of Mongo, Sundays 1937-41''. London : Titan Books, 2012. {{ISBN|9780857683793}}  (pp. 6-9).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic strip characters and story==
The ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip ran as a daily from 1934 to 1992, with the Sunday strip continuing until 2003. Reprints are still being syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate]].

[[File:Flashgordon22534.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Alex Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'' (February 25, 1934)]]
The comic strip follows the adventures of Flash Gordon, a handsome polo player and [[Yale University]] graduate, and his companions [[Dale Arden]] and Dr. [[Hans Zarkov]]. The story begins with Earth threatened by a collision with the planet [[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]]. Dr. Zarkov invents a rocket ship to fly into space in an attempt to stop the disaster. Half mad, he kidnaps Flash and Dale. Landing on the planet, and halting the collision, they come into conflict with [[Ming the Merciless]], Mongo's evil ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Rovin|authorlink=Jeff Rovin|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Super Villains]]|publisher=Facts on File Publications|location=New York City|date=1987|isbn=081601356X|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the three companions have adventures on Mongo, traveling to the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by [[Prince Barin]]; the ice kingdom of Frigia, ruled by Queen Fria; the jungle kingdom of Tropica, ruled by Queen Desira; the undersea kingdom of the Shark Men, ruled by King Kala; and the flying city of the Hawkmen, ruled by [[Prince Vultan]]. They are joined in several early adventures by [[Prince Thun]] of the Lion Men. Eventually, Ming is overthrown, and Mongo is ruled by a council of leaders led by Barin.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;

Flash and friends visit Earth for a series of adventures before returning to Mongo and crashing in the kingdom of Tropica, later reuniting with Barin and others. Flash and his friends then travel to other worlds before returning once again to Mongo, where [[Prince Barin]], married to Ming's daughter [[Princess Aura]], has established a peaceful rule (except for frequent revolts led by Ming or by one of his many descendants).&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;

In the 1950s, Flash became an astronaut who travelled to other planets besides Mongo.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt; The long story of the Skorpi War takes Flash to other star systems, using starships that are [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]].

In addition to Ming and his allies, Flash and his friends also fought several other villains, including Azura, the Witch Queen; Brukka, chieftain of the giants of Frigia;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jr&quot; /&gt; the [[Fascism|fascistic]] Red Sword organisation on Earth; and Brazor, the tyrannical usurper of Tropica.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Federico|last=López Sacasau|title=Diccionario Básico del Cómic|publisher=Acento|location=Madrid, Spain|date=1998 |pages=59–60|isbn=8448303113}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Raymond's tenure, later writers created new enemies for Flash to combat. Austin Briggs created Kang the Cruel, Ming's callous son.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt; Prince Polon, who had the power to shrink or enlarge living creatures, the unscrupulous Queen Rubia, and Pyron the Comet Master were among the antagonists introduced during Mac Raboy's run.&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot; /&gt; The Skorpi, a race of alien shape shifters who desired to conquer the galaxy, were recurring villains in both the Mac Raboy and Dan Barry stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt; The Skorpi space-fighter [[Flying ace|ace]] Baron Dak-Tula became a periodic nemesis of Flash in the late 1970s stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot; /&gt;

==International versions of the comic strip==
[[File:Warsaw Uprising Flash Gordon.jpeg|thumb|right|A young corporal of the [[Home Army]] reading a Polish edition of one of Flash Gordon (&quot;Błysk Gordon - Królowa Błękitnej Magii&quot;) graphic novels during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944]]
King Features sold the ''Flash Gordon'' strip to newspapers across the world, and by the late 1930s, the strip was published in 130 newspapers, translated into eight foreign languages, and was read by 50 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Doug|last=Murray|chapter=Flash Gordon at War|editor1-first=Alex|editor1-last=Raymond|editor1-link=Alex Raymond|editor2-first=Don|editor2-last=Moore|title=Flash Gordon: The Fall of Ming, Sundays 1941-44|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London, England|date=2013|isbn=9780857686886|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s, several newspapers in Britain carried ''Flash Gordon'', including the Scottish ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]''. In France, his adventures were published in the magazine ''Robinson'', under the name &quot;Guy l'Éclair&quot;. Dale Arden was named Camille in the French translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joel E.|last=Vessels|title=Drawing France: French comics and the Republic|url=https://archive.org/details/drawingfrancefre00vess|url-access=limited|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=Jackson, Mississippi|date=2010|isbn=9781604734454|page=[https://archive.org/details/drawingfrancefre00vess/page/n74 62]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the character and strip were retitled ''Speed Gordon'' to avoid a negative connotation of the word &quot;Flash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Toby|last1=Burrows|first2=Grant|last2=Stone|title=Comics in Australia and New Zealand|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|date=1994|isbn=978-1560246640|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, the predominant meaning of &quot;flashy&quot; was &quot;showy&quot;, connoting dishonesty.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Lambert|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/LambertonAND.php |title=ANDC &amp;ndash; The Australian National Dictionary: Additions and Corrections |publisher=Anu.edu.au |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, events in the 1930s affected the strip's distribution. Newspapers in [[Nazi Germany]] were forbidden to carry the ''Flash Gordon'' strip, while in [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Fascist Italy]] it was restricted to two newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm3&quot; /&gt; In 1938, the Spanish magazine ''Aventurero'', the only publication in the country to carry ''Flash Gordon'', ceased publication because of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot; /&gt; The outbreak of [[World War II]] resulted in ''Flash Gordon'' being discontinued in many countries. In [[Belgium]], artist [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs]] was therefore asked to bring the current ''Flash Gordon'' story to a satisfactory conclusion, which he did.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;n&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Philippe|last1=Biermé|first2=François-Xavier|last2=Nève|title=Chez Edgar P. Jacobs : dans l'intimité du père de Blake et Mortimer|location=Liège, Belgium|publisher=CEFAL|date=2004|isbn=2871301913|page=55|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war's end, the strip enjoyed a resurgence in international popularity. ''Flash Gordon'' reappeared in Italy, Spain and West Germany, and it was also syndicated to new markets like [[Portugal]] and the [[Irish Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot; /&gt; From the 1950s onward, countries like Spain, Italy and Denmark also reprinted ''Flash Gordon'' newspaper strips in comic book or paperback novel form.&lt;ref name=&quot;flp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Franco|last=Fossati|chapter=Flash Gordon|title=I Grandi Eroi del Fumetto|publisher=Gremese, Editore|location=Rome, Italy|date=1990|isbn=8876054960|pages=107–110|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, ''Flash Gordon'' comics were published by [[Indrajal Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Karline|last=McLain|title=India's immortal comic books: gods, kings, and other heroes|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=2009|isbn=9780253352774|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
The popularity of Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'' Sunday strip meant a daily strip was also introduced. This strip was drawn by [[Austin Briggs]] and ran from 1941 to 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;wr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Walt|last=Reed|title=Great American illustrators|publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group]]|location=New York City|date=1979|isbn=0896590755|page=[https://archive.org/details/greatamericanill0000reed/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanill0000reed/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Raymond left ''Flash Gordon'' in 1944 to join the US Marines, the daily strip was cancelled and Briggs took over the Sunday strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;wr&quot; /&gt; Although Raymond wanted to return to drawing ''Flash Gordon'' after the war's end, King Features did not want to remove Briggs from his position.&lt;ref name=&quot;wr&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Ron|last=Goulart|authorlink=Ron Goulart|title=The Funnies: 100 Years of American comic strips|publisher=[[Adams Publishing]]|location=Holbrook, Massachusetts|date=1995|isbn=1-55850-539-3|pages=174, 196}}&lt;/ref&gt; To conciliate Raymond, King Features allowed him to create a new strip, ''[[Rip Kirby]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt; After Briggs left the Sunday strip in 1948, he was succeeded by former comic book artist [[Mac Raboy]], who drew the strip until his death in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;df&quot;&gt;[[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], ''Heroes Of The Comics:Portraits of the Pioneering Legends of the Comic Books''. Seattle, Washington : Fantagraphics Books, 2014. {{ISBN|9781606997314}} (pp. 40,82)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, King Features created a new daily ''Flash Gordon'' strip. This strip was drawn by [[Dan Barry (cartoonist)|Dan Barry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt; Barry was assisted during his tenure by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], who both wrote scripts for the strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;df&quot; /&gt; Barry also had several artists who aided him with ''Flash Gordon's'' illustrations, including [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Al Williamson]], Bob Fujitani, [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], [[Sy Barry]], [[Fred Kida]] and Emil Gershwin.&lt;ref name=&quot;rg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aw&quot;&gt;Mark Schultz, ''Al Williamson's Flash Gordon : a lifelong vision of the heroic.''

==Critical reception and influence==
''Flash Gordon'' is regarded as one of the best illustrated and most influential of American adventure comic strips.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rch&quot;&gt;R.C. Harvey (Jan 2009). &quot;Alex Raymond at Last&quot;. The Comics Journal (295): 161–173. ISSN 0194-7869.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science fiction art Jane Frank asserted that because of his work on ''Flash Gordon'', &quot;Raymond is one of the most famous science fiction artists of all time, although he never contributed an illustration to any science fiction magazine or book&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Frank, ''Science Fiction And Fantasy Artists Of The Twentieth Century : a biographical dictionary'' Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland &amp; Co.,2009 {{ISBN|9780786434237}} (p. 392-3).&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book artist [[Jerry Robinson]] has said &quot;What made ''Flash Gordon'' a classic strip was Raymond's artistry and the rich imagination he brought to his conceptions of the future&quot; and described the final years of Raymond's tenure on the strip as being characterized by &quot;sleek, brilliantly polished brush work.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''The Comics : An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art''. Milwaukie, Or. : Dark Horse Comics, 2010. (p.189 )&lt;/ref&gt; The science fiction historian [[John Clute]] has stated that &quot;The comics version of ''Flash Gordon'' was graceful, imaginative and soaring&quot; and included it on a list of the most important American science fiction comics.&lt;ref&gt;John Clute, ''Science Fiction : The Illustrated Encyclopedia''. New York : Kindersley, 1995. {{ISBN|0789401851}}  (pp. 242,255).&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about Raymond for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', R.C. Harvey declared that Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'' displayed &quot;a technical virtuosity matched on the comics pages only by [[Hal Foster|Harold Foster]] in ''[[Prince Valiant]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rch&quot;/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' stated that ''Flash Gordon''{{'}}s &quot;elaborately shaded style and exotic storyline&quot; made it one of the most influential comics, and that its art emphasized a &quot;romantic [[baroque]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfe&quot; /&gt;

''Flash Gordon'' (along with ''Buck Rogers'') was a big influence on later science fiction comic strips, such as the American ''Don Dixon and the Hidden Empire'' (1935 to 1941) by [[Carl Pfeufer]] and Bob Moore.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp&quot;/&gt; In Italy, Guido Fantoni drew Flash Gordon in 1938, after the prohibition by the fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-403/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #403]&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, Edgar P. Jacobs was commissioned to produce a [[science fiction]] comic strip in the style of ''Flash Gordon''. Jacobs' new strip, ''[[Le Rayon U]]'' (&quot;The U-Ray&quot;) began serial publication in ''Bravo'' in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;n&quot;/&gt; This version had text boxes which described the action and the dialogue, in the style of many Belgian comics of the time, similar to [[Hal Foster]]'s version of ''[[Tarzan]]'' and ''[[Prince Valiant]]''. In 1974, Jacobs reformatted ''Le Rayon U'' in order to include speech bubbles. This version was published in ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine and in book form by [[Dargaud]]-[[Le Lombard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;n&quot;/&gt; The British comic ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'', by [[Mike Butterworth]] and [[Don Lawrence]], also drew on ''Flash Gordon'' for its artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This is one page of &quot;The Trigan Empire&quot;, a ''Look and Learn'' book for 1971. This 71-page story is genuine SF in the style of ''Flash Gordon''&quot;. [[David A. Kyle]], ''The Illustrated Book of Science Fiction Ideas and Dreams''. London, Hamlyn, 1977 {{ISBN|0600382486}} (p.50).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flash Gordon'' was also an influence on early [[superhero comics]] characters. [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] based [[Superman]]'s uniform of tights and a cape on costumes worn by Flash Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;If Superman's tights and cape suggested a circus performer, they were also standard equipment for the humanoid denizens of outer space familiar to Siegel and Shuster from the pulp magazines, and from comic strips like Alex Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'', which had made its debut at the beginning of the year.&quot; [[Les Daniels]], ''Superman : The Complete History, the life and times of the Man Of Steel''. San Francisco, Calif. : Chronicle Books, 1998.{{ISBN|0811821110}}. (p.9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arie Kaplan]], ''From Krakow to Krypton : Jews And Comic Books''. Philadelphia : Jewish Publication Society, 2008. {{ISBN|9780827610439}} (p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Kane]]'s drawing of [[Batman]] on the cover of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' No. 27 (the first appearance of the character) was based on a 1937 Alex Raymond drawing of Flash Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;Arlen Schumer, ''Comic Book Artist/Alter-Ego'' Vol.1 No. 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Neville]] modeled the comics hero [[Hawkman]]'s costume on the &quot;Hawkmen&quot; characters in Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Plowright]], ''The Slings and Arrows Comic Guide'' Great Britain : Slings &amp; Arrows,2003 {{ISBN|0954458907}} (p. 246).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', [[Iron Man]] mockingly refers to [[Star-Lord]] as Flash Gordon due to their similar appearance and both being space heroes.

==Films==
Most of the Flash Gordon film and television adaptations retell the early adventures on the planet Mongo.

===Film serials===
{{Main|Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars|Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe}}
Flash Gordon was featured in three [[serial film]]s starring [[Buster Crabbe]]: ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1936), ''[[Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars]]'' (1938), and ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' (1940). The 1936 ''Flash Gordon'' serial was condensed into a feature-length film titled ''Flash Gordon'' or ''Rocket Ship'' or ''Space Soldiers'' or ''Flash Gordon: Spaceship to the Unknown'';&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|27624}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1938 serial into a feature-length film entitled ''Flash Gordon: The Deadly Ray from Mars;'' and the 1940 serial into a feature-length film entitled ''The Purple Death from Outer Space''.

The first Flash Gordon serial remains copyrighted, but the compilation made of the second serial, and the third serial itself are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75122/Rocket-Ship/notes.html https://books.google.com/books?id=dQIAoAGnKm0C&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Flash Gordon'' 1980 film===
{{Main|Flash Gordon (film)}}
In the 1970s, several noted directors attempted to make a film of the story. [[Federico Fellini]] optioned the ''Flash Gordon'' rights from [[Dino De Laurentiis]], but never made the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;sw&quot;&gt;[[Dale Pollock]], ''Skywalking : the life and films of George Lucas'' New York : Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0786749768}}, (p. 101)&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Lucas]] also attempted to make a ''Flash Gordon'' film in the 1970s. However, Lucas was unable to acquire the rights from De Laurentiis, so he decided to create ''[[Star Wars]]'' instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;sw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rm&quot;&gt;[[Ric Meyers]], ''S-F 2 : A Pictorial History of science fiction films from &quot;Rollerball&quot; to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;''. Secaucus, N.J. : Citadel Press,1984. {{ISBN|0806508752}} (pp. 167-8).&lt;/ref&gt; De Laurentiis then hired [[Nicolas Roeg]] to make a ''Flash Gordon'' film. However, De Laurentiis was unhappy with Roeg's ideas, and Roeg left the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;rm&quot;/&gt; De Laurentiis also discussed hiring [[Sergio Leone]] to helm the ''Flash Gordon'' film; Leone declined because he believed the script was not faithful to the original Raymond comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Frayling]], ''Sergio Leone : Something To Do With Death''.London, Faber and Faber, 2000. {{ISBN|0571164382}} (pp. 6, 377)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carlson, ''Sergio Leone''. Harpenden : Pocket Essentials, 2001. {{ISBN|9781903047415}} (p.22)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, De Laurentiis hired [[Mike Hodges]] to direct the ''Flash Gordon'' film.&lt;ref name=&quot;rm&quot;/&gt;

Riding the coattails of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', ''Flash Gordon'' was not a critical success on release. [[Melody Anderson]] co-starred with Jones as Dale Arden, alongside [[Chaim Topol]] as Dr. Hans Zarkov, [[Max von Sydow]] as Ming, [[Timothy Dalton]] as Prince Barin, [[Brian Blessed]] as Prince Vultan, [[Peter Wyngarde]] as Klytus and [[Ornella Muti]] as Princess Aura. Produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], with ornate production designs and costumes by [[Danilo Donati]], the bright colors and retro effects were inspired directly by the comic strip and 1930s serials.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCT&quot;/&gt;

[[Brian Blessed]]'s performance as the Hawkman leader [[Prince Vultan]] lodged the veteran stage and screen actor into the collective consciousness for the utterance of a single line&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; &quot;GORDON'S ALIVE?!&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which, more than 30 years later, remained the most repeated, reused, and recycled quotation from both the film and Blessed's career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2207279 &quot;Brian Blessed&quot; at the BBC's H2G2].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of menopause (vector).svg|thumb|300px|Symptoms of menopause]]
During early menopause transition, the [[menstrual cycles]] remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen. Hormone levels begin to fluctuate. Ovulation may not occur with each cycle.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;

The term ''menopause'' refers to a point in time that follows one year after the last menstruation.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams Gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727|pages=555–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the menopausal transition and after menopause, women can experience a wide range of symptoms.

===Vagina and uterus===
During the transition to menopause, [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual patterns]] can show shorter cycling (by 2–7 days);&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; longer cycles remain possible.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; There may be [[Irregular menstruation|irregular bleeding]] (lighter, heavier, spotting).&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore ([[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The [[European Menopause and Andropause Society]] has released guidelines for assessment of the [[endometrium]], which is usually the main source of spotting or bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23619009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreisler E, Poulsen LG, Antonsen SL, Ceausu I, Depypere H, Erel CT, Lambrinoudaki I, Pérez-López FR, Simoncini T, Tremollieres F, Rees M, Ulrich LG | title = EMAS clinical guide: assessment of the endometrium in peri and postmenopausal women | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23619009 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-menopausal women, however, any genital [[bleeding]] is an alarming symptom that requires an appropriate study to rule out the possibility of malignant diseases.

Symptoms that may appear during menopause and continue through postmenopause include:
*[[Dyspareunia|painful intercourse]]&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;
*[[vaginal dryness]]&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;
* [[atrophic vaginitis]] – thinning of the membranes of the [[vulva]], the [[vagina]], the [[cervix]], and the outer [[urinary tract]], along with considerable shrinking and loss in elasticity of all of the outer and inner genital areas.

==Causes==

Menopause can be induced or occur naturally. Induced menopause occurs as a result of medical treatment such as [[chemotherapy]], [[radiotherapy]], [[oophorectomy]], or complications of [[tubal ligation]], [[hysterectomy]], unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or [[leuprorelin]] usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/Dossier/MotherChild/gynae_problems/menopausal.html|title=Gynaecologic Problems: Menopausal Problems|publisher=Health on the Net Foundation|access-date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age.&lt;ref name=Tak2015/&gt; Half of women have their last period between the ages of 47 and 55, while 80% have their last period between 44 and 58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morabia A, Costanza MC | title = International variability in ages at menarche, first livebirth, and menopause.

In [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], the median age of natural menopause is considerably earlier, at 44 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ringa V |year=2000 |title=Menopause and treatments |journal=Quality of Life Research |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=695–707 |doi=10.1023/A:1008913605129 |jstor=4036942 |s2cid=22496307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 7 years (sometimes as long as 14 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH2013Def&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIA2017/&gt;

In rare cases, a woman's ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of [[puberty]] to age 40. This is known as [[premature ovarian failure]] and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Podfigurna-Stopa A, Czyzyk A, Grymowicz M, Smolarczyk R, Katulski K, Czajkowski K, Meczekalski B | title = Premature ovarian insufficiency: the context of long-term effects | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]] | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 983–90 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27091671 | pmc = 4987394 | doi = 10.1007/s40618-016-0467-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undiagnosed and untreated [[coeliac disease]] is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict [[gluten-free diet]] reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span.&lt;ref name=TersigniCastellani&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tersigni C, Castellani R, de Waure C, Fattorossi A, De Spirito M, Gasbarrini A, Scambia G, Di Simone N | title = Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 582–93 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24619876 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu007 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LasaZubiaurre&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasa JS, Zubiaurre I, Soifer LO | title = Risk of infertility in patients with celiac disease: a meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = Arquivos de Gastroenterologia | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 144–50 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25003268 | doi = 10.1590/S0004-28032014000200014 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have undergone [[hysterectomy]] with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 3.7 years earlier than the expected age. Other factors that can promote an earlier onset of menopause (usually 1 to 3 years early) are smoking cigarettes or being extremely thin.&lt;ref name=&quot;What causes early menopause&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Healthline|title=What causes early menopause|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/causes-early|publisher=Healthline|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928065554/http://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/causes-early|archive-date=28 September 2013|df=dmy-all|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premature ovarian failure===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF) is when the ovaries stop functioning before the age of 40 years.&lt;ref name=Laissue2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laissue P | title = Aetiological coding sequence variants in non-syndromic premature ovarian failure: From genetic linkage analysis to next generation sequencing | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 411 | pages = 243–57 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25960166 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2015.05.005 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=-Fenton2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton AJ | title = Premature ovarian insufficiency: Pathogenesis and management | journal = Journal of Mid-Life Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 147–53 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26903753 | pmc = 4743275 | doi = 10.4103/0976-7800.172292 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalantaridou SN 1006&quot;/&gt;

Known causes of premature ovarian failure include [[autoimmune disorder]]s, [[thyroid]] disease, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chemotherapy]], being a carrier of the [[fragile X syndrome]] gene, and [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref name=-Fenton2015 /&gt; However, in about 50–80% of spontaneous cases of premature ovarian failure, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally [[idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=Laissue2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalantaridou SN 1006&quot;&gt;Kalantaridou SN, Davis SR, Nelson LM. ''Endocrinology Metabolism Clinics of North America'', December 1998; 27(4) 989–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have a functional disorder affecting the reproductive system (e.g., [[endometriosis]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], cancer of the reproductive organs) can go into menopause at a younger age than the normal timeframe. The functional disorders often significantly speed up the menopausal process.

An early menopause can be related to [[cigarette]] smoking, higher [[body mass index]], racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the [[Oophorectomy|surgical removal of the ovaries]], with or without the removal of the uterus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucher, et al. 1930&quot;&gt;Bucher, et al. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of premature menopause have been found to be significantly higher in fraternal and identical [[twins]]; approximately 5% of twins reach menopause before the age of 40. The reasons for this are not completely understood. Transplants of ovarian tissue between identical twins have been successful in restoring fertility.

===Surgical menopause===

Menopause can be surgically induced by bilateral [[oophorectomy]] (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the Fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy).&lt;ref name=&quot;STRAW&quot;/&gt; Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called &quot;surgical menopause&quot;. Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether.&lt;ref name = &quot;Womenshealth.gov&quot; /&gt; The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels usually produces extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe.&lt;ref name = &quot;Womenshealth.gov&quot; /&gt;

Removal of the uterus ''without'' removal of the ovaries does ''not'' directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones.&lt;ref name = &quot;Womenshealth.gov&quot; /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:615 Age and Bone Mass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Bone loss due to menopause occurs due to changes in a woman's hormone levels.]]
The menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of [[oocytes]] ([[ovarian reserve]]). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as [[hysterectomy]] (with and without [[ovariectomy]]), [[endometrial ablation]] and [[uterine artery embolisation]]. The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels because there are fewer [[oocyte]]s and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen.

The transition has a variable degree of effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LS, Soares CN, Vitonis AF, Otto MW, Harlow BL | title = Risk for new onset of depression during the menopausal transition: the Harvard study of moods and cycles | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–90 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16585467 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.63.4.385 | series = The Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soules MR, Sherman S, Parrott E, Rebar R, Santoro N, Utian W, Woods N | title = Executive summary: Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) | journal = Climacteric | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 267–72 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11770182 | doi = 10.1080/cmt.4.4.267.272 | s2cid = 28673617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In younger women, during a normal [[menstrual cycle]] the ovaries produce [[estradiol]], [[testosterone]] and [[progesterone]] in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), which are both produced by the [[pituitary gland]]. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), [[estradiol]] levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular.&lt;ref name=Prior_2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior JC | title = Perimenopause: the complex endocrinology of the menopausal transition | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 397–428 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9715373 | doi = 10.1210/edrv.19.4.0341 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by [[inhibin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burger HG | title = Diagnostic role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements during the menopausal transition--an analysis of FSH, oestradiol and inhibin | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–42 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8124478 | doi = 10.1530/eje.0.1300038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after [[hysterectomy]] is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.&lt;ref name=&quot;cite journal|pmid=12737673&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nahás E, Pontes A, Traiman P, NahásNeto J, Dalben I, De Luca L | title = Inhibin B and ovarian function after total abdominal hysterectomy in women of reproductive age | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–31 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12737673 | doi = 10.1080/713603218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cite journal|pmid=15661947&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petri Nahás EA, Pontes A, Nahas-Neto J, Borges VT, Dias R, Traiman P | title = Effect of total abdominal hysterectomy on ovarian blood supply in women of reproductive age | journal = Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–74 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15661947 | doi = 10.7863/jum.2005.24.2.169 | s2cid = 30259666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are ''not'' considered to be reliable guides to a woman's exact menopausal status.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Menopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by [[aromatase]] in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson ER, Davis SR | title = Minireview: aromatase and the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis--some new perspectives | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 142 | issue = 11 | pages = 4589–94 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11606422 | doi = 10.1210/en.142.11.4589 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.

In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEAS) and [[androstenedione]] appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating [[androgen]] levels has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison SL, Bell R, Donath S, Montalto JG, Davis SR | title = Androgen levels in adult females: changes with age, menopause, and oophorectomy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 90 | issue = 7 | pages = 3847–53 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15827095 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-0212 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ovarian Androgen Production in Postmenopausal Women&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fogle RH, Stanczyk FZ, Zhang X, Paulson RJ | title = Ovarian androgen production in postmenopausal women | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 92 | issue = 8 | pages = 3040–3 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17519304 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2007-0581 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue to claim that hot flashes during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935, and, in most cases, hot flashes are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate hypothalamic dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early perimenopause and late menopausal transition and it is possible that they are caused by a different mechanism.&lt;ref name=Prior_2013 /&gt;

Long-term effects of menopause may include [[osteoporosis]], [[vaginal atrophy]] as well as changed metabolic profile resulting in cardiac risks.

===Ovarian aging===
Decreased inhibin feedback after [[hysterectomy]] is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after [[endometrial ablation]]. While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the [[endometrium]] may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of these factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and [[uterine artery embolisation]] has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;cite journal|pmid=12737673&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cite journal|pmid=15661947&quot;/&gt;

Impaired [[DNA]] repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging.&lt;ref name=Titus&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Titus S, Li F, Stobezki R, Akula K, Unsal E, Jeong K, Dickler M, Robson M, Moy F, Goswami S, Oktay K | title = Impairment of BRCA1-related DNA double-strand break repair leads to ovarian aging in mice and humans | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 172 | pages = 172ra21 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23408054 | pmc = 5130338 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called &quot;[[homologous recombination]]al repair&quot;, and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandl E, Mirzaghaderi G | title = The evolution of meiotic sex and its alternatives

Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see [[Oogenesis]]). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes.&lt;ref name=Titus /&gt; This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.

===Premenopause===

During perimenopause, [[estrogen]] levels average about 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cemcor&quot; /&gt; These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1–2 years of perimenopause (before menopause).&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chichester M, Ciranni P | title = Approaching menopause (but not there yet!): caring for women in midlife | journal = Nursing for Women's Health | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–4 | date = August–September 2011 | pmid = 21884497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-486X.2011.01652.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes are [[hot flash]]es, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, [[vaginal dryness]] or [[vaginal atrophy|atrophy]], [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]], [[osteoporosis]], and heart disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;cemcor&quot; /&gt; During this period, [[fertility]] diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause.

In some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often occurs when other stressors may be present in a woman's life:

* Caring for, and/or the death of, elderly parents
* [[Empty nest syndrome]] when children leave home
* The birth of grandchildren, which places people of &quot;middle age&quot; into a new category of &quot;older people&quot; (especially in cultures where being older is a state that is looked down on)

Some research appears to show that [[melatonin]] supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause.&lt;ref name=Bellipanni_2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellipanni G, DI Marzo F, Blasi F, Di Marzo A | title = Effects of melatonin in perimenopausal and menopausal women: our personal experience | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1057 | issue = 1 | pages = 393–402 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16399909 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1356.030 | bibcode = 2005NYASA1057..393B | s2cid = 25213110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmenopause===
The term &quot;postmenopausal&quot; describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a [[uterus]] and are not pregnant or [[Lactation|lactating]].&lt;ref name=&quot;STRAW&quot;/&gt; In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can be identified by a blood test showing a very high FSH level. Thus postmenopause is the time in a woman's life that takes place after her last period or, more accurately, after the point when her ovaries become inactive.

The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is because periods are usually erratic at this time of life. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.

A woman's reproductive hormone levels continue to drop and fluctuate for some time into post-menopause, so hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes may take several years to disappear.

A period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of [[endometrial cancer]].

==Management==
Perimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.

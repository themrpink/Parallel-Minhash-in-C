===Markov processes and chains===
{{Main|Markov process}}
Markov processes are stochastic processes, traditionally in [[Discrete time and continuous time|discrete or continuous time]], that have the Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process. In other words, the behavior of the process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the current state of the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serfozo2009page2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Serfozo|title=Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-89332-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rozanov2012page58&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Y.A.

===Martingale===
{{Main|Martingale (probability theory)}}
A martingale is a discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic process with the property that, at every instant, given the current value and all the past values of the process, the conditional expectation of every future value is equal to the current value. In discrete time, if this property holds for the next value, then it holds for all future values. The exact mathematical definition of a martingale requires two other conditions coupled with the mathematical concept of a filtration, which is related to the intuition of increasing available information as time passes. Martingales are usually defined to be real-valued,&lt;ref name=&quot;Klebaner2005page65&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fima C.

A symmetric random walk and a Wiener process (with zero drift) are both examples of martingales, respectively, in discrete and continuous time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klebaner2005page65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KaratzasShreve2014page11&quot;/&gt; For a [[sequence]] of [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots&lt;/math&gt; with zero mean, the stochastic process formed from the successive partial sums &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_1+ X_2, X_1+ X_2+X_3, \dots&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete-time martingale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele2012page12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Martingales can also be created from stochastic processes by applying some suitable transformations, which is the case for the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the ''compensated Poisson process''.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaratzasShreve2014page11&quot;/&gt; Martingales can also be built from other martingales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele2012page12&quot;/&gt; For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klebaner2005page65&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele2012page115&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

are all independent of each other, and the distribution of each increment only depends on the difference in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Applebaum2004page1337&quot;/&gt;

A Lévy process can be defined such that its state space is some abstract mathematical space, such as a [[Banach space]], but the processes are often defined so that they take values in Euclidean space. The index set is the non-negative numbers, so &lt;math&gt; I= [0,\infty) &lt;/math&gt;, which gives the interpretation of time. Important stochastic processes such as the Wiener process, the homogeneous Poisson process (in one dimension), and [[subordinator (mathematics)|subordinators]] are all Lévy processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Applebaum2004page1337&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoin1998pageVIII&quot;/&gt;

===Random field===
{{Main|Random field}}
A random field is a collection of random variables indexed by a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space or some manifold. In general, a random field can be considered an example of a stochastic or random process, where the index set is not necessarily a subset of the real line.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdlerTaylor2009page7&quot;/&gt; But there is a convention that an indexed collection of random variables is called a random field when the index has two or more dimensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GikhmanSkorokhod1969page1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamperti1977page1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KoralovSinai2007page171&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonid Koralov|author2=Yakov G.

===Point process===
{{Main|Point process}}
A point process is a collection of points randomly located on some mathematical space such as the real line, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space, or more abstract spaces. Sometimes the term ''point process'' is not preferred, as historically the word ''process'' denoted an evolution of some system in time, so a point process is also called a '''random point field'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiuStoyan2013page109&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sung Nok Chiu|author2=Dietrich Stoyan|author3=Wilfrid S.

===Statistical mechanics===
In the physical sciences, scientists developed in the 19th century the discipline of [[statistical mechanics]], where physical systems, such as containers filled with gases, can be regarded or treated mathematically as collections of many moving particles. Although there were attempts to incorporate randomness into statistical physics by some scientists, such as [[Rudolf Clausius]], most of the work had little or no randomness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truesdell1975page22&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Truesdell|first1=C.|title=Early kinetic theories of gases|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=15|issue=1|year=1975|pages=22–23|issn=0003-9519|doi=10.1007/BF00327232|s2cid=189764116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brush1967page150&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=Stephen G.|title=Foundations of statistical mechanics 1845?1915|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=4|issue=3|year=1967|pages=150–151|issn=0003-9519|doi=10.1007/BF00412958|s2cid=120059181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This changed in 1859 when [[James Clerk Maxwell]] contributed significantly to the field, more specifically, to the kinetic theory of gases, by presenting work where he assumed the gas particles move in random directions at random velocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truesdell1975page31&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Truesdell|first1=C.|title=Early kinetic theories of gases|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=15|issue=1|year=1975|pages=31–32|issn=0003-9519|doi=10.1007/BF00327232|s2cid=189764116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brush1958&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=S.G.|title=The development of the kinetic theory of gases IV.

===Measure theory and probability theory===
At the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Paris]] in 1900, [[David Hilbert]] presented a list of [[Hilbert's problems|mathematical problems]], where his sixth problem asked for a mathematical treatment of physics and probability involving [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham2000&quot;/&gt; Around the start of the 20th century, mathematicians developed measure theory, a branch of mathematics for studying integrals of mathematical functions, where two of the founders were French mathematicians, [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Émile Borel]]. In 1925 another French mathematician [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] published the first probability book that used ideas from measure theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham2000&quot;/&gt;

In 1920s fundamental contributions to probability theory were made in the Soviet Union by mathematicians such as [[Sergei Bernstein]], [[Aleksandr Khinchin]],{{efn|The name Khinchin is also written in (or transliterated into) English as Khintchine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doob1934&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doob|first1=Joseph|title=Stochastic Processes and Statistics|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=20|issue=6|year=1934|pages=376–379|doi=10.1073/pnas.20.6.376|pmid=16587907|pmc=1076423|bibcode=1934PNAS...20..376D}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[Andrei Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt; Kolmogorov published in 1929 his first attempt at presenting a mathematical foundation, based on measure theory, for probability theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;KendallBatchelor1990page33&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendall|first1=D.

===Birth of modern probability theory===
In 1933 Andrei Kolmogorov published in German, his book on the foundations of probability theory titled ''Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung'',{{efn|Later translated into English and published in 1950 as Foundations of the Theory of Probability&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham2000&quot;/&gt;}} where Kolmogorov used measure theory to develop an axiomatic framework for probability theory. The publication of this book is now widely considered to be the birth of modern probability theory, when the theories of probability and stochastic processes became parts of mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt;

After the publication of Kolmogorov's book, further fundamental work on probability theory and stochastic processes was done by Khinchin and Kolmogorov as well as other mathematicians such as [[Joseph Doob]], [[William Feller]], [[Maurice Fréchet]], [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], [[Wolfgang Doeblin]], and [[Harald Cramér]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bingham2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt;
Decades later Cramér referred to the 1930s as the &quot;heroic period of mathematical probability theory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt; [[World War II]] greatly interrupted the development of probability theory, causing, for example, the migration of Feller from [[Sweden]] to the [[United States|United States of America]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt; and the death of Doeblin, considered now a pioneer in stochastic processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindvall1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindvall|first1=Torgny|title=W.

===Stochastic processes after World War II===
After World War II the study of probability theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with significant contributions made in many areas of probability and mathematics as well as the creation of new areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramer1976&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Paul-André|title=Stochastic Processes from 1950 to the Present|journal=Electronic Journal for History of Probability and Statistics|volume=5|issue=1|year=2009|pages=1–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1940s, [[Kiyosi Itô]] published papers developing the field of [[stochastic calculus]], which involves stochastic [[integrals]] and stochastic [[differential equations]] based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ito1998Prize&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kiyosi Itô receives Kyoto Prize|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=45|issue=8|year=1998|pages=981–982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also starting in the 1940s, connections were made between stochastic processes, particularly martingales, and the mathematical field of [[potential theory]], with early ideas by [[Shizuo Kakutani]] and then later work by Joseph Doob.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2009&quot;/&gt; Further work, considered pioneering, was done by [[Gilbert Hunt]] in the 1950s, connecting Markov processes and potential theory, which had a significant effect on the theory of Lévy processes and led to more interest in studying Markov processes with methods developed by Itô.&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertoin1998pageVIIIandIX&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Bertoin|title=Lévy Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftcsQgMp5cUC&amp;pg=PR8|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64632-1|page=viii and ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele2012page176&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

Techniques and theory were developed to study Markov processes and then applied to martingales. Conversely, methods from the theory of martingales were established to treat Markov processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2009&quot;/&gt;

Other fields of probability were developed and used to study stochastic processes, with one main approach being the theory of large deviations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer2009&quot;/&gt; The theory has many applications in statistical physics, among other fields, and has core ideas going back to at least the 1930s.

The theory of stochastic processes still continues to be a focus of research, with yearly international conferences on the topic of stochastic processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlathImkeller2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Applebaum2004page1336&quot;/&gt;

===Discoveries of specific stochastic processes===
Although Khinchin gave mathematical definitions of stochastic processes in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doob1934&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vere-Jones2006page4&quot;/&gt; specific stochastic processes had already been discovered in different settings, such as the Brownian motion process and the Poisson process.&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuttorpThorarinsdottir2012&quot;/&gt; Some families of stochastic processes such as point processes or renewal processes have long and complex histories, stretching back centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaleyVere-Jones2006chap1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.J.

====Bernoulli process====
The Bernoulli process, which can serve as a mathematical model for flipping a biased coin, is possibly the first stochastic process to have been studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Florescu2014page301&quot;/&gt; The process is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials,&lt;ref name=&quot;BertsekasTsitsiklis2002page273&quot;/&gt; which are named after [[Jackob Bernoulli]] who used them to study games of chance, including probability problems proposed and studied earlier by Christiaan Huygens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hald2005page226&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Hald|title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOQy6-qnVx8C|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72517-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernoulli's work, including the Bernoulli process, were published in his book ''Ars Conjectandi'' in 1713.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lebowitz1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Louis Lebowitz|title=Nonequilibrium phenomena II: from stochastics to hydrodynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8IRAQAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=North-Holland Pub.|isbn=978-0-444-86806-0|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Random walks====
In 1905 [[Karl Pearson]] coined the term ''random walk'' while posing a problem describing a random walk on the plane, which was motivated by an application in biology, but such problems involving random walks had already been studied in other fields. Certain gambling problems that were studied centuries earlier can be considered as problems involving random walks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss2006page1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lebowitz1984&quot;/&gt; For example, the problem known as the ''Gambler's ruin'' is based on a simple random walk,&lt;ref name=&quot;KarlinTaylor2012page49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Florescu2014page374&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ionut Florescu|title=Probability and Stochastic Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5xEBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR22|year=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-59320-2|pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an example of a random walk with absorbing barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seneta2006page1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibe2013page5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver C.

For random walks in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional integer [[Lattice (group)|lattices]], [[George Pólya]] published in 1919 and 1921 work, where he studied the probability of a symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Florescu2014page385&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ionut Florescu|title=Probability and Stochastic Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5xEBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR22|year=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-59320-2|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes1995page111&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry D.

====Wiener process====
The [[Wiener process]] or Brownian motion process has its origins in different fields including statistics, finance and physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt; In 1880, [[Thorvald Thiele]] wrote a paper on the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiele1880&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thiele|first1=Thorwald N.|title=Om Anvendelse af mindste Kvadraterbs Methode i nogle Tilfælde, hvoren Komplikation af visse Slags uensartede tilfældige Fejlkilder giver Fejleneen &quot;systematisk&quot; Karakter|journal=Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Skrifter |volume=Series 5|issue=12|year=1880|pages=381–408|url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/43213604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hald1981page1and18&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hald|first1=Anders |title=T.

It is thought that the ideas in Thiele's paper were too advanced to have been understood by the broader mathematical and statistical community at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lauritzen1981page319&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wiener Zurich1932.tif|thumb|200px|[[Norbert Wiener]] gave the first mathematical proof of the existence of the Wiener process. This mathematical object had appeared previously in the work of [[Thorvald Thiele]], [[Louis Bachelier]], and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt;   ]]

The French mathematician [[Louis Bachelier]] used a Wiener process in his 1900 thesis&lt;ref name=Bachelier1900a&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bachelier |first=Luis |year=1900 |title=Théorie de la spéculation |journal=[[Ann.

It is commonly thought that Bachelier's work gained little attention and was forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered in the 1950s by the [[Leonard Savage]], and then become more popular after Bachelier's thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was never forgotten in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jovanovic2012&quot;/&gt; which was cited by mathematicians including Doob, Feller&lt;ref name=&quot;Jovanovic2012&quot;/&gt; and Kolmogorov.&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt; The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jovanovic2012&quot;/&gt;

In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] published a paper where he studied the physical observation of Brownian motion or movement to explain the seemingly random movements of particles in liquids by using ideas from the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. Einstein derived a [[differential equation]], known as a [[diffusion equation]], for describing the probability of finding a particle in a certain region of space. Shortly after Einstein's first paper on Brownian movement, [[Marian Smoluchowski]] published work where he cited Einstein, but wrote that he had independently derived the equivalent results by using a different method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brush1968page25&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=Stephen G.|title=A history of random processes|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=5|issue=1|year=1968|page=25|issn=0003-9519|doi=10.1007/BF00328110|s2cid=117623580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein's work, as well as experimental results obtained by [[Jean Perrin]], later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s&lt;ref name=&quot;Brush1968page30&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=Stephen G.|title=A history of random processes|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|volume=5|issue=1|year=1968|pages=1–36|issn=0003-9519|doi=10.1007/BF00328110|s2cid=117623580}}&lt;/ref&gt; to use a type of measure theory, developed by [[Percy Daniell]], and Fourier analysis to prove the existence of the Wiener process as a mathematical object.&lt;ref name=&quot;JarrowProtter2004&quot;/&gt;

====Poisson process====
The Poisson process is named after [[Siméon Poisson]], due to its definition involving the [[Poisson distribution]], but Poisson never studied the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DaleyVere-Jones2006page8&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.J.

process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuttorpThorarinsdottir2012&quot;/&gt;
At the beginning of the 20th century the Poisson process would arise independently in different situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuttorpThorarinsdottir2012&quot;/&gt;
In Sweden 1903, [[Filip Lundberg]] published a [[thesis]] containing work, now considered fundamental and pioneering, where he proposed to model insurance claims with a homogeneous Poisson process.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmbrechtsFrey2001page367&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Embrechts|first1=Paul|title=Stochastic Processes: Theory and Methods|last2=Frey|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Furrer|first3=Hansjörg|chapter=Stochastic processes in insurance and finance|volume=19|year=2001|page=367|issn=0169-7161|doi=10.1016/S0169-7161(01)19014-0|series=Handbook of Statistics|isbn=978-0444500144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cramér1969&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cramér|first1=Harald|title=Historical review of Filip Lundberg's works on risk theory|journal=Scandinavian Actuarial Journal|volume=1969|issue=sup3|year=1969|pages=6–12|issn=0346-1238|doi=10.1080/03461238.1969.10404602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another discovery occurred in [[Denmark]] in 1909 when [[A.K. Erlang]] derived the Poisson distribution when developing a mathematical model for the number of incoming phone calls in a finite time interval. Erlang was not at the time aware of Poisson's earlier work and assumed that the number phone calls arriving in each interval of time were independent to each other. He then found the limiting case, which is effectively recasting the Poisson distribution as a limit of the binomial distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt;

In 1910 [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Hans Geiger]] published experimental results on counting alpha particles. Motivated by their work, [[Harry Bateman]] studied the counting problem and derived Poisson probabilities as a solution to a family of differential equations, resulting in the independent discovery of the Poisson process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt; After this time there were many studies and applications of the Poisson process, but its early history is complicated, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and various physical scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirzaker2000&quot;/&gt;

====Markov processes====
Markov processes and Markov chains are named after [[Andrey Markov]] who studied Markov chains in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location= NJ|pages=2–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a [[weak law of large numbers]] without the independence assumption,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GrinsteadSnell1997page464&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Miller Grinstead|author2=James Laurie Snell|title=Introduction to Probability|url=https://archive.org/details/flooved3489|year=1997|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-0749-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flooved3489/page/n473 464]–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bremaud2013pageIX&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Bremaud|title=Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3124-8|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|title=First links in the Markov chain|journal=American Scientist|volume=101|issue=2|year=2013|pages=92–96|doi=10.1511/2013.101.92}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes2013&quot;/&gt; Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in [[Eugene Onegin]], written by [[Alexander Pushkin]], and proved a [[central limit theorem]] for such chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GrinsteadSnell1997page464&quot;/&gt;

In 1912 Poincaré studied Markov chains on [[finite group]]s with an aim to study card shuffling. Other early uses of Markov chains include a diffusion model, introduced by [[Paul Ehrenfest|Paul]] and [[Tatyana Ehrenfest]] in 1907, and a branching process, introduced by [[Francis Galton]] and [[Henry William Watson]] in 1873, preceding the work of Markov.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrinsteadSnell1997page464&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bremaud2013pageIX&quot;/&gt; After the work of Galton and Watson, it was later revealed that their branching process had been independently discovered and studied around three decades earlier by [[Irénée-Jules Bienaymé]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seneta1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seneta|first1=E.|title=I.J.

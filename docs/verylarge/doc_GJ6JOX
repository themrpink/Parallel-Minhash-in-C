{{wide image|East Amman panorama.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of east Amman from atop the [[Amman Citadel]] overlooking the Roman theater.}}

[[Downtown Amman]], the city centre area (known in Arabic as ''Al-Balad''), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. [[Jabal Amman]] is a well-known touristic attraction in old Amman, where the city's greatest souks, fine museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous [[Rainbow Street]] and the cultural [[Souk Jara]] market. [[File:East-Amman-Slums.jpg|thumb|A view of an East Amman slum]]

===Cuisine===
{{See also|Jordanian cuisine}}

Danielle Pergament of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines &quot;the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbour, Iraq. It's known as the food of the [[Levant]]&amp;nbsp;– an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Cuisiiine&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/travel/13choicetables.html| last= Pergament | first= Danielle | title= All the Foods of the Mideast at Its Stable Center |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amman's Street Food&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://beamman.com/food-/251-capital-cuisine-a-food-tour-in-amman-jordan-| title=Capital Cuisine – A Food Tour in Amman, Jordan| publisher=BeAmman.com| work=BeAmman.com| accessdate=2015-09-26| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926043547/http://beamman.com/food-/251-capital-cuisine-a-food-tour-in-amman-jordan-| archivedate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Alia International Airport is the major [[international airport]] in Jordan and the [[airline hub|hub]] for [[Royal Jordanian]], the [[flag carrier]]. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16&amp;nbsp;million passengers annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.albawaba.com/accelerating-passenger-growth-jordan%E2%80%99s-qaia-suggests-confidence-returning-386395| title=Accelerating passenger growth at Jordan's QAIA suggests confidence returning |website=Al Bawaba |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the [[Middle East]]' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by [[List of Airport Service Quality Award winners|Airport Service Quality]] Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aig.aero/en/content/1st-place-service-quality-rankings-qaia-named-best-airport-region-middle-east-and-best| accessdate=2015-09-23| title=1st Place Service Quality Rankings: QAIA Named 'Best Airport by Region – Middle East' and 'Best Improvement by Region – Middle East'| date=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
{{see also|List of roads in Amman}}

Amman has an extensive road network, although the mountainous terrain of the area has prevented the connection of some main roads, which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels. The [[Abdoun Bridge]] spans [[Wadi Abdoun]] and connects the [[List of roads in Amman#Circles|4th Circle]] to [[Abdoun Circle]]. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Tourism in Amman| accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Abdoun Bridge (7).jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdoun Bridge]], considered one of Amman's landmarks]]

There are eight circles, or [[roundabout]]s, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of immigrants to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighbourhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-residents-complain-about-daylong-car-jams| title=Amman residents complain about daylong car jams| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2014-06-08| publisher=The Jordan News| work=[[The Jordan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/gam-closes-princess-basma-street-brt-work| title=GAM closes Princess Basma street for BRT work| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-07-04| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a [[ring road]] encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/pm-inaugurates-second-phase-amman-road-project| title=PM inaugurates second phase of Amman road project| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2012-02-05| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104750/http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/pm-inaugurates-second-phase-amman-road-project| archivedate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus and taxi===
[[File:Bus.JPG|thumb|right|Public transport buses in Amman]]

The city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighbouring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the [[King Abdullah I Mosque|King Abdullah Mosque]], the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]] and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://studiesabroad.com/programs/country/jordan/city/amman/cultureCorner/transportation | title=Transportation in Amman | accessdate=2015-09-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925105718/http://studiesabroad.com/programs/country/jordan/city/amman/cultureCorner/transportation | archive-date=2015-09-25 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus rapid transit===
{{Main|Amman Bus Rapid Transit}}

Under construction are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate as part of the new urban rapid transit network ([[bus rapid transit]]). The system includes stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.business.jo/brt-project-on-track-gam/ |title=BRT project on track&amp;nbsp;– GAM &amp;#124; Jordan Business News &amp;#124; Amman Social Business Events &amp;#124; Press Release &amp; opinions |publisher=English.business.jo |accessdate=2012-11-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511140223/http://english.business.jo/brt-project-on-track-gam/ |archivedate=2013-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground station at the [[University of Jordan]]. The second corridor connects Sport City with [[Downtown Amman]] at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830223758/http://www.ammanbrt.jo/maps.asp |archivedate=2010-08-30 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Isra University.JPG|thumb|right|[[Al-Isra University]] in Amman]]

Amman is a major regional centre of education. The Amman region hosts Jordan's highest concentration of education centers. There are 20 universities in Amman. The [[University of Jordan]] is the largest public university in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ju.edu.jo/Pages/AboutUJ/UJInBrief.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729011718/http://www.ju.edu.jo/Pages/AboutUJ/UJInBrief.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-29 |title=JU In Brief }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.awa2el.net/article.aspx?ArticleNo=880|language=Arabic|title=كشف بأسماء المدارس الخاصة في عمان|accessdate=2015-09-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923031734/http://site.awa2el.net/article.aspx?ArticleNo=880|archivedate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Amman Baccalaureate School]], [[Amman Academy]], [[Amman National School]], [[Modern American School (Jordan)|Modern American School]], [[International School of Choueifat]], [[American Community School in Amman]] and [[National Orthodox School]].[[File:University of Jordan Monuments and Buildings 114.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Jordan]] library]]

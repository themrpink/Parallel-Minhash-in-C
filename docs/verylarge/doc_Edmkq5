The Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatization. Air traffic control privatization has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada, a private nonprofit organization which has reduced costs and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape. This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage. It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology. Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crichton|first1=John|title=The NAV CANADA Model|journal=The Journal of Air Traffic Control|date=2015|volume=57|issue=2|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
An '''ecovillage'''  is a traditional or [[intentional community]] with the [[goal]] of becoming more socially, culturally, economically, and/or ecologically [[sustainability|sustainable]]. An ecovillage strives to produce the least possible negative impact on the natural environment through intentional physical design and resident behavior choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore its social and natural environments. Most range from a population of 50 to 250 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger. Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller sub-communities. Some ecovillages have grown through like-minded individuals, families, or other small groups—who are not members, at least at the outset—settling on the ecovillage's periphery and participating ''[[de facto]]'' in the community.

Ecovillagers are united by shared [[Ecology|ecological]], [[Triple bottom line|social-economic]] and [[Spiritual ecology|cultural-spiritual]] values.&lt;ref name = Redefining&gt;Van Schyndel Kasper, D. (2008). [http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her151/kasper.pdf &quot;Redefining Community in the Ecovillage.&quot;] ''Human Ecology Review'' '''15''':12–24. Retrieved on July 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Concretely, ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them.  Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful [[consumerism|consumerist]] lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, [[urban sprawl]], [[factory farming]], and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life.

Ecovillages offer small-scale communities with [[Low-impact development (UK)|minimal ecological impact]] or regenerative impacts as an alternative.  However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (''see'' [[Global Ecovillage Network]] for an example).  This model of [[collective action]] is similar to that of [[Ten Thousand Villages]], which supports the [[fair trade]] of goods worldwide.

==Definition==
In 1991, [[Robert Gilman]] set out a definition of an ecovillage that became standard for many years.  Gilman defined an ecovillage as a:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[[human-scale]] full-featured settlement in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world in a way that is supportive of healthy human development, and can be successfully continued into the indefinite future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Robert (Summer, 1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Gilman1.htm &quot;The Eco-village Challenge&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213201638/http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Gilman1.htm |date=2004-12-13 }}. ''In Context.'' Retrieved on: 2008-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kosha Joubert, Executive Director of the Global Ecovillage Network, more recently defined an ecovillage as an:

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;intentional, traditional; rural or urban community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes in all four dimensions of sustainability (social, culture, ecology and economy) to regenerate their social and natural environments.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGbuOBCGfmQ From Apartheid to Ecovillage, TEDX 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this view, ecovillages are seen as an ongoing process, rather than a particular outcome. They often start off with a focus on one of the four dimensions of sustainability, e.g. ecology, but evolve into holistic models for restoration. In this view, aiming for sustainability is not enough; it is vital to restore and regenerate the fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, economic and cultural.

Ecovillages have developed in recent years as technology has improved so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by Baydoun, M. 2013.

Generally, the ecovillage concept is not tied to specific sectarian (religious, political, corporate) organizations or belief systems not directly related to environmentalism, such as monasteries, cults, or communes.

==History==
The modern-day desire for community was notably characterized by the communal &quot;back to the land&quot; movement of the 1960s and 1970s through communities such as the earliest example that still survives, the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] co-founded in May 1973 by James Clement van Pelt in Tallahassee, Florida. In the same decades, the imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns, in particular automobile-enabled [[suburban sprawl]], was brought into focus by recurrent energy crises. The term &quot;eco-village&quot; was introduced by Georgia Tech Professor George Ramsey in a 1978 address, &quot;Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment&quot;, to the First World Energy Conference of the Association of Energy Engineers,&lt;ref&gt;George Ramsey, &quot;Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment&quot;, First World Energy Conference, Association of Energy Engineers, published in ''Energy Engineering Technology: Proceedings of the First World Energy Engineering Congress'', October 31-November 2, 1978 in Atlanta, Ga. (Fairmont Press, 1979), pp. 220–242. For the term &quot;eco-village&quot; itself, see pp. 229 and 239. http://www.villagehabitat.com/resources/papers/passive_energy.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219012822/http://www.villagehabitat.com/resources/papers/passive_energy.pdf |date=2013-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe small-scale, car-free, close-in developments, including suburban infill, arguing that &quot;the great energy waste in the United States is not in its technology; it is in its lifestyle and concept of living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment&quot;, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsey's article includes a sketch for a &quot;self-sufficient pedestrian solar village&quot; by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today.

The movement became more focused and organized in the [[cohousing]] and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s. Then, in 1991, [[Robert Gilman]] and [[Diane Gilman]] co-authored a germinal study called &quot;Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities&quot; for Gaia Trust, in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together.

The first Eco-Village in North America began its first stages in 1990. Earthaven Eco-Village in Black Mountain, NC was the first community called an Eco-Village and was designed using permaculture (holistic) principles. The first residents moved onto the vacant land in 1993. As of 2019 Earthaven Eco-Village has over 70 families living off the grid on 368 acres of land. 
The ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]], in Scotland, in 1995. The conference was called: &quot;Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities&quot;, and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants. According to [[Ross Jackson]], &quot;somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide. The word 'ecovillage'... thus became part of the language of the [[Cultural Creatives]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;Jackson, Ross (Summer, 2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120330153156/http://www.ross-jackson.com/rj/21987/41762/ &quot;The Ecovillage Movement.&quot;] ''Permaculture Magazine'' '''40'''. Retrieved on: 2011-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt; After that conference, many intentional communities, including Findhorn, began calling themselves &quot;ecovillages&quot;, giving birth to a new movement. The [[Global Ecovillage Network]], formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the Findhorn conference, crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world, who had with similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other. Gaia Trust, Denmark, agreed to fund the network for its first five years.&lt;ref name = Movement/&gt; Today, there are self-identified ecovillages in over 70 countries on six continents.&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;Taggart, Jonathan (Nov-Dec, 2009). [https://archive.today/20120713075004/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6685/is_5_35/ai_n39169482/?tag=content;col1 Inside an ecovillage]. bNet - CBS Interactive Business Network. Retrieved on: 2011-08-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1995 conference, a number of the early members of the Global Ecovillage Network have tried other approaches to ecovillage building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted. One of these with some degree of success is [[Living Villages]] and The Wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximised and residents have shared food growing areas, woodland and [[animal husbandry]] for greater sustainability.

The principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] settings, as well as to developing and developed countries. Advocates seek a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of [[voluntary simplicity]]) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or [[ecoregion]]. Many advocates also seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others, particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on [[organic farming]], [[permaculture]] and other approaches which promote [[ecosystem]] function and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/D09TheSigOfTheGEM.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512162136/http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/D09TheSigOfTheGEM.html |archivedate=2013-05-12 }} [[Ted Trainer]] on ecovillages.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability, such as permaculture design.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, David. [http://holmgren.com.au/product/essence-of-permaculture/ &quot;The Essence of Permaculture.&quot;] Retrieved on: 2013-07-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Dawson, former president of the Global Ecovillage Network, describes five ecovillage principles in his 2006 book ''Ecovillages: New Frontiers for Sustainability'':
# They are not government-sponsored projects, but grassroots initiatives.
# Their residents value and practice community living.
# Their residents are not overly dependent on government, corporate or other centralized sources for water, food, shelter, power and other basic necessities. Rather, they attempt to provide these resources themselves.
# Their residents have a strong sense of shared values, often characterized in spiritual terms.
# They often serve as research and demonstration sites, offering educational experiences for others.&lt;ref name = Inside/&gt;

==Governance==
Effective governance is important within Eco-villages. It provides a model to implement and promote sustainable lifestyles (Cunningham and Wearing, 2013). While the first generation of ecovillagers tended to adopt [[consensus decision-making]] as a governance method, some difficulties with consensus as an everyday decision-making method  emerged: it can be extremely time-intensive, and decisions too often could be blocked by a few intransigent members.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Leafe Christian, &quot;Busting-the-myth-that-consensus-with-unanimity-is-good-for-communities&quot;, http://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-03-20/busting-the-myth-that-consensus-with-unanimity-is-good-for-communities-part-ii&lt;/ref&gt; More recently many ecovillages have moved toward [[sociocracy]] and related alternative decision-making methods.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, John; Villines, Sharon (2007). We the People: Consenting to a Deeper Democracy (First edition, second printing with corrections ed.). Washington DC: Sociocracy.info Press. pp. 31, 39. {{ISBN|978-0-9792827-0-6}}(pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ecovillages look for alternative government with emphasis on deeper connections with ecology than economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ecovillages as an ecological alternative|url=https://www.iberdrola.com/environment/ecovillages-alternative-ecological-communities|access-date=2020-08-21|website=Iberdrola|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peres told Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] that he had been born as a result of a blessing his parents had received from a [[Rebbe|chassidic rebbe]] and that he was proud of it.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Telushkin.

HarperCollins, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Peres' grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Meltzer, a grandson of Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]], had a great impact on his life. In an interview, Peres said: &quot;As a child, I grew up in my grandfather's home. … I was educated by him. … My grandfather taught me [[Talmud]]. It was not as easy as it sounds.

In 1932, Peres' father immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and settled in [[Tel Aviv]]. The family followed him in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;achievement&quot; /&gt; He attended [[Gymnasia Balfour|Balfour]] Elementary School and High School, and Geula Gymnasium (High School for Commerce) in [[Tel Aviv]].

In 1941, he was elected Secretary of [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]], a [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] youth movement, and in 1944 returned to Alumot, where he had an agricultural training and worked as a farmer and a shepherd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHIMON PERES|url=http://www.peres-center.org/our_mission|access-date=September 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927214953/http://www.peres-center.org/our_mission|archive-date=September 27, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 20, he was elected to the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed national secretariat, where he was only one of two [[Mapai]] party supporters, out of the 12 members. Three years later, he took over the movement and won a majority. The head of Mapai, [[David Ben-Gurion]], and [[Berl Katznelson]] began to take an interest in him, and appointed him to Mapai's secretariat.&lt;ref name=seventy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.il/he/departments/president_of_the_state_of_israel|title=בית הנשיא|website=GOV.IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Peres led an illicit expedition into the [[Negev]], then a closed military zone requiring a permit to enter. The expedition, consisting of a group of teenagers, along with a [[Palmach]] scout, a zoologist, and an archaeologist, had been funded by Ben-Gurion and planned by Palmach head [[Yitzhak Sadeh]], as part of a plan for future Jewish settlement of the area so as to include it in the Jewish state.&lt;ref name = NYTdeath /&gt; The group was arrested by a [[Bedouin]] camel patrol led by a British officer, taken to [[Beersheba]] (then a small Arab town) and incarcerated in the local jail. All of the participants were sentenced to two weeks in prison, and as the leader, Peres was also heavily fined.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin: ''Israel: A History'' (Pages 116–117)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Peres' relatives who remained in Wiszniew in 1941 were murdered during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1145452.html|title=Peres to German MPs: Hunt down remaining Nazi war criminals|date=January 27, 2010|work=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them (including Rabbi Meltzer) burned alive in the town's synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2010/Address_President_Peres_German_Bundestag_27-Jan-2010.htm |title=Address by Peres to German Bundestag |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=January 27, 2010 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

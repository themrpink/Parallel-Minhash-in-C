The name ''Cloudina'' honors the 20th-century geologist and paleontologist [[Preston Cloud]].&lt;ref name=Description /&gt;

Cloudinids comprise two genera: ''Cloudina'' itself is mineralized, whereas ''Conotubus'' is at best weakly mineralized, whilst sharing the same &quot;funnel-in-funnel&quot; construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/G38157.1|title=The end of the Ediacaran: Two new exceptionally preserved body fossil assemblages from Mount Dunfee, Nevada, USA|journal=Geology|volume=44|issue=11|pages=911|year=2016|last1=Smith|first1=E.F.|last2=Nelson|first2=L.L.|last3=Strange|first3=M.A.|last4=Eyster|first4=A.E.|last5=Rowland|first5=S.M.|last6=Schrag|first6=D.P.|last7=MacDonald|first7=F.A.|bibcode=2016Geo....44..911S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloudinids had a wide geographic range, reflected in the present distribution of localities in which their fossils are found, and are an abundant component of some deposits. They never appear in the same layers as soft-bodied [[Ediacaran biota]], but the fact that some sequences contain cloudinids and Ediacaran biota in alternating layers suggests that these groups had different environmental preferences. It has been suggested that cloudinids lived embedded in [[microbial mat]]s, growing new cones to avoid being buried by silt. However no specimens have been found embedded in mats, and their mode of life is still an unresolved question.

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification]] of the cloudinids has proved difficult: they were initially regarded as [[polychaete]] worms, and then as coral-like [[cnidarian]]s on the basis of what look like [[Budding|buds]] on some specimens. Current scientific opinion is divided between classifying them as polychaetes and regarding it as unsafe to classify them as members of any broader grouping. In 2020, a new study of pyritized specimens from the [[Wood Canyon Formation]] in Nevada showed the presence of [[Nephrozoa|Nephrozoan]] type [[Gastrointestinal tract|guts]], the oldest on record, supporting the [[Bilateria|bilaterian]] interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20200110&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schiffbauer, James D. |display-authors=et al. |title=Discovery of bilaterian-type through-guts in cloudinomorphs from the terminal Ediacaran Period |date=10 January 2020 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=11 |number=205 |pages=205 |doi=10.1038/s41467-019-13882-z |pmid=31924764 |pmc=6954273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloudinids are important in the history of animal evolution for two reasons. They are among the earliest and most abundant of the [[small shelly fossils]] with [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralized]] [[skeleton]]s, and therefore feature in the debate about why such skeletons first appeared in the Late Ediacaran. The most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators, as some ''[[Cloudina]]'' specimens from China bear the marks of multiple attacks, which suggests they survived at least a few of them. The holes made by predators are approximately proportional to the size of the ''Cloudina'' specimens, and ''[[Sinotubulites]]'' fossils, which are often found in the same beds, have so far shown no such holes. These two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner, and the [[evolutionary arms race]] which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of the [[Cambrian explosion]] of animal [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and complexity.

&lt;!--   ******* No ref for this, can't find one The two species of ''Cloudina'' are only distinguished on the basis of diameter, and it is possible that they in fact represent male and female forms of the same species.********  --&gt;

==Ecology==
''Cloudina'' is usually found in association with microbial [[stromatolites]], which are limited to shallow water; their [[isotope analysis|isotopic composition]]&lt;ref&gt;Ca/Mg ratios&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that water temperatures were relatively cool. They have also been found in normal sea-floor sediments, suggesting that they were not only restricted to dwelling on microbial mounds.&lt;ref name=domke2009&gt;{{Walcott 2009|domke}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''Cloudina'' has never been found in the same layers as the soft-bodied [[Ediacara biota]], but ''Cloudina'' and Ediacara biota have been found in alternating layers. This suggests that the two groups of organisms had different environmental preferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;

In many ''Cloudina'' specimens the ridges formed by the cones are of varying width, which suggests the organisms grew at a variable rate. [[Adolf Seilacher]] suggests that they adhered to [[microbial mat]]s, and that the growth phases represented the organism keeping pace with sedimentation—growing through new material deposited on it that would otherwise bury it. Kinks in the developing tube are easily explained by the mat falling slightly from the horizontal.&lt;ref name=Seilacher1999&gt;{{cite journal

 | jstor = 3515363
| bibcode = 1999Palai..14...86S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its small size, ''Cloudina'' would be expected to be found ''in situ'' in the microbial mat, especially if, as Seilacher suggests, sedimentation built up around it during its lifetime.  But all the many specimens discovered to date have only been found having been washed out of their places of growth. A further argument against Seilacher's hypothesis is that the predatory borings found in many specimens are not concentrated at what would be the top end, as one would expect if the animal was mainly buried. An alternative is that the organism dwelt on seaweeds,&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{Cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but until a specimen unquestionably ''in situ'' is discovered, its mode of life remains open to debate.

The tubes often appear to form colonies, although they are sometimes found in more isolated situations. The frequent appearance of large and sometimes single-species colonies has been attributed to the lack of significant predation.&lt;ref name=Description /&gt; On the other hand, in some locations up to 20% of ''Cloudina'' fossils contain [[predator]]y borings ranging from 15 to 400&amp;nbsp;μm in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUA2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hua, H.|author2=Pratt, B.R.|author3=Zhang, L.U.Y.I.|year=2003|title=Borings in Cloudina Shells: Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics in the Terminal Neoproterozoic|journal=PALAIOS|volume=18|issue=4–5|pages=454|bibcode=2003Palai..18..454H|doi=10.1669/0883-1351(2003)018&lt;0454:BICSCP&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=0883-1351}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-04-24--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bengtson1992 /&gt; The boreholes are rather evenly distributed along the tube length, and some tubes had been bored multiple times—hence the organism could survive attacks, since predators do not attack empty shells. This may indicate that the animal could vary its position in the tube in response to predation, or that it occupied the full length—but not the full width—of the tube. The even distribution is perhaps difficult to reconcile with an [[infauna]]l lifestyle, mainly buried in a microbial mat, and adds weight to Miller's suggestion that the animal lived on seaweeds or in a reef environment. If modern-day molluscs are a suitable analogy, the size distribution of the borings suggests that the predator was similar in size to ''Cloudina''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brain2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brain, CK|year=2001|title=Some observations on Cloudina, a terminal Proterozoic index fossil from Namibia|url=|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|volume=33|issue=3|pages=475–480|bibcode=2001JAfES..33..475B|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)00083-5}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-04-24--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 This co-existence stands against [[Mark McMenamin]]'s hypothesis that the advent of skeletonisation caused the extinction of soft-bodied Ediacaran forms; however the disappearance of ''Cloudina'' at the [[Ediacaran]] - Cambrian boundary suggests that an [[extinction event]] may have occurred, which may have been related to the subsequent [[Cambrian explosion]] of life-forms. Although no Cloudinid body fossils have been found after the Ediacaran period, it has been suggested that the enigmatic trace fossils ''[[Salterella]]'' and ''[[Cornulites]]'' were formed by Cloudinids.  ********* --&gt;

'''Conodonts''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''kōnos'', &quot;[[cone]]&quot;, + ''odont'', &quot;[[tooth]]&quot;) are extinct [[agnatha]]n [[chordata|chordates]] resembling eels, classified in the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Conodonta'''.  For many years, they were known only from tooth-like microfossils found in isolation and now called '''conodont elements'''. Knowledge about soft tissues remains limited.  The animals are also called '''Conodontophora''' (conodont bearers) to avoid ambiguity.

Conodonts are considered [[index fossil]]s, fossils used to define and identify [[geological periods]].

== Geological history ==
The conodonts first appeared during the [[Cambrian Stage 2]] (also referred as Tommotian).&lt;ref&gt;Early Cambrian (Tommotian) conodonts and other shelly microfauna from the Upper Krol of Mussoorie Syncline. RJ Azmi, VP Pancholi, Lesser Himalaya, with remarks on the Precambrian, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
The still unnamed [[Cambrian Stage 10]] can be defined as the [[First appearance datum|first appearance]] of ''[[Eoconodontus notchpeakensis]]''. The upper boundary is defined as the appearance of ''[[Iapetognathus fluctivagus]]'' which marks the beginning of the [[Tremadocian]] and is radiometrically dated as 485.4 ± 1.9 million years ago.

The [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] occurred approximately 488 million years ago. This early Paleozoic extinction event extirpated many conodonts.

The [[Lau event]], about 420 million years ago, a relatively minor mass extinction during the Silurian period, had a major impact on conodont populations.

The [[Kačák Event]] was a period of significant extinctions. The group most affected was the [[Ammonoidea]], although there were also faunal turnovers amongst conodonts and [[Tentaculita|dacryoconarid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeSantis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeSantis|first=M.K.|author2=Brett C.E.|year=2011|title=Late Eifelian (Middle Devonian) biocrises: Timing and signature of the pre-Kačák Bakoven and Stony Hollow Events in eastern North America|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=304|issue=1&amp;ndash;2|pages=113–135|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire class is postulated to have been wiped out in the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], which occurred roughly 200 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/geo/16986180/articulos/JIGE9696120347A.PDF The extinction of conodonts —in terms of discrete elements— at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary]&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the [[Triassic]] deadly marine biocalcification began to occur, along with oceanic acidification, sea-level fluctuations and the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] (CAMP) releasing [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[aerosols]]. These environmental catastrophes caused the extinction of the conodonts, along with 34% of other marine genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Ryder |author2=David E. Fastovsky |author3=Stefan Gartner |title=The Cretaceous-Tertiary Event and Other Catastrophes in Earth History|date=1996|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=9780813723075|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAup0TOL09gC&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last conodont species to appear, ''Neohindeodella detrei'', existed at the very end of the [[Rhaetian]]. The youngest conodont specimen of this species was found in the earliest [[Hettangian]] of Hungary, when the final extinction of conodonts occurred.

==Discovery and understanding of conodonts==

Conodonts, that is, the teeth-like fossils, were first discovered by [[Heinz Christian Pander]], the results published, in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]], in 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.H. Pander's introduction to conodonts, 1856&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286568271 | title=C.H. Pander's introduction to conodonts, 1856 | date=December 2008 | accessdate=3 January 2019 |author1=Sweet, Walter C. |author2=Cooper, Barry J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''pander'' is commonly used in scientific names of conodonts.

It was only in the early 1980s that the first fossil evidence was found of the rest of the animal (see below). In the 1990s exquisite fossils were found in South Africa in which the soft tissue had been converted to clay, preserving even muscle fibres. The presence of muscles for rotating the eyes showed definitively that the animals were primitive vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Jan Zalasiewicz]] and [[Sarah Gabbott]] |title=The quick and the dead |journal=New Scientist |date=Jun 5, 1999 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221895-200-the-quick-and-the-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conodont [[tooth|teeth]] are the earliest found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name='Shubin &quot;Conodont&quot;'&gt;{{cite book|last=Shubin|first=Neil|title=Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5 Billion Year History of the Human Body|year=2009|edition=reprint|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=9780307277459|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of [[mineralized tissues]] has been puzzling for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of chordate tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of conodont or the dermal skeleton of early [[agnathans]].

The element array constituted a feeding apparatus that is radically different from the jaws of modern animals. They are now termed &quot;conodont elements&quot; to avoid confusion. The three forms of teeth, i.e., coniform cones, ramiform bars, and pectiniform platforms, probably performed different functions.

For many years, conodonts were known only from enigmatic tooth-like microfossils (200 micrometers to 5 millimeters in length&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MIRACLE|title=Conodonts|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/conodont.html|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which occur commonly, but not always in isolation, and were not associated with any other fossil. Until the early 1980s, conodont teeth had not been found in association with fossils of the host organism, in a [[lagerstätte|konservat lagerstätte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs-Lethaia&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Briggs | first1 = D.

They are widely [[conodont biostratigraphy|used in biostratigraphy]]. Conodont elements are also used as [[paleothermometer]]s, a proxy for thermal alteration in the host rock, because under higher temperatures, the phosphate undergoes predictable and permanent color changes, measured with the [[conodont alteration index]]. This has made them useful for [[petroleum exploration]] where they are known, in rocks dating from the [[Cambrian]] to the Late [[Triassic]].

[[File:Manticolepis subrecta.jpg|thumb|left|Model of elements of ''Manticolepis subrecta'' - a conodont from the Upper Frasnian of Poland - photography taken in the Geological Museum of the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw]]

==== Elements of ozarkodinids ====
The feeding apparatus of [[ozarkodinida|ozarkodinids]] is composed at the front of an axial Sa element, flanked by two groups of four close-set elongate Sb and Sc elements which were inclined obliquely inwards and forwards. Above these elements lay a pair of arched and inward pointing (makellate) M elements. Behind the S-M array lay transversely oriented and bilaterally opposed (pectiniform, i.e. comb-shaped) Pb and Pa elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=352| issue= 1361| pages =1545–1564|doi=10.1098/rstb.1997.0141|pmc=1692076| year= 1997| last1= Purnell| first1= M.

== Ecology ==
The &quot;teeth&quot; of some conodonts have been interpreted as filter-feeding apparatuses, filtering plankton from the water and passing it down the throat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  Others have been interpreted as a &quot;grasping and crushing array&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gabbott1995/&gt; The preserved musculature suggests that some conodonts (''Promissum'' at least) were efficient cruisers, but incapable of bursts of speed.&lt;ref name=Gabbott1995/&gt;

A study on the population dynamics of ''[[Alternognathus]]'' has been published. Among other things, it demonstrates that at least this taxon had short lifespans lasting around a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Świś | first1 = Przemysław | year = 2019 | title = Population dynamics of the Late Devonian conodont Alternognathus calibrated in days | url = | journal = Historical Biology: An International Journal of Paleobiology | volume =  | issue = | pages =  1–9| doi = 10.1080/08912963.2018.1427088 | s2cid = 89835464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this analysis comes with one caveat: early forms of conodonts, the [[protoconodont]]s, appear to form a distinct clade from the later '''paraconodonts''' and '''euconodonts'''.  Protoconodonts likely represent a stem group to the phylum that includes [[Chaetognatha|chaetognath]] worms; this conclusion suggests that chaetognaths are not close relatives of true conodonts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szaniawski2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Moreover, some analyses do not regard conodonts as either [[vertebrate]]s or [[Craniata|craniates]], because they lack the main characteristics of these groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&amp;al2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

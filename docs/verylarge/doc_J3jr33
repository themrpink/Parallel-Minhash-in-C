In 2008, high-speed trains began running at a top speed of {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on}} on the [[Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway]], which opened during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.
The following year, trains on the newly opened [[Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway]] set a world record for average speed over an entire trip, at {{convert|312.5|km/h|abbr=on}} over {{convert|968|km|abbr=off}}.

A [[Wenzhou train collision|collision of high-speed trains]] on 23 July 2011 in [[Zhejiang]] province killed 40 and injured 195, raising concerns about operational safety. A credit crunch later that year slowed the construction of new lines. In July 2011, top train speeds were lowered to {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}. But by 2012, the high-speed rail boom had renewed with new lines and new rolling stock by domestic producers that had indigenized foreign technology. On 26 December 2012, China opened the [[Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong high-speed railway]], the world's longest high-speed rail line, which runs {{convert|2208|km|abbr=on}} from [[Beijing West railway station]] to [[Shenzhen North Railway Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Jingshen HSR&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=World's Longest Fast Train Line Opens in China|work=Associated Press|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/worlds-longest-fast-train-line-opens-china|url-status=dead|accessdate=26 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229131846/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/worlds-longest-fast-train-line-opens-china|archive-date=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beijing – Guangzhou high speed line completed|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/beijing-guangzhou-high-speed-line-completed.html|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korean KTX====
[[File:KTX-Sancheon.jpg|thumb|The Korean-developed [[KTX Sancheon]]]]
In South Korea, [[Korea Train Express|Korea Train Express (KTX)]] services were launched on 1 April 2004, using French (TGV) technology, on the Seoul–Busan corridor, Korea's busiest traffic corridor, between the two largest cities. In 1982, it represented 65.8% of South Korea's population, a number that grew to 73.3% by 1995, along with 70% of freight traffic and 66% of passenger traffic. With both the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] and [[Korail]]'s [[Gyeongbu Line]] congested as of the late 1970s, the government saw the pressing need for another form of transportation.{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=11}}

Construction began on the high-speed line from [[Seoul]] to [[Busan]] in 1992 with the first commercial service launching in 2004. Top speed for trains in regular service is currently {{convert|305|km/h|abbr=on}}, though the infrastructure is designed for {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on}}. The initial rolling stock was based on [[Alstom]]'s [[SNCF TGV Réseau|TGV Réseau]], and was partly built in Korea. The domestically developed [[HSR-350x]], which achieved {{convert|352.4|km/h|abbr=on}} in tests, resulted in a second type of high-speed trains now operated by Korail, the [[KTX Sancheon]]. The next generation KTX train, [[HEMU-430X]], achieved {{convert|421.4|km/h|abbr=on}} in 2013, making South Korea the world's fourth country after France, Japan, and China to develop a high-speed train running on conventional rail above {{convert|420|km/h|abbr=on}}.

====Taiwan HSR====
[[File:THSR 700T Front view.jpg|thumb|Taiwan High Speed Rail, derived from the Shinkansen]]
[[Taiwan High Speed Rail]]'s first and only HSR line opened for service on 5 January 2007, using Japanese trains with a top speed of {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}. The service traverses {{convert|345|km|abbr=on}} from {{stl|Taiwan High Speed Rail|Nangang}} to {{stl|Taiwan High Speed Rail|Zuoying}} in as little as 105 minutes. Once THSR began operations, almost all passengers switched from airlines flying parallel routes&lt;ref name=&quot;railvsair_TJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chen |first=Melody |date=4 September 2008 |title=Romance of rail jeopardizes domestic air routes |journal=[[Taiwan Journal]] |url=http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/tj/ct.asp?CtNode=122&amp;xItem=45023 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925003521/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/tj/ct.asp?CtNode=122&amp;xItem=45023 |archive-date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while road traffic was also reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaWh_07&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=26 September 2007 |title=Taiwan's High-speed Rail: It's Been a Rapid Learning Curve |work=China Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] |url=http://www.knowledgeatwharton.com.cn/index.cfm?fa=viewfeature&amp;articleid=1718&amp;languageid=1 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East and Central Asia===
{{main|High-speed rail in Turkey|Haramain high-speed railway}}

====Turkey====
In 2009, Turkey inaugurated a high-speed service between Ankara and [[Eskișehir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://todayszaman.com/news-167998-high-speed-train-to-make-8-trips-daily-between-ankara-eskisehir.html |title=High-speed train to make 8 trips daily between Ankara, Eskișehir |work=TodaysZaman |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021053726/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-167998-high-speed-train-to-make-8-trips-daily-between-ankara-eskisehir.html |archive-date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been followed up by an [[Ankara]] – [[Konya]] route, and the Eskișehir line has been extended to [[Istanbul]] (Asian part).

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbekistan opened the [[Afrosiyob (train)|Afrosiyob]] {{convert|344|km|abbr=on}} service from [[Tashkent]] to [[Samarkand]] in 2011, which was upgraded in 2013 to an average operational speed of {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} and peak speed of {{convert|250|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Talgo 250 service has been extended to Karshi as of August 2015 whereby the train travels {{convert|450|km|abbr=on}} in 3 hours. As of August 2016, the train service was extended to [[Bukhara]], and the {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} extension will take 3 hours and 20 minutes down from 7 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/talgo-250-reaches-bukhara.html |title=Talgo 250 reaches Bukhara |first=DVV Media |last=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steigung NIM.jpg|thumb|A German high-speed line, with [[ballastless track]]]]

[[Continuous welded rail]] is generally used to reduce track vibrations and misalignment. Almost all high-speed lines are electrically driven via [[overhead line]]s, have [[in-cab signalling]], and use advanced switches using very low entry and [[Switch frog|frog]] angles.

====Road-rail parallel layout====
[[File:NIM Baustelle2001 Leidorf Koeschinger Forst.jpg|thumb|A German high-speed line being built along a highway]]

The road-rail parallel layout uses land beside highways for railway lines. Examples include Paris/Lyon and [[Köln–Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Köln–Frankfurt]] in which 15% and 70% of the track runs beside highways, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhcrawford.com/energy/interstaterail.html |title=Interstate Rail Proposal |publisher=J.H.

====Track sharing====
In China, high-speed lines at speeds between {{convert|200|and|250|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} may carry freight or passengers, while lines operating at speeds over {{cvt|300|km/h|mph|0}} are used only by passenger CRH trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/353fecc8-40e1-11df-94c2-00144feabdc0,dwp_uuid=9c33700c-4c86-11da-89df-0000779e2340.html|title=China on track to be world's biggest network|author=Jamil Anderlini|work=Financial Times|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[High Speed 1|HS1]] is also used by regional trains run by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] at speeds of up to 225&amp;nbsp;km/h, and occasionally freight trains that run to central Europe.

In Germany, some lines are shared with Inter-City and regional trains at day and freight trains at night.

In France, some lines are shared with regional trains that travel at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h, for example [[TER Pays de la Loire|TER Nantes-Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/200-km/h-dans-le-ter-inaugural-sur-la-ligne-grande-vitesse-video-5105752 | title=Nantes-Laval.

===Cost===
The cost per kilometre in Spain was estimated at between €9 million (Madrid-Andalucía) and €22 million (Madrid-Valladolid). 
In Italy, the cost was between €24 million (Roma-Napoli) and €68 million (Bologna-Firenze).&lt;ref&gt;https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/1015984/186783/Beria%20Bel%20et%20al%20-%20Mismatches%20HSR%20Italy%20n%20Spain%20-%20PAPER%2013%20%5BSENT%5D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 2010s, costs per kilometre in France ranged from €18 million (BLP Brittany) to €26 million (Sud Europe Atlantique).&lt;ref&gt;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/695111468024545450/pdf/892000BRI0Box3000china0transport09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimated in 2019 that the Chinese HSR network was built at an average cost of $17-$21 million per km, a third less of the cost in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/933411559841476316/pdf/Chinas-High-Speed-Rail-Development.pdf|title=China's High-Speed Rail Development|last=Lawrence, Martha, Richard Bullock, and Ziming Liu|date=2019|website=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freight high-speed rail ==
All high-speed trains have been designed to carry passengers only. There are very few high-speed freight services in the world; they all use trains which were originally designed to carry passengers.

During the planning of the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]], the [[Japanese National Railways]] were planning for freight services along the route. This plan was later discarded.

The French [[SNCF TGV La Poste|TGV La Poste]] was for a long time the sole very high-speed train service, transporting mail in France for [[La Poste (France)|La Poste]] at a maximum top speed of 270&amp;nbsp;km/h, between 1984 and 2015. The trainsets were either specifically adapted and built, either converted, passenger [[SNCF TGV Sud-Est|TGV Sud-Est]] trainsets.

In Italy, Mercitalia Fast is a high-speed freight service launched in October 2018 by [[Mercitalia]]. It uses converted passenger [[FS Class ETR 500|ETR 500]] trainsets to carry goods at average speeds of 180&amp;nbsp;km/h, at first between Caserta and Bologna, with plans to extend the network throughout Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsitaliane.it/content/fsitaliane/en/Media/press-releases-and-news/2018/4/6/mercitalia-fast--from-october--goods-will-travel-at-high-speed.html|title=Mercitalia Fast: from October, goods will travel at high speed|website=www.fsitaliane.it|access-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117233926/https://www.fsitaliane.it/content/fsitaliane/en/Media/press-releases-and-news/2018/4/6/mercitalia-fast--from-october--goods-will-travel-at-high-speed.html|archive-date=17 November 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, high-speed rail is integrated with [[courier]] services to provide fast door-to-door intercity deliveries. For example, China Railways has partnered with [[SF Express]] for high-speed cargo deliveries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-08-29/china-railway-corp-sf-express-team-up-on-delivery-venture-101320197.html|title=China Railway Corp., SF Express Team Up on Delivery Venture|author=Mo Yelin|date=29 August 2018|accessdate=22 September 2020|website=Caixin Global}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deutsche Bahn]] offers express deliveries within Germany as well as to some major cities outside the country on the ICE network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.time-matters.com/transport-solutions/ickurier/|title=ic:kurier: Rail courier service by train|accessdate=22 September 2020|website=time:matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using dedicated freight trains, these use luggage racks and other unused space in passenger trains.

==Rolling stock==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
{{See also|List of high-speed trains}}
Key technologies include tilting trainsets, aerodynamic designs (to reduce drag, lift, and noise), [[Railway air brake|air brakes]], [[regenerative braking]], engine technology and [[dynamic weight shifting]].

==Comparison with other modes of transport==

===Optimal distance===
While commercial high-speed trains have lower maximum speeds than jet aircraft, they offer shorter total trip times than air travel for short distances. They typically connect city centre rail stations to each other, while air transport connects airports that are typically farther from city centres.

High-speed rail (HSR) is best suited for journeys of 1 to 4½ hours (about {{convert|150|–|900|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), for which the train can beat air and car trip time.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} For trips under about {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the process of checking in and going through airport security, as well as traveling to and from the airport, makes the total air journey time equal to or slower than HSR.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} European authorities treat HSR as competitive with passenger air for HSR trips under 4½ hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/infrastructure/studies/doc/2010_high_speed_rail_en.pdf| title=European high-speed rail – An easy way to connect| publisher=Publications Office of the European Union| year=2010| location=Luxembourg| accessdate=18 April 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419205706/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/infrastructure/studies/doc/2010_high_speed_rail_en.pdf| archive-date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HSR eliminated most air transport from between Paris–Lyon, Paris–Brussels, Cologne–Frankfurt, Madrid–Barcelona, Naples–Rome–Milan, Nanjing–Wuhan, Chongqing–Chengdu,&lt;ref name=&quot;cdaily2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/imqq/bizchina/2011-04/02/content_12267556.htm |title=High-speed rail cuts into airlines' success |work=China Daily |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo–Nagoya, Tokyo–Sendai and Tokyo–Niigata.
China Southern Airlines, China's largest airline, expects the construction of China's high-speed railway network to impact (through increased competition and falling revenues) 25% of its route network in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=a3GHSPLBfBOM |title=China Southern Says Railways to Hurt 25% of Routes (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market shares===
European data indicate that air traffic is more sensitive than road traffic (car and bus) to competition from HSR, at least on journeys of {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} and more. TGV Sud-Est reduced the travel time Paris–Lyon from almost four to about two hours. Market share rose from 40 to 72%. Air and road market shares shrunk from 31 to 7% and from 29 to 21%, respectively. On the Madrid–Sevilla link, the AVE connection increased share from 16 to 52%; air traffic shrunk from 40 to 13%; road traffic from 44 to 36%, hence the rail market amounted to 80% of combined rail and air traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310224651/http://www.aerlines.nl/issue_43/43_Jorritsma_AiRail_Substitution.pdf |author=Peter Jorritsma|page=3|title=Substitution Opportunities of High Speed Train for Air Transport|url=http://www.aerlines.nl/issue_43/43_Jorritsma_AiRail_Substitution.pdf|archive-date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure increased to 89% in 2009, according to Spanish rail operator [[RENFE]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/business/energy-environment/30trains.html Spain’s High-Speed Rail Offers Guideposts for U.S.], The New York Times, 29 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Jorritsma, the rail market share ''s'', as compared to planes, can be computed approximately as a function of the travelling time in minutes ''t'' by the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310224651/http://www.aerlines.nl/issue_43/43_Jorritsma_AiRail_Substitution.pdf |author=Peter Jorritsma|page=4|title=Substitution Opportunities of High Speed Train for Air Transport|url=http://www.aerlines.nl/issue_43/43_Jorritsma_AiRail_Substitution.pdf|archive-date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = {1 \over 0.031 \times 1.016^t + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

According to this formula, a journey time of three hours yields 65% market share, not taking into account the price of a ticket.

In another study conducted about Japan's High-speed rail service, they found a &quot;4-hour wall&quot; in high-speed rail's market share, which if the high speed rail journey time exceeded 4 hours, then people would likely choose planes over high-speed rail. For instance, from Tokyo to Osaka, a 2h22m-journey by Shinkansen, high-speed rail has an 85% market share whereas planes have 15%. From Tokyo to Hiroshima, a 3h44m-journey by Shinkansen, high-speed rail has a 67% market share whereas planes have 33%. The situation is the reverse on the Tokyo to Fukuoka route where high-speed rail takes 4h47m and rail only has 10% market share and planes 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=ja |url=http://www.j-cast.com/tv/2015/12/18253570.html |script-title=ja:「4時間の壁」切れなかった北海道新幹線！2分違いで飛行機に客流れる？|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Taiwan, [[China Airlines]] cancelled all flights to [[Taichung Airport]] within a year of [[Taiwan High Speed Rail]] starting operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lew|first=Alexander|date=2007-09-11|title=Bullet Train Challenges Airlines in Taiwan|language=en-US|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/09/another-blow-th/|access-date=2020-06-27|issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the railway has led to drastically fewer flights along the island's west coast, with flights between [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]] ceasing altogether in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2012-09-01|title=Taipei-Kaohsiung flights end - Taipei Times|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/09/01/2003541700|access-date=2020-06-27|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
Travel by rail is more competitive in areas of higher population density or where gasoline is expensive, because conventional trains are more fuel-efficient than cars when ridership is high, similar to other forms of mass transit. Very few high-speed trains consume [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or other [[fossil fuel]]s but the power stations that provide electric trains with electricity can consume fossil fuels. In Japan (prior to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]) and France, with very extensive high-speed rail networks, a large proportion of electricity comes from [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Friday, 6 January 2006, p54. ''France will run trains free from fossil fuel, says Chirac''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Eurostar, which primarily runs off the French grid, emissions from travelling by train from London to Paris are 90% lower than by flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seat61.com/CO2flights.htm|title=Cut your CO2 emissions by taking the train, by up to 90%...|publisher=[[Seat61]]|accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany 38.5% of all electricity was produced from renewable sources in 2017, however railways run on their own grid partially independent from the general grid and relying in part on dedicated power plants. Even using electricity generated from coal or oil, high-speed trains are significantly more fuel-efficient per passenger per kilometre traveled than the typical automobile because of [[economies of scale]] in generator technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economical Environmentalist|author=Prashant Vaze|page=298|publisher=Earthscan|title-link=The Economical Environmentalist}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trains themselves, as well as lower air friction and rolling resistance at the same speed.

===Automobiles and buses===
High-speed rail can accommodate more passengers at far higher speeds than automobiles. Generally, the longer the journey, the better the time advantage of rail over road if going to the same destination. However, high-speed rail can be competitive with cars on shorter distances, {{convert|0|–|150|km|mi|-1}}, for example for commuting, especially if the car users do experience road congestion or expensive parking fees. In Norway, the [[Gardermoen Line]] has made the rail market share for passengers from [[Oslo]] to the airport (42&amp;nbsp;km) rise to 51% in 2014, compared to 17% for buses and 28% for private cars and taxis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Rekordmange-kollektivreisende-til-og-fra-Oslo-Lufthavn-7949419.html Rekordmange kollektivreisende til og fra Oslo Lufthavn], in Norwegian.&lt;/ref&gt; On such short lines−particularly services which call at stations close to one another−the [[acceleration]] capabilities of the trains may be more important than their maximum speed.

Moreover, typical passenger rail carries 2.83 times as many passengers per hour per metre width as a road. A typical capacity is the [[Eurostar#Rolling stock|Eurostar]], which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train, totaling 9,600 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the [[Highway Capacity Manual]] gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 passenger cars per hour per lane, excluding other vehicles, assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2003/fcvt_fotw257.html |publisher=US Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |title=Fact #257: 3 March 2003 – Vehicle Occupancy by Type of Vehicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way),{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect [[land consumption]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 passengers per hour per direction). Similarly commuter roads tend to carry fewer than 1.57 persons per vehicle (Washington State Department of Transportation, for instance, uses 1.2 persons per vehicle) during commute times.

===Air travel===
{{prose|section|date=February 2019}}

====HSR Advantages====
* Less boarding infrastructure: Although air transit moves at higher speeds than high-speed rail, '''total time to destination''' can be increased by travel to/from far out airports, check-in, baggage handling, security, and boarding, which may also increase cost to air travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planes cheaper than trains on half of routes&quot;&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/columnists/nicktrend/8345279/Trains-or-planes-The-great-European-travel-test.html] from [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ Smith, Oliver] as of 10 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short range advantages: Trains may be preferred in short to mid-range distances since rail stations are typically closer to urban centers than airports.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Speed Train VS Airplane&quot;&gt;[http://www.techthefuture.com/mobility/high-speed-train-vs-airplane/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052549/http://www.techthefuture.com/mobility/high-speed-train-vs-airplane/ |date=4 March 2016 }} from [http://www.techthefuture.com/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074320/http://www.techthefuture.com/ |date=4 March 2016 }} as of 10 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, air travel needs longer distances to have a speed advantage after accounting for both processing time and transit to the airport.
* Urban centers: Particularly for dense city centers, short hop air travel may not be ideal to serve these areas as airports tend to be far out of the city, due to land scarcity, short runway limitations, building heights, as well as airspace issues.
* Weather: Rail travel also requires less weather dependency than air travel. A well designed and operated rail system can only be affected by severe weather conditions, such as heavy snow, heavy fog, and major storm. Flights however, often face cancellations or delays under less severe conditions.
* Comfort: High-speed trains also have comfort advantages, since train passengers are allowed to move freely about the train at any point in the journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Unique Amtrak Experience with Many Benefits&quot;&gt;[http://www.amtrak.com/the-unique-amtrak-experience-with-many-benefits] from [[Amtrak]] as of 10 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=May 2014}} Since airlines have complicated calculations to try to minimize weight to save fuel or to allow takeoff at certain runway lengths, rail seats are also less subject to weight restrictions than on planes, and as such may have more padding and legroom.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Technology advances such as [[continuously welded rail]] have minimized the [[Hunting oscillation|vibration]] found on slower railways, while air travel remains affected by [[turbulence]] when adverse wind conditions arise.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Trains can also accommodate intermediate stops at lower time and energetic costs than planes, though this applies less to HSR than to the slower conventional trains.
* Delays: On particular busy air-routes – those that HSR has historically been most successful on – trains are also less prone to delays due to congested airports, or in the case of [[China]], airspace. A train that is late by a couple of minutes will not have to wait for another slot to open up, unlike airplanes at congested airports. Furthermore, many airlines see short haul flights as increasingly uneconomic and in some countries airlines rely on high-speed rail instead of short haul flights for connecting services.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of this include SNCF who codeshares with Air France and Lufthansa's AIRail in cooperation with DB&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[De-ice#Aircraft|De-icing]]: HSR does not need to spend time deicing as planes do, which is time-consuming but critical; it can dent airline profitability as planes remain on the ground and pay airport fees by the hour, as well as take up parking space and contributing to congestive delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airlinegeeks.com/2017/12/29/the-time-consuming-but-extremely-critical-process-of-deicing-aircraft-in-the-winter/|title=The Time-Consuming But Extremely Critical Process of Deicing Aircraft in the Winter|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hot and High: Some airlines have cancelled or move their flights to takeoff at night due to [[hot and high]] conditions. Such is the case for [[Hainan Airlines]] in [[Las Vegas]] in 2017, which moved its long haul takeoff slot to after midnight. Similarly, [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] cancelled all its Europe bound flights during summer due to heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/hainan-moving-flights-to-early-mornings-to-beat-the-heat/|title=Hainan moving flights to early mornings to beat the heat|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; High speed rail may complement airport operations during hot hours when takeoffs become uneconomical or otherwise problematic.
* Noise and pollution: Major airports are heavy polluters, downwind of LAX particulate pollution doubles, even accounting for Port of LA/Long Beach shipping and heavy freeway traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/web/2014/05/Los-Angeles-Airport-Pollutes-City.html|title=Los Angeles Airport Pollutes City Air For Miles Downwind – Chemical &amp; Engineering News|first=Deirdre|last=Lockwood|website=cen.acs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trains may run on renewable energy, and electric trains produce no local pollution in critical urban areas at any rate. Of course, this effect can be mitigated with [[aviation biofuel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Noise also is an issue for residents.
* Ability to serve multiple stops: An airplane spends significant amounts of time loading and unloading cargo and/or passengers as well as landing, taxiing and starting again. Trains spend only a few minutes stopping at intermediate stations, often greatly enhancing the business case at little cost.
* Energy: high speed trains are more fuel efficient per passenger space offered than planes. Furthermore, they usually run on electricity, which can be produced from a wider range of sources than [[kerosene]].

====Disadvantages====
* HSR usually requires land acquisition, for example in [[Fresno]], California where it was caught up in legal paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/high-speed-rail/article19539180.html|title=Land-acquisition concerns continue to dog high-speed rail agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HSR is subject to [[land subsidence]], where expensive fixes sent costs soaring in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=6,23,45,6,6&amp;post=10392|title=Taiwan tackles land subsidence with water project – Taiwan Today|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|last=(Taiwan)|date=26 July 2011|website=Taiwan Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HSR can be costly due to required tunneling through mountain terrain as well as earthquake and other safety systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/transportation/report/time-end-obamas-costly-high-speed-rail-program|title=Time to End Obama's Costly High-Speed Rail Program|first=Ronald|last=Utt|website=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Crossing mountain ranges or large bodies of water with HSR requires expensive tunnels and bridges, or else slower routes and [[train ferries]], and HSR cannot cross oceans. Air routes are largely unaffected by geography.
* Airlines frequently and aggressively add and drop routes due to demand and profitability—over [https://thepointsguy.com/2017/01/airlines-added-3k-routes-2016/ 3,000 new routes in 2016]. HSR may add or drop services, but the rail line itself represents a significant [[sunk cost]] and cannot be as easily modified in response to changing market conditions. However, for passengers this can present an advantage as services are less likely to be withdrawn for railways.
* Cities do not always lie in a straight line, so any routing will include bends and twists, which can substantially increase to the length and duration of a journey. This can introduce inefficiency when compared to a [[point-to-point transit]] flight.
* Railways require the security and cooperation of all geographies and governments involved. Political issues can make routes unviable, whereas an airplane can fly over politically sensitive areas and/or be re-routed with relative ease.

====Pollution====
High speed rail usually implements electric power and therefore its energy sources can be distant or renewable. This is an advantage over air travel, which currently uses fossil fuels and is a major source of pollution. Studies regarding busy airports such as LAX, have shown that over an area of about {{convert|60|km2|abbr=off}} downwind of the airport, where hundreds of thousands of people live or work, the particle number concentration was at least twice that of nearby urban areas, showing that airplane pollution far exceeded road pollution, even from heavy freeway traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/web/2014/05/Los-Angeles-Airport-Pollutes-City.html|title=Los Angeles Airport Pollutes City Air For Miles Downwind – Chemical &amp; Engineering News|first=Deirdre|last=Lockwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trees====
Airplanes and airstrips require trees to be cut down, as they are a nuisance to pilots. Some 3,000 trees will be chopped due to obstruction issues at [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/nearly-3000-trees-around-sea-tac-airport-will-be-chopped-down|title=Nearly 3,000 trees around Sea-Tac Airport will be chopped down|first=Mitch|last=Pittman|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, trees next to rail lines can often become a hazard during winter storms, with several German media calling for trees to be cut down following autumn storms in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/sturm-herwart-bahn-101.html|title=Nach Herbststürmen – Die Bahn und der Baum|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/xavier-bahn-bestreitet-mangelnden-rueckschnitt-von-baeumen-a-1171629.html|title=Folgen von Sturmtief &quot;Xavier&quot;: Bahn bestreitet mangelnden Baumbeschnitt|date=6 October 2017|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/42/deutsche-bahn-sturm-xavier-vorbereitung-aufraeumen|title=Deutsche Bahn: Die Säge nach dem Sturm|first=Susan|last=Djahangard|date=12 October 2017|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
HSR is much simpler to control due to its predictable course. High-speed rail systems reduce (but do not eliminate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/world-news/2010/08/17/train-crash-horror-in-germany/ice-slashed-open-by-garbage-truck-15-injured.html |title=ICE train slashed open by garbage truck in Germany |publisher=Bild.de |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/world-news/2010/06/24/fatal-spain-high-speed-crash/train-kills-12-young-people-near-barcelona.html |title=Fatal high-speed train kills 12 young pedestrians near beach in Barcelona |publisher=Bild.de |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; collisions with automobiles or people, by using non-grade level track and eliminating grade-level crossings. To date the only two deadly accidents involving a high speed train on high speed tracks in revenue service were the 1998 [[Eschede train disaster]] and the 2011 [[Wenzhou train collision]] (in which speed was not a factor).

==Accidents==
In general, travel by high-speed rail has been demonstrated to be remarkably safe. The first high-speed rail network, the Japanese [[Shinkansen]] has not had any fatal accidents involving passengers since it began operating in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/26/opinion/freemark-high-speed-trains/|title=Opinion: Why high-speed rail is safe, smart|author=Yonah Freemark, Special to CNN|date=26 July 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable major accidents involving high-speed trains include the following.

===1998 Eschede accident===
{{Main|Eschede train disaster}}
In 1998, after over thirty years of high-speed rail operations worldwide without fatal accidents, the Eschede accident occurred in Germany: a poorly designed ICE 1 wheel fractured at a speed of {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}} near [[Eschede]], resulting in the derailment and destruction of almost the entire set of 16 cars, and the deaths of 101 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://danger-ahead.railfan.net/features/eschede.htm|title = Special Feature Eschede, Germany ICE High Speed Train Disaster|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = Danger Ahead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sites.google.com/site/derailmentateschede/causes-of-the-accident|title = Derailment at Eschede|accessdate = 30 December 2014|website = Derailment at Eschede}}&lt;/ref&gt; The derailment began at a switch; the accident was made worse when the derailed cars traveling at high speed struck and collapsed a road bridge located just past the switch.

===2011 Wenzhou accident===
{{Main|Wenzhou train collision}}
On 23 July 2011, 13 years after the Eschede train accident, a Chinese CRH2 traveling at {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} collided with a CRH1 which was stopped on a viaduct in the suburbs of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, China. The two trains derailed, and four cars fell off the viaduct. Forty people were killed and at least 192 were injured, 12 of them severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/25/c_131008630.htm|title=Death toll from China's train crash rises to 39, including two Americans|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster led to a number of changes in management and exploitation of high-speed rail in China. Despite the fact that speed itself was not a factor in the cause of the accident, one of the major changes was to further lower the maximum speeds in high-speed and higher-speed railways in China, the remaining {{convert|350|km/h|0|abbr=on}} becoming 300, {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}} becoming 200, and {{convert|200|km/h|0|abbr=on}} becoming 160.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-08/12/content_13097239.htm|title=Decision to slow trains met with mixed response|newspaper=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-08/23/content_13167866.htm|title=More high-speed trains slow down to improve safety|newspaper=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later they started to be restored to their original high speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhuanet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-09/21/c_136625952.htm|title=China begins to restore 350&amp;nbsp;km/h bullet train |publisher=Xinhuanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

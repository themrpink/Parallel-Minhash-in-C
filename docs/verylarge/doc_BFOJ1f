The gentrification process is typically the result of increasing attraction to an area by people with higher incomes spilling over from neighboring cities, towns, or neighborhoods. Further steps are increased [[Socially responsible investing|investment]]s in a community and the related infrastructure by [[real estate development]] businesses, local government, or [[community activist]]s and resulting [[economic development]], increased attraction of business, and lower [[crime]] rates. In addition to these potential benefits, gentrification can lead to [[population mobility|population migration]] and displacement. However, some view the fear of displacement, which is dominating the debate about gentrification, as hindering discussion about genuine progressive approaches to distribute the benefits of [[Urban renewal|urban redevelopment]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morisson|Bevilacqua|2018}}{{page needed|date=May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
[[File:Mk Berlin Pfefferberg.jpg|thumb|Symbolic gentrification in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin]]

The term gentrification has come to refer to a multi-faceted phenomenon that can be defined in different ways. Gentrification is &quot;a complex process involving physical improvement of the [[housing]] stock, housing tenure change from renting to owning, price rises and the displacement or replacement of the working-class population by the new middle class.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, 2000{{Full citation needed|date=April 2019}}; {{harvtxt|Freeman|2006|p=3}} &quot;The significant gaps in our understanding of gentrification persists despite a voluminous literature developed over several decades that perhaps reflects the chaotic nature of gentrification as a concept (Beauregard 1986). As such it means different things, under different circumstances, to different people. This chaos results from the different manifestations of gentrification and its different ways of impacting people in its wake.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians say that gentrification took place in [[ancient Rome]] and in [[Roman Britain]], where large [[villa]]s were replacing small shops by the 3rd century, AD.&lt;ref name=Roman/&gt; The word ''gentrification'' derives from ''[[gentry]]''—which comes from the Old French word ''genterise'', &quot;of gentle birth&quot; (14th century) and &quot;people of gentle birth&quot; (16th century). In England, ''[[landed gentry]]'' denoted the social class, consisting of [[gentlemen]] (and gentlewomen, as they were at that time known).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Etymology |date=1966 |editor-first1=C.

W. |editor-last3=Burchfield |title=Gentry |page=394}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gentry |title=gentry |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |first=Douglas |last=Harper |year=2001 |access-date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[sociologist]] [[Ruth Glass]] was first to use &quot;gentrification&quot; in its current sense. She used it in 1964 to describe the influx of [[middle-class]] people displacing [[Working class|lower-class]] worker residents in urban neighborhoods; her example was [[London]], and its working-class districts such as [[Islington]]:&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |title=London: aspects of change |first=Ruth |last=Glass |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=MacGibbon &amp; Kee}}) as cited in {{harvtxt|Atkinson|Bridge|2005|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been invaded by the middle-classes—upper and lower. Shabby, modest [[mews]] and cottages—two rooms up and two down—have been taken over, when their [[lease]]s have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences&amp;nbsp;... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.}}

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] report ''Health Effects of Gentrification'' defines the [[real estate]] concept of ''gentrification'' as &quot;the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value. This change has the potential to cause displacement of long-time residents and businesses&amp;nbsp;... when long-time or original neighborhood residents move from a gentrified area because of higher rents, [[mortgage]]s, and [[property tax]]es. Gentrification is a housing, economic, and health issue that affects a community's history and culture and reduces [[social capital]]. It often shifts a neighborhood's characteristics, e.g., racial-ethnic composition and household income, by adding new stores and resources in previously run-down neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt;

Scholars and pundits have applied a variety of definitions to gentrification since 1964, some oriented around gentrifiers, others oriented around the displaced, and some a combination of both. The first category include the {{harvtxt|Hackworth|2002}} definition &quot;the production of space for progressively more affluent users&quot;.{{page needed|date=May 2019}} The second category include Kasman's definition &quot;the reduction of residential and retail space affordable to low-income residents&quot;.{{sfn|Kasman|2015|p=132}} The final category includes Rose, who describes gentrification as a process &quot;in which members of the 'new middle class' move into and physically and culturally reshape working-class inner city neighbourhoods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1996}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Kennedy|Leonard|2001}} say in their [[Brookings Institution]] report that &quot;the term 'gentrification' is both imprecise and quite politically charged&quot;, suggesting its redefinition as &quot;the process by which higher income households displace lower income residents of a neighborhood, changing the essential character and flavour of that neighborhood&quot;, so distinguishing it from the different socio-economic process of &quot;neighborhood (or urban) revitalization&quot;, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

German [[geographer]]s have a more distanced view on gentrification. Actual gentrification is seen as a mere symbolic issue happening in a low number of places and blocks, the symbolic value and visibility in public discourse being higher than actual migration trends. Gerhard Hard, for instance, assumes that [[urban flight]] is still more important than inner-city gentrification.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;/&gt;
[[Volkskunde|Volkskunde scholar]] Barbara Lang introduced the term 'symbolic gentrification' with regard to the ''Mythos Kreuzberg'' in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Lang |title=Mythos Kreuzberg: Ethnographie eines Stadtteils (1961–1995) |publisher=Campus |date=1998 |isbn=978-3-593-36106-2 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang assumes that complaints about gentrification often come from those who have been responsible for the process in their youth. When former students and bohemians start raising families and earning money in better-paid jobs, they become the yuppies they claim to dislike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myt&quot;/&gt; Berlin in particular is a showcase of intense debates about symbols of gentrification, while the actual processes are much slower than in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Péter |last=Niedermüller |chapter=Soziale Brennpunkte sehen? |title=Berliner Blätter |volume=32 |publisher=LIT|location=Münster |date=2004 |isbn=978-3-8258-6996-0 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's Prenzlauer Berg district is, however, a poster child of the capital's gentrification, as this area in particular has experienced a rapid transformation over the last two decades.

American economists describe gentrification as a natural cycle: the well-to-do prefer to live in the newest housing stock. Each decade of a city's growth, a new ring of housing is built. When the housing at the center has reached the end of its useful life and becomes cheap, the well-to-do gentrify the neighborhood. The push outward from the city center continues as the housing in each ring reaches the end of its economic life.&lt;ref name=&quot;frbp170925&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lin |first1=Jeffrey |title=Understanding Gentrification's Causes |date=2017 |url=https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/economic-insights/2017/q3/eiq3_understanding-gentrifications-causes.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that ''gentrification'' has three interpretations: (a) &quot;great, the value of my house is going up, (b) coffee is more expensive, now that we have a [[Starbucks]], and (c) my neighbors and I can no longer afford to live here (''community displacement'')&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gm1502&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ehrenhalt |first1=Alan |title=What, Exactly, Is Gentrification? |url=http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-gentrification-definition-series.html |access-date=25 September 2017 |website=Governing.com |publisher=Governing Magazine |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===London and Palen===
There are several approaches that attempt to explain the roots and the reasons behind the spread of gentrification. {{harvtxt|Palen|London|1984}} compiled a list of five explanations:

# demographic-ecological,
# sociocultural,
# political-economical,
# community networks, and
# social movements.

====Demographic-ecological====
The first theory, demographic-ecological, attempts to explain gentrification through the analysis of demographics: population, social organization, environment, and technology. This theory frequently refers to the growing number of people between the ages of 25 and 35 in the 1970s, or the baby boomer generation. Because the number of people that sought housing increased, the demand for housing increased also. The supply could not keep up with the demand; therefore cities were &quot;recycled&quot; to meet such demands.

The [[baby boomers]] in pursuit of housing were very different, demographically, from their house-hunting predecessors. They married at an older age and had fewer children, and their children were born later. Women, both single and married, were entering the labor force at higher rates which led to an increase of dual wage-earner households. These households were typically composed of young, more affluent couples without children. Because these couples were child-free and were not concerned with the conditions of schools and [[playground]]s, they elected to live in the [[inner city]] in close proximity to their jobs. These more affluent people usually had white-collar, not blue-collar jobs. Since these [[white-collar worker]]s wanted to live closer to work, a neighborhood with more white-collar jobs was more likely to be invaded; the relationship between administrative activity and invasion was positively correlated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palen pages needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Palen|London|1984}}{{page needed|date=May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociocultural====
The second theory proposed by London and Palen is based on a sociocultural explanation of gentrification. This theory argues that values, sentiments, attitudes, ideas, beliefs, and choices should be used to explain and predict human behavior, not demographics, or &quot;structural units of analysis&quot; (i.e., characteristics of populations). This analysis focuses on the changing attitudes, lifestyles, and values of the middle- and upper-middle-class of the 1970s. They were becoming more pro-urban than before, opting not to live in rural or even suburban areas anymore. These new pro-urban values were becoming more salient, and more and more people began moving into the cities. London and Palen refer to the first people to invade the cities as &quot;urban pioneers&quot;. These urban pioneers demonstrated that the inner-city was an &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;viable&quot; place to live, resulting in what is called &quot;inner city chic&quot;. The opposing side of this argument is that dominant, or recurring, American values determine where people decide to live, not the changing values previously cited. This means that people choose to live in a gentrified area to restore it, not to alter it, because restoration is a &quot;new way to realize old values&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palen pages needed&quot;/&gt;

====Political-economic====
The third theoretical explanation of gentrification is political-economic and is divided into two approaches: traditional and Marxist. The traditional approach argues that economic and political factors have led to the invasion of the inner-city, hence the name political-economic. The changing political and legal climate of the 1950s and 1960s (new [[civil rights]] legislation, anti-discrimination laws in housing and employment, and [[desegregation]]) had an &quot;unanticipated&quot; role in the gentrification of neighborhoods. A societal decrease in acceptance of prejudice led to more blacks moving to the suburbs and whites no longer rejected the idea of moving to the city. The decreasing availability of suburban land and inflation in suburban housing costs also inspired the invasion of the cities. The Marxist approach denies the notion that the political and economic influences on gentrification are invisible, but are intentional. This theory claims that &quot;powerful interest groups follow a policy of neglect of the inner city until such time as they become aware that policy changes could yield tremendous profits&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palen pages needed&quot;/&gt;  Once the inner city becomes a source of revenue, the powerless residents are displaced with little or no regard from the powerful.

====Community networks====
The community-network approach is the fourth proposed by London and Palen. This views the community as an &quot;interactive social group&quot;. Two perspectives are noted: community lost and community saved. The community lost perspective argues that the role of the neighborhood is becoming more limited due to [[Technological advancement|technological advances]] in transportation and communication. This means that the small-scale, local community is being replaced with more large-scale, political and social organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, 1962 {{full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing side, the community saved side, argues that community activity increases when neighborhoods are gentrified because these neighborhoods are being revitalized.

====Social movements====
The fifth and final approach is social movements. This theoretical approach is focused on the analysis of ideologically based movements, usually in terms of leader-follower relationships. Those who support gentrification are encouraged by leaders (successful urban pioneers, political-economic elites, land developers, lending institutions, and even the Federal government in some instances) to revive the inner-city. Those who are in opposition are the people who currently reside in the deteriorated areas. They develop countermovements in order to gain the power necessary to defend themselves against the movements of the elite. An excellent example was the turned around gang in Chicago who fought for years against the Richard J. Daley machine: the [[Young Lords]] led by [[Jose Cha Cha Jimenez]]. They occupied neighborhood institutions and led massive demonstrations to make people aware. These countermovements can be unsuccessful, though. The people who support reviving neighborhoods are also members, and their voices are the ones that the gentrifiers tend to hear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palen pages needed&quot;/&gt;

===As an economic process===
Two discrete sociological theories explain and justify gentrification: one as an economic process ([[economic production|production]]-side theory); the other and as a social process ([[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]-side theory). Both occur when the suburban [[gentry]] tire of the automobile-dependent [[urban sprawl]] style of life. These professionals, [[empty nest syndrome|empty nest]] aged parents, and recent university graduates perceive attractiveness in the city center earlier abandoned during [[white flight]]—especially if the poor community possesses a [[transport hub]] and its architecture sustains the [[pedestrian]] traffic that allows the proper human relations impeded by (sub)urban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Florida |first=Richard |title=The Rise of the Creative Class: and how it's transforming work, leisure, community and everyday life |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02477-3 |title-link=The Rise of the Creative Class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, proximity to urban amenities such as transit stops has been shown to drive up home prices over time. A survey of Northwest Chicago conducted between 1975 and 1991 showed that homes located directly in the vicinity Red Line and Brown Line stops of the &quot;L&quot; rail transit system saw a huge price jump during these years, compared to only modest increases for area outside the zone. Between 1985 and 1991 in particular, homes near transit stops nearly doubled in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lin |first=Jeffrey |year=2002 |title=Gentrification and Transit in Northwest Chicago |journal=Transportation Quarterly |volume=56 |pages=175–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Smith and Marxist sociologists explain gentrification as a [[structuralism|structural]] economic process; Humanistic Geographer, [[David Ley]] explains gentrification as a natural outgrowth of increased professional employment in the central business district (CBD), and the creative sub-class's predilection for city living. {{harvtxt|Ley|1980}} describes and deconstructs the TEAM committee's effort to rendering Vancouver, BC, Canada, a &quot;livable city&quot;. The investigators Rose, Beauregard, Mullins, Moore ''et al.'', who base themselves upon Ley's ideas, posit that &quot;gentrifiers and their social and cultural characteristics [are] of crucial importance for an understanding of gentrification&quot;—theoretical work Chris Hamnett criticized as insufficiently comprehensive, for not incorporating the &quot;supply of dwellings and the role of developers [and] speculators in the process&quot;.{{sfn|Hamnett|1991|pp=186-187}}

====Production-side theory====
The theory of urban gentrification derives from the work of human geographer [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]], explaining gentrification as an [[economics|economic]] process consequent to the fluctuating relationships among [[capital (economics)|capital]] investments and the production of [[urban area|urban]] space. He asserts that restructuring of urban space is the visual component of a larger social, economic, and spatial restructuring of the contemporary capitalist economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Williams|1986}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith summarizes the causes of gentrification into five main processes: suburbanization and the emergence of [[Rent-gap theory|rent gap]], deindustrialization, spatial centralization and decentralization of capital, falling profit and cyclical movement of capital, and changes in demographics and consumption patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt;

=====Suburbanization and rent gap=====
Suburban development derives from outward expansion of cities, often driven by sought profit and the availability of cheap land. This change in consumption causes a fall in inner city land prices, often resulting in poor upkeep and a neglect of repair for these properties by owners and landlords. The depressed land is then devalued, causing rent to be significantly cheaper than the potential rent that could be derived from the &quot;best use&quot; of the land while taking advantage of its central location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; From this derives the ''Rent-gap Theory'' describing the disparity between &quot;the actual capitalized ground rent (land price) of a plot of land given its present use, and the potential ground rent that might be gleaned under a 'higher and better' use.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=462}}

The rent gap is fundamental to explaining gentrification as an economic process. When the gap is sufficiently wide, [[real estate developer]]s, [[landlord]]s, and other people with vested interests in the development of land perceive the potential [[Profit (economics)|profit]] to be derived from re-investing in inner-city properties and redeveloping them for new tenants. Thus, the development of a rent gap creates the opportunity for urban restructuring and gentrification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt;

=====De-industrialization=====
The [[de-industrialization]] of cities in developed nations reduces the number of [[blue-collar]] jobs available to the urban working class as well as middle-wage jobs with the opportunity for [[Promotion (rank)|advancement]], creating lost investment capital needed to physically maintain the houses and buildings of the city. Abandoned industrial areas create availability for land for the rent gap process.

Although gentrification may be known as “process of renovating deteriorated urban neighborhoods”, many will say that this process actually demolishes historical aspects of neighborhoods, raises residential prices too high for current residents to continue living there, and even negatively impacts the food industry by transforming the local eateries into cafes or a restaurants chain.  This impact on the food industry, specifically in Oakland, California, is being twisted from natural farm grown food into more industrialized sourced products based on consumer preferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |title=Entrepreneurship As Activism? Resisting Gentrification in Oakland, California |journal=Revista de Administação de Empresas |date=May–June 2018 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=279–90 |doi=10.1590/S0034-759020180308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As neighborhoods become gentrified, the consumer need changes; therefore, creating more expensive and modern housing and markets which then run the locals out of town and can be a threat to small businesses because of the raise in renting a store space in a more modern area.  As this threatens the small businesses, it becomes harder for most to stay open, although increasing the value of goods which the stores are selling can ensure so that the shops could still be able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meltzer |first1=Rachel |title=Gentrification and Small Businesses: Threat or Opportunity? |journal=Cityscape |date=2016 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=57–85 |id={{ProQuest|1856560399}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is why organizations such as Planting Justice and Mandela Marketplace strive to resist the acts of gentrification and to form business plans that will work to create living-wage jobs for everyone so that no one must be displaced when such “renovation” takes place.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkon&quot; /&gt;

Gentrification and deindustrialization may also help clean up neighborhoods such as those on the waterfront in Gowanus, New York; however, this clean up tends to draw the attention to commercialized developments which then build and essentially take of the nature of the waterfront.&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turan |first1=Zeynep |title=Finding the &quot;Local Green Voice&quot;? Waterfront Development, Environmental Justice, and Participatory Planning in Gowanus, NY |journal=Urbani Izziv |date=2018 |volume=29 |page=79 |doi=10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2018-29-supplement-005 |doi-access=free |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This urbanization creates a tourist attraction and raises value of living in the area to the point where locals have no choice but to move elsewhere.  Even though such cleaning of the waterfront would greatly benefit the local community, this would also invite building of an industrialized environment which will ultimately ruin any and all historical value that the neighborhood currently possesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot;/&gt;

=====Spatial centralization and decentralization of capital=====
De-industrialization is often integral to the growth of a divided [[White-collar worker|white collar]] [[employment]], providing [[professional]] and [[management]] jobs that follow the spatial decentralization of the expanding world economy. However, somewhat counter-intuitively, globalization also is accompanied by spatial centralization of urban centers, mainly from the growth of the inner city as a base for headquarter and executive decision-making centers. This concentration can be attributed to the need for rapid decisions and information flow, which makes it favorable to have executive centers in close proximity to each other. Thus, the expanding effect of suburbanization as well as agglomeration to city centers can coexist. These simultaneous processes can translate to gentrification activities when professionals have a high demand to live near their executive workplaces in order to reduce decision-making time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt;

=====Falling profit and the cyclical movement of capital=====
This section of Smith's theory attempts to describe the timing of the process of gentrification. At the end of a period of expansion for the economy, such as a [[Economic boom|boom]] in postwar suburbs, accumulation of capital leads to a falling [[rate of profit]]. It is then favorable to seek investment outside the industrial sphere to hold off onset of an [[financial crisis|economic crisis]]. By this time, the period of expansion has inevitably led to the creation of rent gap, providing opportunity for capital reinvestment in this surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt;

=====Changes in demographic and consumption patterns=====
Smith emphasizes that demographic and life-style changes are more of an exhibition of the ''form'' of gentrification, rather than real factors behind gentrification. The aging [[Baby boomers|baby-boomer]] population, greater participation of women in the workforce, and the changes in marriage and childrearing norms explain the appearance that gentrification takes, or as Smith says, &quot;why we have proliferating quiche bars rather than Howard Johnson's&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt;

====Consumption-side theory====

In contrast to the production-side argument, the ''consumption-side'' theory of urban gentrification posits that the &quot;socio-cultural characteristics and motives&quot; of the gentrifiers are most important to understanding the gentrification of the ''post-industrial city''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, 2000.{{Full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in the structure of advanced capitalist cities with the shift from industrial to service-based economy were coupled with the expanding of a new middle class—one with a larger purchasing power than ever before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt; As such, human geographer [[David Ley]] posits a rehabilitated post-industrial city influenced by this &quot;new middle class&quot;.{{sfn|Ley|1994|p=56}} The consumption theory contends that it is the demographics and consumption patterns of this &quot;new middle class&quot; that is responsible for gentrification.

The economic and cultural changes of the world in the 1960s have been attributed to these consumption changes. The antiauthoritarian protest movements of the young in the U.S., especially on college campuses, brought a new disdain for the &quot;standardization of look-alike suburbs,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley page needed&quot;/&gt; as well as fueled a movement toward empowering freedom and establishing authenticity. In the postindustrial economy, the expansion of middle class jobs in inner cities came at the same time as many of the ideals of this movement. The process of gentrification stemmed as the new middle class, often with politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] ideals, was employed in the city and recognized not only the convenient commute of a city residence, but also the appeal towards the urban lifestyle as a means of opposing the &quot;deception of the suburbanite&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley page needed&quot;/&gt;

This new middle class was characterized by professionals with life pursuits expanded from traditional economistic focus. Gentrification provided a means for the 'stylization of life' and an expression of realized profit and social rank. Similarly, Michael Jager contended that the consumption pattern of the new middle class explains gentrification because of the new appeal of embracing the historical past as well as urban lifestyle and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;  The need of the middle class to express individualism from both the upper and lower classes was expressed through consumption, and specifically through the consumption of a house as an aesthetic object. A study in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] confirm the views that the opening of [[Microbrewery|craft breweries]] is associated to early gentrification and may reinforce the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Have craft breweries followed or led gentrification in Portland, Oregon? An investigation of retail and neighbourhood change|journal=[[Geografiska Annaler|Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography]] |last1=Walker|first1=Samuel|date=7 August 2018|volume=101|last2=Fox Miller|first2=Chloe|s2cid=149499533 |issue=2|pages=102–117 |doi=10.1080/04353684.2018.1504223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These effects are becoming more widespread due to governments changing zoning and liquor laws in industrial areas to allow buildings to be used for artist studios and tasting rooms. Tourists and consumption-oriented members of the new middle class realize value in such an area that was previously avoided as a disamenity because of the externalities of industrial processes. ''Industrial integration'' occurs when an industrial area is reinvented as an asset prized for its artists and/or craft beer, integrated into the wider community, with buildings accessible to the general public, and making the neighbourhood more attractive to gentrifiers.{{sfn|Kasman|2015|p=132}}  Areas that have undergone industrial integration include the Distillery District in Toronto and the Yeast Van area of east Vancouver, Canada.

&quot;This permanent tension on two fronts is evident in the architecture of gentrification: in the external restorations of the Victoriana, the middle classes express their candidature for the dominant classes; in its internal renovation work this class signifies its distance from the lower orders.&quot; {{sfn|Lees|Slater|Wyly|2010|p=154}}

Gentrification, according to consumption theory, fulfills the desire for a space with social meaning for the middle class as well as the belief that it can only be found in older places because of a dissatisfaction with contemporary urbanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lees|Slater|Wyly|2010}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic globalization===
Gentrification is integral to the [[new economy]] of centralized, high-level services work—the &quot;new urban economic core of [[banking]] and service activities that come to replace the older, typically manufacturing-oriented, core&quot;{{sfn|Sassen|1995|p= 65}} that displaces middle-class retail businesses so they might be &quot;replaced by upmarket boutiques and restaurants catering to new high-income urban élites&quot;.{{sfn|Sassen|1995|p= 66}} In the context of [[globalization]], the city's importance is determined by its ability to function as a discrete socio-economic entity, given the lesser import of national borders, resulting in de-industrialized [[global cities]] and [[economic restructuring]].

To wit, the American urban theorist [[John Friedman]]'s seven-part theory posits a bifurcated [[service industry]] in [[global city|world cities]], composed of &quot;a high percentage of professionals specialized in control functions and&amp;nbsp;... a vast army of low-skilled workers engaged in&amp;nbsp;... personal services&amp;nbsp;... [that] cater to the privileged classes, for whose sake the world city primarily exists&quot;.{{sfn|Friedman|1995|p=322}} The final three hypotheses detail (i) the increased immigration of low-skill laborers needed to support the privileged classes, (ii) the class and caste conflict consequent to the city's inability to support the poor people who are the service class,{{sfn|Friedman|1995|pp=323–328}} and (iii) the [[global city|world city]] as a function of social class struggle—matters expanded by [[Saskia Sassen]] ''et al.'' The world city's inherent socio-economic inequality illustrates the causes of gentrification, reported in {{harvtxt|Booza|Cutsinger|Galster|2006}} demonstrating [[geographical segregation]] by income in US cities, wherein middle-income (middle class) neighborhoods decline, while poor neighborhoods and rich neighborhoods remain stable.

==Effects==
As rent-gap theory would predict, one of the most visible changes the gentrification process brings is to the infrastructure of a neighborhood. Typically, areas to be gentrified are deteriorated and old, though structurally sound, and often have some obscure [[amenity]] such as a historical significance that attracts the potential gentrifiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; Gentry purchase and restore these houses, mostly for single-family homes. In some cases, two or more adjoining property parcels are consolidated into a single lot. Another phenomenon is &quot;loft conversion,&quot; which rehabilitates mixed-use areas, often abandoned industrial buildings or run-down apartment buildings to housing for the incoming gentrifiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; Such stabilization of neighbourhoods in decline and the corresponding improvement to the image of such a neighbourhood is one of the arguments used in support of gentrification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murdie page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Murdie|Teixeira|2009}}{{page needed |date=May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentrification has been substantially advocated by local governments, often in the form of 'urban restructuring' policies. Goals of these policies include dispersing [[poverty|low-income]] residents out of the inner city and into the suburbs as well as redeveloping the city to foster mobility between both the central city and suburbia as residential options.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt; The strain on public resources that often accompanies [[concentrated poverty]] is relaxed by the gentrification process, a benefit of changed social makeup that is favorable for the local state.

Rehabilitation movements have been largely successful at restoring the plentiful supply of old and deteriorated housing that is readily available in inner cities. This rehabilitation can be seen as a superior alternative to expansion, for the location of the central city offers an intact [[infrastructure]] that should be taken advantage of: streets, public transportation, and other urban facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the changed perception of the central city that is encouraged by gentrification can be healthy for resource-deprived communities who have previously been largely ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt; Gentrifiers provide the political effectiveness needed to draw more government funding towards physical and social area improvements,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murdie page needed&quot;/&gt; while improving the overall quality of life by providing a larger tax base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quastel page needed&quot;/&gt;

A change of residence that is forced upon people who lack resources to cope has social costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot; /&gt;

There is also the argument that gentrification reduces the social capital of the area it affects. Communities have strong ties to the history and culture of their neighborhood, and causing its dispersal can have detrimental costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot; /&gt;

===Crime===
According to a 2020 review of existing research, gentrification leads to a reduction in crime in gentrifying neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=MacDonald|first1=John M.|last2=Stokes|first2=Robert J.|title=Gentrification, Land Use, and Crime|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|volume=3|pages=121–138|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-011419-041505|issn=2572-4568|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in crime generates substantial economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Autor|first1=David|last2=Palmer|first2=Christopher|last3=Pathak|first3=Parag|s2cid=27038804|date=2017|title=Gentrification and the Amenity Value of Crime Reductions: Evidence from Rent Deregulation|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w23914.pdf|language=en|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=w23914|doi=10.3386/w23914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement===
{{see also|Community displacement}}

A 2018 study found evidence that gentrification displaces renters, but not homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Isaac William|last2=Beck|first2=Kevin|s2cid=157152566|date=1 January 2018|title=Gentrification, Property Tax Limitation, and Displacement|journal=Urban Affairs Review|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|pages=33–73|doi=10.1177/1078087416666959|issn=1078-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The displacement of low-income rental residents is commonly referenced as a negative aspect of gentrification by its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quastel |2009}}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}}; {{harvnb|Murdie |Teixeira |2009}}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}}; {{harvnb|Maloutas |2011}}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}};  {{harvnb|Hackworth|2002}}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}}; {{harvnb|Dobson |2007 }}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}}; {{harvnb|Belanger |2012}}{{pages needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, other research has shown that low-income families in gentrifying neighborhoods are less likely to be displaced than in non-gentrifying neighborhoods. A common theory has been that as affluent people move into a poorer neighborhood, housing prices increase as a result, causing poorer people to move out of the neighborhood. Although there is evidence showing gentrification may modestly raise real estate prices, other studies claim that lower crime and an improved local economy outweigh the increased housing costs—displacement tends to decrease in gentrifying areas such as these as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman |2005}}{{pages needed|date=May 2019}}; {{harvnb|Vigdor|Massey |Rivlin|2002}}{{pages needed|date=May 2019}}; {{harvnb|Buntin |2015}}; {{harvnb|Vandergrift|2006}}{{pages needed|date=May 2019}}; {{harvnb|Florida |2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found &quot;that vulnerable residents, those with low credit scores and without mortgages, are generally no more likely to move from gentrifying neighborhoods compared with their counterparts in nongentrifying neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Lei|last2=Hwang|first2=Jackelyn|last3=Divringi|first3=Eileen|date=1 November 2016|title=Gentrification and residential mobility in Philadelphia|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|volume=61|pages=38–51|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2016.09.004|pmid=28579662|pmc=5450830|issn=0166-0462}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 study which followed children from low-income families in New York City found no evidence that gentrification was associated with changes in mobility rates. The study also found &quot;that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dragan|first1=Kacie|last2=Ellen|first2=Ingrid|last3=Glied|first3=Sherry|date=2019|title=Does Gentrification Displace Poor Children?

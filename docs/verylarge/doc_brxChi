At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with [[Paul Rodgers]] (founder and former lead singer of [[Free (band)|Free]] and [[Bad Company]]). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be &quot;featured with&quot; Queen as &quot;Queen + Paul Rodgers&quot;, not replacing Mercury. Deacon, who was retired, did not participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmcom_jdr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen News March 2006|publisher=brianmay.com|url=http://brianmay.com/queen/queennews/queennewsmar06c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]], and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAConcert&quot;/&gt;

Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|world tour]], which was the first time Queen toured since their [[Magic Tour (Queen)|last tour]] with Freddie Mercury in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/05/arts.artsnews1 |title=Queen most loved band |work=The Guardian |date=5 July 2005 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor said: &quot;We never thought we would tour again, Paul came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry.

 | quote = Many of you will have read bits and pieces on the internet about Queen changing record companies and so I wanted to confirm to you that the band have signed a new contract with Universal Music ... we would like to thank the EMI team for all their hard work over the years, the many successes and the fond memories, and of course we look forward to continuing to work with EMI Music Publishing who take care of our songwriting affairs. Next year we start working with our new record company to celebrate Queen's 40th anniversary and we will be announcing full details of the plans over the next 3 months. As Brian has already said Queen's next moves will involve 'studio work, computers and live work.

On 7 May 2010, May and Taylor announced that they were quitting their record label, [[EMI]], after almost 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7141990.ece | title = Can EMI pick up the pieces? | date = 2 June 2010 | last = Paphides | first = Pete | newspaper=The Times | location = London | access-date =27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August 2010, Queen's manager [[Jim Beach]] put out a Newsletter stating that the band had signed a new contract with Universal Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;label&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/queen/queennews/queennewsaug10.html |title=Queen News August 2010 |publisher=Brianmay.com |access-date=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview for ''[[HARDtalk]]'' on the BBC on 22 September, May confirmed that the band's new deal was with [[Island Records]], a subsidiary of [[Universal Music Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC_DPjh6gWA |title=Hardtalk Interview Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ4eeS5D8dc |title=Hardtalk Interview Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hollywood Records]] remained as the group's label in the United States and Canada, however. As such, for the first time since the late 1980s, Queen's catalogue now has the same distributor worldwide, as Universal distributes for both the Island and Hollywood labels (for a time in the late 1980s, Queen was on EMI-owned [[Capitol Records]] in the US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collett-White|first1=Mike|title=Queen Signs To Universal, Preps Remastered Albums|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/951467/queen-signs-to-universal-preps-remastered-albums|access-date=17 July 2014|work=Billboard|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Jane's Addiction]] vocalist [[Perry Farrell]] noted that Queen are currently scouting their once former and current live bassist [[Chris Chaney]] to join the band.

At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as &quot;Led Zeppelin meets Yes&quot; due to its combination of &quot;acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.popmatters.com/feature/142525-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-the-first-five-queen-albums/ | title= In the Lap of the Gods: The First Five Queen Albums | work=[[PopMatters]] | first=Aj | last=Ramirez | date=8 June 2011 | access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mercury stated [[Robert Plant]] as his favourite singer and Led Zeppelin as &quot;the greatest&quot; rock band, he also said Queen &quot;have more in common with [[Liza Minnelli]] than Led Zeppelin.

A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the [[vocal harmonies]] which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races''.

Having studied graphic design in art college, Mercury also designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album.&lt;ref name=LOGO/&gt; The logo combines the [[zodiac]] signs of all four members: two lions for [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] (May), and two [[fairy|fairies]] for [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (Mercury).&lt;ref name=LOGO/&gt; The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.&lt;ref name=LOGO/&gt; There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], particularly with the lion supporters.&lt;ref name=LOGO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famouslogos.net/queen-logo |title=Queen Logo |publisher=Famouslogos.net |access-date=28 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018005355/http://www.famouslogos.net/queen-logo |archive-date=18 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing.

===Software and digital releases===
In conjunction with [[Electronic Arts]], Queen released the computer game ''[[Queen: The eYe]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/songs/eye.htm |title=Queen: The Eye |publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk |date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music itself—tracks from Queen's vast catalogue, in many cases remixed into new instrumental versions—was by and large well received, but the game experience was hampered by poor gameplay. Adding to the problem was an extremely long development time, resulting in graphic elements that already seemed outdated by the time of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/3333/reviews/queen-the-eye-review/ PC Review: Queen: The Eye Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404054853/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/3333/reviews/queen-the-eye-review/ |date=4 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the supervision of May and Taylor, numerous restoration projects have been under way involving Queen's lengthy audio and video catalogue. DVD releases of their 1986 Wembley concert (titled ''[[Queen at Wembley|Live at Wembley Stadium]]''), 1982 Milton Keynes concert (''[[Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl]]''), and two Greatest Video Hits (Volumes 1 and 2, spanning the 1970s and 1980s) have seen the band's music remixed into [[surround sound|5.1]] and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] [[surround sound]]. So far, only two of the band's albums, ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''The Game'', have been fully remixed into high-resolution multichannel surround on [[DVD-Audio]]. ''A Night at the Opera'' was re-released with some revised 5.1 mixes and accompanying videos in 2005 for the 30th anniversary of the album's original release (CD+DVD-Video set). In 2007, a Blu-ray edition of Queen's previously released concerts, ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' &amp; [[Live Aid]], was released, marking their first project in 1080p HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/videos/rockmontreal.htm |title=Queen Rock Montreal (&amp; Live Aid) |publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Look! We have come through!'' is his other work from the period of the end of the war and it reveals another important element common to much of his writings; his inclination to lay himself bare in his writings. [[Ezra Pound]] in his ''Literary Essays'' complained of Lawrence's interest in his own &quot;disagreeable sensations&quot; but praised him for his &quot;low-life narrative.&quot; This is a reference to Lawrence's dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of [[Robert Burns]], in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of [[Nottinghamshire]] from his youth.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Tha thought tha wanted ter be rid o' me.
'Appen tha did, an' a'.
Tha thought tha wanted ter marry an' se
If ter couldna be master an' th' woman's boss,
Tha'd need a woman different from me,
An' tha knowed it; ay, yet tha comes across
Ter say goodbye! an' a'.
(From &quot;The Drained Cup&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Lawrence's works after his Georgian period are clearly in the modernist tradition, they were often very different from those of many other [[modernist poetry|modernist]] writers, such as Pound. Pound's poems were often austere, with every word carefully worked on. Lawrence felt all poems had to be personal sentiments, and that a sense of spontaneity was vital. He called one collection of poems ''Pansies'', partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse, but also as a pun on the French word ''panser'', to dress or bandage a wound. &quot;Pansies&quot;, as he made explicit in the introduction to ''New Poems'', is also a pun on [[Blaise Pascal]]'s ''[[Pensées]]''. &quot;The Noble Englishman&quot; and &quot;Don't Look at Me&quot; were removed from the official edition of ''Pansies'' on the grounds of obscenity, which wounded him. Even though he lived most of the last ten years of his life abroad, his thoughts were often still on England. Published in 1930, just eleven days after his death, his last work ''Nettles''  was a series of bitter, nettling but often wry attacks on the moral climate of England.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O the stale old dogs who pretend to guard
the morals of the masses,
how smelly they make the great back-yard
wetting after everyone that passes.
(From &quot;The Young and Their Moral Guardians&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two notebooks of Lawrence's unprinted verse were posthumously published as ''Last Poems'' and ''More Pansies''. These contain two of Lawrence's most famous poems about death, &quot;Bavarian Gentians&quot; and &quot;The Ship of Death&quot;.

===Literary criticism===
Lawrence's criticism of other authors often provides insight into his own thinking and writing. Of particular note is his ''Study of Thomas Hardy and Other Essays''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature''. ed. Marion Wynne Davies (1990). Prentice Hall., p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Studies in Classic American Literature]]'' Lawrence's responses to writers like [[Walt Whitman]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] also shed light on his craft.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;D. H. Lawrence's Discovery of American Literature&quot; by A. Banerjee, ''Sewanee Review'', Volume 119, Number 3, Summer 2011, pp. 469–475&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
Lawrence wrote ''[[A Collier's Friday Night]]'' about 1906–1909, though it was not published till 1939 and not performed till 1965; ''[[The Daughter-in-Law]]'' in 1913, although it was not staged till 1967, when it was well received. In 1911 he wrote ''[[The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd]]'', which he revised in 1914; it was staged in the US in 1916 and in the UK in 1920, in an amateur production. It was filmed in 1976; an adaptation was shown on television (BBC 2) in 1995. He also wrote ''Touch and Go'' towards the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and his last play, ''David'', in 1925, in the US.

==Painting==
D. H. Lawrence had a lifelong interest in painting, which became one of his main forms of expression in his last years. His paintings were exhibited at the Warren Gallery in London's [[Mayfair]] in 1929. The exhibition was extremely controversial, with many of the 13,000 people visiting mainly to gawk. The ''[[Daily Express]]'' claimed, &quot;''Fight with an Amazon'' represents a hideous, bearded man holding a fair-haired woman in his lascivious grip while wolves with dripping jaws look on expectantly, [this] is frankly indecent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_V4xBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA339|title=Lake Garda: Gateway to D. H. Lawrence's Voyage to the Sun. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2013|date=13 November 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=|isbn=9781443854139|last1=Ceramella|first1=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several artists and art experts praised the paintings. [[Gwen John]], reviewing the exhibition in [[Everyman (magazine)|''Everyman'']], spoke of Lawrence's &quot;stupendous gift of self-expression&quot; and singled out ''The Finding of Moses'', ''Red Willow Trees'' and ''Boccaccio Story'' as &quot;pictures of real beauty and great vitality&quot;. Others singled out ''Contadini'' for special praise. After a complaint, the police seized thirteen of the twenty-five paintings (including ''Boccaccio Story'' and ''Contadini''). Despite declarations of support from many writers, artists and [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]], Lawrence was able to recover his paintings only by agreeing never to exhibit them in England again. The largest collection of the paintings is now at La Fonda de Taos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafondataos.com/activities/dh-lawrence-forbidden-art|title=Lafondataos.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hotel in [[Taos, New Mexico]]. Several others, including ''Boccaccio Story'' and ''Resurrection'', are at the Humanities Research Centre of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

==''Lady Chatterley'' trial==
{{Main|R v Penguin Books Ltd.}}
A heavily censored abridgement of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was published in the United States by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1928. This edition was posthumously re-issued in paperback there both by Signet Books and by [[Penguin Books]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashbak.com/twenty-five-lady-chatterleys-lover-covers-369030/|title=1946 Penguin and Signet book covers|last=|first=|date=3 December 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the full unexpurgated edition of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the trial of Penguin under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|Obscene Publications Act of 1959]] became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 act (introduced by [[Roy Jenkins]]) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; and its derivatives and the word &quot;[[cunt]]&quot;.

Various academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including [[E. M. Forster]], [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]], [[Richard Hoggart]], [[Raymond Williams]] and [[Norman St John-Stevas]], were called as witnesses, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was &quot;not guilty&quot;. This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the UK. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor, [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]], asked if it were the kind of book &quot;you would wish your wife or servants to read&quot;.

The Penguin second edition, published in 1961, contains a publisher's dedication, which reads: &quot;For having published this book, Penguin Books were prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the [[Old Bailey]] in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of 'Not Guilty' and thus made D. H. Lawrence's last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom.&quot;

==Philosophy and politics==
Despite often writing about political, spiritual and philosophical matters, Lawrence was essentially contrary by nature and hated to be pigeon-holed.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, John (2005) D.H. Lawrence: The Life of an Outsider. Allen Lane. p.171 {{ISBN| 978-0141007311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Terry Eagleton]]&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (2005) The English novel: an introduction. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 258–260 {{ISBN| 978-1405117074}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that Lawrence was right-wing due to his lukewarm attitude to democracy, which he intimated would tend towards the levelling down of society and the subordination of the individual to the sensibilities of the ‘average’ man. In his letters to [[Bertrand Russell]] around the year 1915, Lawrence voiced his opposition to enfranchising the working class and his hostility to the burgeoning labour movements, and disparaged the [[French Revolution]], referring to &quot;Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity&quot; as the &quot;three-fanged serpent&quot;. Rather than a republic, Lawrence called for an absolute dictator and equivalent dictatrix to lord over the lower peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Letters of D. H. Lawrence|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|pages=365–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, recalling his relationship with Lawrence in [[World War I|the First World War]], Russell characterised Lawrence as a &quot;proto-German Fascist&quot;, saying &quot;I was a firm believer in democracy, whereas he had developed the whole philosophy of Fascism before the politicians had thought of it.&quot;   &lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofb017701mbp|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872 1914|work=Internet Archive|publisher=Little, Brown and company|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell felt Lawrence to be a ''positive force for evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] ''Portraits from memory'' (London, Allan and Unwin Ltd) 1956, page 112&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Lawrence wrote an epilogue to ''[[Movements in European History]]'' (a text book he wrote, originally published in 1921) in which he denounced fascism and Soviet-style socialism as bullying and “a mere worship of Force”. Further, he declared “… I believe a good form of socialism, if it could be brought about, would be the best form of government.”&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, DH (1925) Movements in European History. Oxford University Press. P. 262&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, he told his sister he would vote Labour if he was living back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, Brenda (1994) The Married Man: A Life of D. H. Lawrence. Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 276 {{ISBN| 978-1856192439}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general though, Lawrence disliked any organised groupings, and in his essay ''Democracy'' written in the late twenties, he argued for a new kind of democracy in which,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...each man shall be spontaneously himself – each man himself, each woman herself, without any question of equality entering in at all; and that no man shall try to determine the being of any other man, or of any other woman.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, DH (1936) On Democracy, Essay in Phoenix: The Posthumous Papers of D. H. Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lawrence held seemingly contradictory views on feminism. The evidence of his written works, particularly his earlier novels, indicates a commitment to representing women as strong, independent and complex; he produced major works in which young, self-directing female characters were central. In his youth he supported extending the vote to women, and once wrote, “All women in their natures are like giantesses. They will break through everything and go on with their own lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, Brenda (1994) ''The Married Man: A Life of D. H. Lawrence.'' Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 123 {{ISBN|978-1856192439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of feminist critics, notably [[Kate Millett]], have criticised, indeed ridiculed Lawrence's [[Gender politics|sexual politics]], Millett claiming that he uses his female characters as mouthpieces to promote his creed of male supremacy, and that his story ''The Woman Who Rode Away'' showed Lawrence as a pornographic sadist with its portrayal of “human sacrifice performed upon the woman to the greater glory and potency of the male.”&lt;ref&gt;Millett, Kate, 1969 (2000). ''&quot;III: The Literary Reflection&quot;. Sexual Politics.'' University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06889-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brenda Maddox]] further highlights this story and two others written around the same time, ''St. Mawr'' and ''The Princess,'' as “masterworks of misogyny”.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, Brenda (1994) ''The Married Man: A Life of D. H. Lawrence''. Sinclair-Stevenson. pp. 361-365 {{ISBN|978-1856192439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the inconsistency and at times inscrutability of his philosophical writings Lawrence continues to find an audience, and the ongoing publication of [[The Cambridge Edition of the Letters and Works of D. H. Lawrence|a new scholarly edition of his letters]] and writings has demonstrated the range of his achievement. Philosophers like [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] found in Lawrence's critique of [[Sigmund Freud]] an important precursor of anti-Oedipal accounts of the unconscious that has been much influential.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Guattari, Gilles, Félix (2004). ''Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia.'' Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous reputation==
The obituaries shortly after Lawrence's death were, with the exception of the one by [[E. M. Forster]], unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend [[Catherine Carswell]] summed up his life in a letter to the periodical ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilisation and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_VaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22owned+a+ranch+he+lived%22+%22formidable+initial%22+%22sort+of+a+rare%22|title=D.H. Lawrence: A Critical Anthology|editor1-last=Coombes|editor1-first=H.|date=1973|website=|publisher=Penguin Educational. p.217|access-date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was [[Cambridge]] literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]], who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that ''The Rainbow'', ''Women in Love'', and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.

Since 2008, an annual D. H. Lawrence Festival has been organised in Eastwood to celebrate Lawrence's life and works; in September 2016, events were held in Cornwall to celebrate the centenary of Lawrence's connection with [[Zennor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwalllive.com/events-in-st-ives-will-mark-the-centenary-of-dh-lawrence-s-time-in-zennor-during-first-world-war/story-29685652-detail/story.html|title=Centenary events will celebrate DH Lawrence's time in Zennor|last=|first=|date=5 September 2016|website=westbriton.co.uk.|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DocBook''' is a [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] [[markup language]] for technical [[documentation]]. It was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docbook.org/whatis What is DocBook?]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a semantic language, DocBook enables its users to create [[separation of presentation and content|document content in a presentation-neutral form]] that captures the logical structure of the content; that content can then be published in a variety of formats, including [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], [[EPUB]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Manual page (Unix)|man pages]], [[Web help]]&lt;ref name=&quot;webhelp-1.76.1&quot;&gt;[http://blog.kasunbg.org/2010/08/docbook-webhelp-project.html DocBook WebHelp Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|HTML Help]], without requiring users to make any changes to the source. In other words, when a document is written in DocBook format it becomes easily portable into other formats, rather than needing to be rewritten.

== Design ==

DocBook is an [[XML]] language. In its current version (5.x), DocBook's language is formally defined by a [[RELAX NG]] [[XML schema|schema]] with integrated [[Schematron]] rules. (There are also [[W3C XML Schema]]+Schematron and [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) versions of the schema available, but these are considered non-standard.)

As a semantic language, DocBook documents do not describe what their contents &quot;look like&quot;, but rather the ''meaning'' of those contents. For example, rather than explaining how the [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] for an article might be visually formatted, DocBook simply says that a particular section ''is'' an abstract. It is up to an external processing tool or application to decide where on a page the abstract should go and what it should look like or whether or not it should be included in the final output at all.

DocBook provides a vast number of semantic element tags. They are divided into three broad categories: structural, block-level, and inline.

''Structural'' tags specify broad characteristics of their contents. The &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; element, for example, specifies that its child elements represent the parts of a book. This includes a title, chapters, glossaries, appendices, and so on. DocBook's structural tags include, but are not limited to:

* ''&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt;s, can be nested with other sets
* ''&lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;s, and/or &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;s, with optional glossaries, appendices, etc.
* ''&lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled collection of one or more &lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;s—can be nested with other parts, and may have special introductory text
* ''&lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, unnumbered collection of block-level elements
* ''&lt;code&gt;chapter&lt;/code&gt;:'' Titled, numbered collection of block-level elements—chapters don't require explicit numbers, a chapter number is the number of previous chapter elements in the XML document plus 1
* ''&lt;code&gt;appendix&lt;/code&gt;:'' Contains text that represents an [[Addendum|appendix]]
* ''&lt;code&gt;dedication&lt;/code&gt;:'' Text represents the dedication of the contained structural element

Structural elements can contain other structural elements. Structural elements are the only permitted top-level elements in a DocBook document.

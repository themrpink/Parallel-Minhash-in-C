The former county courthouse was located northeast of the intersection of Jericho Turnpike (NY Route 25) and the aptly named County Courthouse Road in an unincorporated area of the Town of North Hempstead, variously referred to in the present day as Garden City Park or New Hyde Park. The site is now a shopping center anchored by a supermarket and is located in the New Hyde Park 11040 Zip Code.

The [[1850 United States Census]] was the first in which the population of the three western towns exceeded that of the three eastern towns that are now part of Nassau County.

In 1899, New York City conducted a [[surveying|land survey]] to determine the exact border of Queens between [[the Rockaways]] and [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]. This proved difficult because the border was defined as &quot;middle of the channel between Rockaway Beach and Shelter Island&quot; (now called Long Beach Island), and that particular channel had closed up by 1899. The surveyors had to determine where the channel had been when the consolidation law was written in 1894. The surveyors did so in part by speaking with local fishermen and oystermen who knew the area well.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://search.proquest.com/docview/95757148/BD25555A229249F7PQ/59 The East City Line Fixed: Its Base Found in the Sand of a Closed Beach Channel]&quot;.

From 1905 to 1908 the [[Long Island Rail Road]] in Queens became electrified. Transportation to and from [[Manhattan]], previously by ferry or via bridges in Brooklyn, opened up with the [[Queensboro Bridge]] finished in 1909, and with railway tunnels under the [[East River]] in 1910. From 1915 onward, much of Queens was connected to the [[New York City Subway]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In later years, Queens was the site of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. [[LaGuardia Airport]], in northern Queens, opened in 1939. Idlewild Airport, in southern Queens and now called [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], opened in 1948. [[American Airlines Flight 587]] took off from the latter airport on November 12, 2001, but ended up crashing in Queens' [[Belle Harbor, Queens|Belle Harbor]] area, killing 265 people. In late October 2012, much of Queens' [[Breezy Point, Queens|Breezy Point]] area was destroyed by a massive six-alarm fire caused by [[Hurricane Sandy]].

[[Brooklyn]], the only other New York City borough on geographic Long Island, lies just south and west of Queens, with [[Newtown Creek]], an [[estuary]] that flows into the [[East River]], forming part of the border. To the west and north is the East River, across which is [[Manhattan]] to the west and [[The Bronx]] to the north. [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] is east of Queens on Long Island. [[Staten Island]] is southwest of Brooklyn, and shares only a 3-mile-long water border (in the Outer Bay) with Queens. North of Queens are [[Flushing Bay]] and the [[Flushing River]], connecting to the [[East River]]. The East River opens into [[Long Island Sound]]. The midsection of Queens is crossed by the [[Long Island#Geography|Long Island straddling terminal moraine]] created by the [[Wisconsin Glacier]].

Four [[United States Postal Service]] postal zones serve Queens, based roughly on those serving the towns in existence at the consolidation of the five boroughs into New York City: Long Island City ([[ZIP code]]s starting with 111), Jamaica (114), Flushing (113), and [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]] (116). Also, the [[Floral Park, Queens|Floral Park]] post office (110), based in Nassau County, serves a small part of northeastern Queens. Each of these main post offices has neighborhood stations with individual ZIP codes, and unlike the other boroughs, these station names are often used in addressing letters. These ZIP codes do not always reflect traditional neighborhood names and boundaries; &quot;[[East Elmhurst, Queens|East Elmhurst]]&quot;, for example, was largely coined by the USPS and is not an official community. Most neighborhoods have no solid boundaries. The [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] and [[Rego Park, Queens|Rego Park]] neighborhoods, for instance, overlap.

Residents of Queens often closely identify with their neighborhood rather than with the borough or city. The borough is a patchwork of dozens of unique neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity:
* [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], one of the largest neighborhoods in Queens, has a large and growing [[Asian people|Asian]] community. The community consists of [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[South Asian]]s. Asians have now expanded eastward along the [[Northern Boulevard|Northern Boulevard axis]] through [[Murray Hill, Queens|Murray Hill]], [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], [[Bayside, Queens|Bayside]], [[Douglaston–Little Neck, Queens|Douglaston–Little Neck]], and eventually into adjacent [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2014/04/10/chinese-real-estate-buyers-fan-out-to-long-islands-north-shore/ |title=Join The Great Gatsby: Chinese Real Estate Buyers Fan Out To Long Island's North Shore |author=Heng Shao |website=Forbes |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NassauLongIslandKoreatown&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-27/one-percenters-drop-six-figures-at-long-island-mall.html |title=One Percenters Drop Six Figures at Long Island Mall |first=Carol |last=Hymowitz |website= Bloomberg L.P |date=October 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neighborhoods historically contained [[Italian American]]s and Greeks, as well as [[Latino American]]s.

===2010 U.S. Census===
In the [[2010 United States Census]], Queens recorded a population of 2,230,722. There were 780,117 households enumerated, with an average of 2.82 persons per household. The [[population density]] was 20,465.3 inhabitants per square mile (7,966.9/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 835,127 housing units at an average density of 7,661.7 per square mile (2,982.6/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup of the county was 39.7% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 19.1% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.7% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 22.9% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.1% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 12.9% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.5% from two or more races. 27.5% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race. The non-Hispanic/Latino white population was 27.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;/&gt;

The New York City Department of City Planning was alarmed by the negligible reported increase in population between 2000 and 2010. Areas with high proportions of immigrants and undocumented aliens are traditionally undercounted for a variety of reasons, often based on a mistrust of government officials or an unwillingness to be identified. In many cases, counts of vacant apartment units did not match data from local surveys and reports from property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Sam |date=May 24, 2011 |title=Survey Hints at a Census Undercount in New York City |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/nyregion/survey-suggests-census-undercounted-new-york-city.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=September 12, 2016 |quote=How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?... Often, though, owners of illegally divided houses are reluctant to disclose the number of tenants, who tend to include people who are in the country illegally and are leery of providing any information to the government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 estimates===
As of 2018, the population of Queens was estimated by the [[United States Census Bureau]] to have increased to 2,278,906, a rise of 2.2%. Queens' estimated population represented 27.1% of New York City's population of 8,398,748; 29.6% of Long Island's population of 7,701,172; and 11.7% of New York State's population of 19,542,209. There are 865,878 housing units, and 777,904 households, 2.97 persons per household, and a median value of $481,300. There is an owner-occupancy rate of 44.5.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 2010, Queens held a disproportionate share of several Asian communities within New York City, relative to its overall population, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/DPDP1/0500000US36081 |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 - 2010 Demographic Profile Data Queens County, New York |website=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=April 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141225191036/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/DPDP1/0500000US36081 |archive-date=December 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queens has the third largest [[Bosnian American|Bosnian]] population in the United States behind only [[St. Louis]] and [[Chicago]], numbering more than 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quchronicle.com/2012/02/the-refugee/ |first=Catherine |last=Boudreau |date=February 22, 2012 |title=The Refugee |newspaper=[[Quinnipiac Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jewish Community Study of New York 2011'', sponsored by the [[UJA-Federation of New York]], found that about 9% of Queens residents were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/studies/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=2852 |title=Jewish Community Study of New York 2011: Comprehensive Report |date=June 2012 |website=UJA-Federation of New York |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were about 198,000 [[Jews in New York City|Jews in Queens]], making it home to about 13% of all people in Jewish households in the eight-county area consisting of the Five Boroughs and [[Westchester County|Westchester]], [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]], and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Community Study of New York 2011: Comprehensive Report p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian-speaking Jews make up 28% of the Jewish population in Queens, the largest in any of the eight counties.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Community Study of New York 2011: Comprehensive Report p.227.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queens, the black population earns more than whites on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/nyregion/01census.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Black Incomes Surpass Whites in Queens |first=Sam |last=Roberts |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these African Americans live in quiet, middle-class suburban neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as [[Laurelton, Queens|Laurelton]] and [[Cambria Heights]] which have large black populations whose family income is higher than average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, and Douglaston–Little Neck have not had a substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a [[real estate]] boom making most of its neighborhoods desirable for people who want to reside near Manhattan but in a less urban setting.

The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low mass stars. The mass loss events can be witnessed today in the [[planetary nebula]]e phase of low-mass star evolution, and the explosive ending of stars, called [[supernova]]e, of those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.

The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of [[technetium]] in the atmosphere of a [[red giant]] star in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merrill |first1=S. P. W. |date=1952 |title=Spectroscopic Observations of Stars of Class |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=116 |issue= |pages=21 |bibcode=1952ApJ...116...21M |doi=10.1086/145589}}&lt;/ref&gt; by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because [[technetium]] is radioactive, with a half-life much less than the age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20–50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the [[s-process]] within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the [[isotopes|isotopic]] compositions of [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of [[cosmic dust]] and is frequently called [[presolar grains]]. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D.

===Explosive nucleosynthesis===

{{Main|r-process|rp-process|Supernova nucleosynthesis}}

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] occurs in the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodansky |first1=D. |last2=Clayton |first2=D. D. |last3=Fowler |first3=W. A. |date=1968 |title=Nuclear Quasi-Equilibrium during Silicon Burning |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=16 |issue= |pages=299 |bibcode=1968ApJS...16..299B |doi=10.1086/190176|url=https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1311&amp;context=physastro_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt; established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si. Quasiequilibrium can be thought of as ''almost equilibrium'' except for a high abundance of the &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes7/&gt; was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (''A'' = 28) and nickel (''A'' = 60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited [[alpha process]] of the [[B2FH paper|B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper]], which inadvertently obscured Hoyle's 1954 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |title=Hoyle's Equation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2007 |volume=318 |issue=5858 |pages=1876–1877 |bibcode=|doi=10.1126/science.1151167|pmid=18096793 |s2cid=118423007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the [[r-process]] (rapid process) described by the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeger |first1=P. A. |last2=Fowler |first2=W. A. |last3=Clayton |first3=D. D. |date=1965 |title=Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=11 |issue= |pages=121 |bibcode=1965ApJS...11..121S |doi=10.1086/190111|url=http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1307&amp;context=physastro_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free [[neutron]]s. The creation of free neutrons by [[electron capture]] during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with the assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a ''primary process'', and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH designation of the process as a ''secondary process''. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who had observed old stars born when galactic [[metallicity]] was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

The [[rp-process]] (rapid proton) involves the rapid absorption of free [[proton]]s as well as neutrons, but its role and its existence are less certain.

Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too rapidly for radioactive decay to decrease the number of neutrons, so that many abundant isotopes with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are synthesized by the silicon quasi-equilibrium process.&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968/&gt; During this process, the burning of oxygen and silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium nuclei, up to 15 (representing &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni). Such multiple-alpha-particle nuclides are totally stable up to &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca (made of 10 helium nuclei), but heavier nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are tightly bound but unstable. The quasi-equilibrium produces radioactive [[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]] [[titanium-44|&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti]], &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, which (except &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) are created in abundance but decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the corresponding element at the same atomic weight. The most abundant and extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe. These decays are accompanied by the emission of gamma-rays (radiation from the nucleus), whose [[spectroscopic lines]] can be used to identify the isotope created by the decay. The detection of these emission lines were an important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.&lt;ref name=Clayton1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |last2=Colgate |first2=S. A. |last3=Fishman |first3=G. J. |date=1969 |title=Gamma-Ray Lines from Young Supernova Remnants |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=155 |issue= |pages=75 |bibcode=1969ApJ...155...75C |doi=10.1086/149849|url=https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1313&amp;context=physastro_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most convincing proof of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae occurred in 1987 when those gamma-ray lines were detected emerging from [[supernova 1987A]]. Gamma-ray lines identifying &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co nuclei, whose half-lives limit their age to about a year, proved that their radioactive cobalt parents created them. This nuclear astronomy observation was predicted in 1969&lt;ref name=Clayton1969/&gt; as a way to confirm explosive nucleosynthesis of the elements, and that prediction played an important role in the planning for NASA's [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]].

Other proofs of explosive nucleosynthesis are found within the stardust grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of [[cosmic dust]]. In particular, radioactive &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti was measured to be very abundant within supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova expansion.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004/&gt; This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of [[presolar grains]]. Other unusual isotopic ratios within these grains reveal many specific aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis.

===Neutron star collision===
[[Neutron star collision]]s are now believed to be the main source of [[r-process]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |date=16 July 2013 |title=All the Gold in the Universe Could Come from the Collisions of Neutron Stars |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/all-the-gold-in-the-universe-could-come-from-the-collisions-of-neutron-stars-13474145/?page=1 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being neutron-rich by definition, collisions of this type had been suspected of being a source of such elements, but definitive evidence was difficult to obtain. In 2017 strong evidence emerged, when [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and [[INTEGRAL]], along with a collaboration of many observatories around the world, detected both [[gravitational wave]] and electromagnetic signatures of a likely neutron star collision, [[GW170817]], and subsequently detected signals of numerous heavy elements such as gold as the ejected [[Degenerate_matter#Neutron_degeneracy|degenerate matter]] decays and cools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chu |first=J. |date=n.d. |url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817 |title=GW170817 Press Release |publisher=[[LIGO]]/[[Caltech]] |accessdate=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic ray spallation===
{{main|Cosmic ray spallation}}
Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of [[deuterium]]). Most notably spallation is believed to be responsible for the generation of almost all of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and the elements [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]], although some {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|7}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Beryllium|7}} are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The spallation process results from the impact of [[cosmic rays]] (mostly fast protons) against the [[interstellar medium]]. These impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in the cosmos at much greater abundances than they are found within solar atmospheres. The quantities of the light elements &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He produced by spallation are negligible relative to their primordial abundance.

Beryllium and boron are not significantly produced by stellar fusion processes, since [[beryllium-8|&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be]] is not particle-bound.

==Empirical evidence==

Theories of nucleosynthesis are tested by calculating [[isotope]] abundances and comparing those results with observed abundances. Isotope abundances are typically calculated from the transition rates between isotopes in a network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a few key reactions control the rate of other reactions.

==Minor mechanisms and processes==

Tiny amounts of certain nuclides are produced on Earth by artificial means. Those are our primary source, for example, of [[technetium]]. However, some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have continued after primordial elements were in place. These often act to create new elements in ways that can be used to date rocks or to trace the source of geological processes. Although these processes do not produce the nuclides in abundance, they are assumed to be the entire source of the existing natural supply of those nuclides.

These mechanisms include:
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[radiogenic]] [[daughter nuclide]]s. The nuclear decay of many long-lived primordial isotopes, especially [[uranium-235]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]] produce many intermediate daughter nuclides before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth's natural supply of elements like [[radon]] and [[polonium]] is via this mechanism. The atmosphere's supply of [[argon-40]] is due mostly to the radioactive decay of [[potassium-40]] in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. [[Helium-4]] is produced by alpha-decay, and the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial. In other types of radioactive decay, such as [[cluster decay]], larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become newly formed stable atoms.
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[spontaneous fission]]. This is not cluster decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and [[promethium]] are produced in this manner.
* [[Nuclear reactions]]. Naturally occurring nuclear reactions powered by [[radioactive decay]] give rise to so-called [[nucleogenic]] nuclides. This process happens when an energetic particle from radioactive decay, often an alpha particle, reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can also be produced in spontaneous fission and by [[neutron emission]]. These neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced fission, or by [[neutron capture]]. For example, some stable isotopes such as neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several routes of nucleogenic synthesis, and thus only part of their abundance is primordial.
* Nuclear reactions due to cosmic rays. By convention, these reaction-products are not termed &quot;nucleogenic&quot; nuclides, but rather [[cosmogenic]] nuclides. Cosmic rays continue to produce new elements on Earth by the same cosmogenic processes discussed above that produce primordial beryllium and boron. One important example is [[carbon-14]], produced from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. [[Iodine-129]] is another example.

== History ==
The bank was established on December 1, 1948, based on the consolidation of the Huabei Bank, the Beihai Bank and the Xibei Farmer Bank. The headquarters was first located in [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]], and then moved to Beijing in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978 the PBC was the only bank in the People's Republic of China and was responsible for both [[central bank]]ing and [[commercial bank]]ing operations.  All other banks within Mainland China such as the [[Bank of China]] were either organized as divisions of the PBC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boc.cn/en/aboutboc/ab1/200808/t20080814_1601747.html &quot;History of Bank of China&quot;], ''Boc.cn'', Retrieved 2015-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or were non-deposit taking agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccb.com/en/investor/history.html &quot;History&quot;], China Construction Bank webpage. Retrieved 2015-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. Zimmerman 2010. China Law Deskbook. p.449. https://books.google.com/books?id=oDpWHVz2tO0C&amp;pg=PA449&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952 to 1955 government shares were added to private banks to make state-private banks, until under the first Five Year plan from 1955 to 1959 the PBOC had complete control of the private banks, making them branches of the PBOC, closely resembling the vision of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. With aid from the [[Soviet Union]], the shares of private enterprises and with them industrial output followed a similar path, forming a Soviet-style [[planned economy]].

With the exception of special allocations for rural development, the monolithic PBOC dominated all business transactions and credit until 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Becky Chiu, Mervyn Lewis 2006. Reforming China's State-owned Enterprises and Banks. p.188-189. https://books.google.com/books?id=-GTCsC6AqVUC&amp;pg=PA188&lt;/ref&gt; when, as part of the [[Chinese economic reform]]s, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] split off the commercial banking functions of the PB into four independent but state-owned banks, including the [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]] (ICBC), the [[Bank of China]] (BOC), the [[Agricultural Bank of China]] (ABC), and the [[China Construction Bank]] (CCB).&lt;ref&gt;James M. Zimmerman 2010. China Law Deskbook. p.450. https://books.google.com/books?id=oDpWHVz2tO0C&amp;pg=PA450&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the State Council promulgated that the PBC would function as the central bank of China.

[[Chen Yuan]] was instrumental in modernizing the bank in the early 1990s. Its central bank status was legally confirmed on March 18, 1995 by the 3rd Plenum of the 8th National People's Congress, and was granted a high degree of independence by an act that year.&lt;ref&gt;Becky Chiu, Mervyn Lewis 2006. Reforming China's State-owned Enterprises and Banks. p.203. https://books.google.com/books?id=-GTCsC6AqVUC&amp;pg=PA203&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the PBC underwent a major restructuring. All provincial and local branches were abolished, and the PBC opened nine regional branches, whose boundaries did not correspond to local administrative boundaries. In 2003, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress]] approved an amendment law for strengthening the role of PBC in the making and implementation of monetary policy for safeguarding the overall financial stability and provision of financial services.

== Management ==
The top management of the PBC are composed of the governor and a certain number of deputy governors. The governor of the PBC is appointed into or removed by the [[National People's Congress]] or its [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]]. The candidate for the governor of the PBC is nominated by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] approved by the [[National People's Congress]]. When the National People's Congress is in adjournment, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] sanctions the candidacy for the governor of the PBC. The deputy governors of the PBC are appointed to or removed from office by the Premier of the State Council.

The PBC adopts a governor responsibility system under which the governor supervises the overall work of the PBC while the deputy governors provide assistance to the governor to fulfill his or her responsibility.

The current governor is [[Yi Gang]]. Deputy governors of the management team include: [[Wang Huaqing]], [[Pan Gongsheng]], Fan Yifei, [[Guo Qingping]], Zhang Xiaohui, and Yang Ziqiang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/953/index.html &quot;Management Team&quot;], ''Pbc.gov.cn'', November 23, 2015. Retrieved 2015-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Former top-level managers include: Ms. [[Hu Xiaolian]], [[Liu Shiyu]], [[Li Dongrong]] and Ms. [[Jin Qi]].

== Interest rates ==
Previously, interest rates set by the bank were always divisible by nine, instead of by 25 as in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aryAqtnIpaus | work=Bloomberg | title=Calendar, Abacus Help Determine Size of Chinese Rate Increases | date=May 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/viewpt/20060629e.htm|title=Viewpoint: The &quot;divisible by nine&quot; rule|website=Info.gov.hk|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, since the central bank began to increase rates by 0.25 percentage points on October 19, 2010, this is no longer the case.

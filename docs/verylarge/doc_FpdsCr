Her family included several prominent women who exercised power in politics, war, and administration as regents and queen-lieutenants. Her mother, [[Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine|Isabella of Lorraine]], fought wars on behalf of her husband while he was imprisoned and ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] by her own right, and her paternal grandmother, [[Yolande of Aragon]], ruled the Duchy of Anjou as regent for her son while Margaret was a child, repelling English military presence and supported the disinherited Dauphin.&lt;ref name=&quot;K19&quot;&gt;Kendall, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt; It has been suggested that this family example informed her later actions as regent for her son.&lt;ref name=&quot;K19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Johnson|first=Elizabeth|title=Shadow King: The Life and Death of Henry VI|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2019|isbn=9781784979645|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes to women's exercise of power were different in Western Europe than in England, and England at the time was more opposed to women exercising authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Earenfight|first=Theresa|title=Queenship in Medieval Europe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=9780230276468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage, Concession of Maine, and Subsequent Rule ===

Margaret met with English envoys at [[Tours]] on 4 May 1444, to discuss the marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; On 24 May, she was formally betrothed to Henry by proxy. Her uncle, [[Charles VII of France]], who may have suggested the marriage as part of the peace effort, was present.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Brut; or, the Chronicles of England|publisher=Early English Text Society|year=1908|editor-last=Brie|editor-first=Friedrich|location=London|pages=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was negotiated principally by [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]], and the settlement included a remarkably small dowry, consisting of 20,000 francs and the unrealised claim, via Margaret's mother, to the occupied territories of Majorca and Minorca.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Johnson|first=Elizabeth|title=Shadow King: The Life and Death of Henry VI|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2019|isbn=9781784979645}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained the promise of a twenty-three-month truce with France.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Opinions were mixed as to the wisdom of the marriage,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Ralph Alan|title=The reign of King Henry VI|date=2004|publisher=Sutton|isbn=0-7509-3777-7|oclc=474634628}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing understanding was that it represented a genuine effort at peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt;

Loans were taken out by the government in order to pay for the considerable expense of transporting Margaret to England. Solicitation for loans emphasised the role that the marriage, and Margaret herself, would play in seeking peace with France. This was a theme continued throughout the preparations for her wedding. She arrived in England on 9 April 1445, and travelled to London accompanied by various lords and courtiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt; She reached London on 28 May, where she was met by the mayor and [[Alderman|aldermen]] of the city. The predicted turnout for her arrival and procession was so large that on 8 May an inspection of roofs and balconies was ordered due to the expectation that spectators would use them as vantage points for her progress.&lt;ref&gt;Corporation of London Records Office, Journal IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ceremonial progress through the city lasted two days, the intervening night spent, by custom, in the [[Tower of London]]. It was accompanied by eight theatrical pageants. Five of these pageants concerned the peace with France, casting Margaret as a symbol of, or the agent of, peace. Three spoke of her spiritual role as a redeemer and intercessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt; It is uncertain whether these pageants represented a propaganda effort on the part of the Crown&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; or reflected popular sentiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt;

On 23 April 1445, Margaret married King [[Henry VI of England]] at [[Titchfield Abbey]] in [[Hampshire]]. She was fifteen, and he was twenty-three. She was then crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] on 30 May 1445 at [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[John Stafford (bishop)|John Stafford]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Margaret Lucille Kekewich, ''The Good King: René of Anjou and Fifteenth Century Europe'', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that anticipated the future return of English claims to French territory believed that she already understood her duty to protect the interests of the Crown fervently.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Helen E.|title=Margaret of Anjou : Queenship and Power in Late Medieval England|date=2004|publisher=Boydell|isbn=978-1-84383-104-4|location=Woodbridge|ref=MaurerH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding and her transport were very expensive, estimated by some historians at more than £5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolffe|first=Bertram Percy|title=Henry VI|year=2001|isbn=0-300-08926-0|pages=180|oclc=1039082963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her coronation, Rene of Anjou entered negotiations with the English crown, attempting to barter a lifetime's alliance and a twenty-year truce in exchange for the cession of the English-held territory of Maine to Anjou, and Henry's agreement to abandon his claim to Anjou.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt; Ultimately, the agreement ended without an alliance with Anjou and with the loss of Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Rumours that the concession of Maine was part of Margaret's marriage settlement, though false, circulated, and were repeated by chroniclers. Margaret, alongside Henry, corresponded closely with Charles VIII regarding the agreement, attempting to act as a mediator.

The loss of Maine, regarded as a betrayal, was deeply unpopular with the English public,&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt; who were already inclined to mistrust Margaret due to her French origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Blame was cast on William de la Pole, due to his role in negotiations. The reputation of Margaret's marriage suffered as a result, although she herself was not openly blamed for the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt;

In the early years of their marriage, prior to Henry's illness, Margaret and Henry spent significant proportions of their time together by choice. They shared an interest in education and culture. On 30 March 1448, she was granted license to found Queens' College, Cambridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Prior to 1453, there is little evidence of public political efforts on her part.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Most of her surviving letters were written during this period, and the majority pertain to acts of intercession, mediation, and intervention in matters on which she had been asked to act, such as the arranging of marriages, the return of wrongfully taken property, and the collection of alms. These were expected and important parts of the role of a noblewoman or queen. Some were successful, and others regarded as high-handed or ill-thought-out; in one occasion, she recommended a man named Alexander Manning to the role of gaoler at Newgate; shortly after, he turned the prisoners loose in an act of protest at his rumoured dismissal for negligence and was then jailed himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaurerH&quot; /&gt;

===Birth of a son===
Henry, who was more interested in religion and learning than in military matters, was not a successful king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=1066 And All That|url=https://archive.org/details/1066allthatmemor0000sell|url-access=registration|last1=Sellar|first1=W.C.|last2=Yeatman|first2=R.J.|publisher=Methuen|year=1930|pages=[https://archive.org/details/1066allthatmemor0000sell/page/46 46]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had reigned since he was only a few months old and his actions had been controlled by protectors, magnates who were effectively regents. When he married Margaret, his mental condition was already unstable and by the time of the birth of their only son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]] (born 13 October 1453), he had suffered a complete breakdown.

Although Margaret was aggressively partisan and had a volatile temperament,&lt;ref name=&quot;K19&quot;/&gt; she shared her husband's love of learning by dint of her cultured upbringing and gave her patronage to the founding of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].

[[Elizabeth Woodville]] (born ca 1437), later Queen of England as the wife of Margaret's husband's rival, [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], purportedly served Margaret of Anjou as a [[maid of honour]]. However, the evidence is too scanty to permit historians to establish this with absolute certainty: several women at Margaret's court bore the name Elizabeth or Isabella Grey.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith28&quot;&gt;

==Beginnings of the dynastic civil wars==

===Enmity between Margaret and the Duke of York===
[[Image:Arms of Margaret of Anjou.svg|thumb|right|Margaret of Anjou's arms as Queen consort of England.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell, p.276.&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
After retiring from London to live in lavish state at [[Greenwich]], Margaret was occupied with the care of her young son and did not display any signs of political will until she believed her husband was threatened with deposition by the ambitious [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]],&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp.30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; who, to her consternation, had been appointed Lord Protector while Henry was mentally incapacitated from 1453 to 1454. The duke was a credible claimant to the English throne and by the end of his protectorship there were many powerful nobles and relatives prepared to back his claim. The Duke of York was powerful; Henry's advisers corrupt; Henry himself trusting, pliable, and increasingly unstable; Margaret defiantly unpopular, grimly and gallantly determined to maintain the English crown for her progeny. Yet at least one scholar identifies the source of the eventual Lancastrian downfall not as York's ambitions nearly so much as Margaret's ill-judged enmity toward York and her over-indulgence in unpopular allies.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 18, 19 &amp; 24: &quot;Excessive greed and ambition—the besetting sins of his contemporary peers—seem to have been largely absent from his character. It would require the unrelenting enmity of a queen to remind him that he owned a better title to the throne than Henry the Sixth,&quot; id. at 18.&quot; It appears that Richard, Duke of York, was neither aiming at the crown nor seeking more of a voice in the government than he was entitled to. He represented, to many Englishmen of the day, the only hope of rescue from the swamp of disorder and evil rule in which the realm was floundering.&quot; Id. at p.517, n8.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Queen Margaret was a powerful force in the world of politics. King Henry was putty in her hands when she wanted something done.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret's biographer Helen Maurer, however, disagrees with earlier historians having dated the much-vaunted enmity between the Queen and York to the time he obtained the office of the protectorship. She suggests the mutual antagonism came about two years later in 1455 in the wake of the [[First Battle of St Albans]], when Margaret perceived him as a challenge to the king's authority. Maurer bases this conclusion on a judicious study of Margaret's pattern of presenting gifts; this revealed that Margaret took a great deal of care to demonstrate that she favoured both York and Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) equally in the early 1450s. Maurer also claims that Margaret appeared to accept York's protectorship and asserts there is no substantial evidence to back up the long-standing belief that she was responsible for the Yorkists' exclusion from the Great Council following Henry's recovery ([[#Leader of Lancastrian faction|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/355 Review of Maurer, Helen (2003). ''Margaret of Anjou: Queenship and Power in Late Medieval England''.] Retrieved 1 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The late historian [[Paul Murray Kendall]], on the other hand, maintained that Margaret's allies Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole]], then Earl of Suffolk, had no difficulty in persuading her that York, until then one of Henry VI's most trusted advisers, was responsible for her unpopularity and already too powerful to be trusted. Margaret not only convinced Henry to recall York from his post as governor in France and banish him instead to Ireland, she repeatedly attempted to have him assassinated during his travels to and from Ireland, once in 1449 and again in 1450.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp. 21–23, citing ''The Paston Letters,'' vol. 4, as original source.&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk's joint responsibility for the secret surrender of Maine in 1448, and then the subsequent disastrous loss of the rest of Normandy in 1449 embroiled Margaret and Henry's court in riots, uprisings by the magnates, and calls for the impeachment and execution of Margaret's two strongest allies. It also might have made an ultimate battle to the death between Margaret and the House of York inevitable by making manifest Richard's dangerous popularity with the Commons. Richard of York, safely returned from Ireland in 1450, confronted Henry and was readmitted as a trusted advisor. Soon thereafter, Henry agreed to convene Parliament to address the calls for reform. When Parliament met, the demands could not have been less acceptable to Margaret: not only were both Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk impeached for criminal mismanagement of French affairs and subverting justice, but it was charged as a crime against Suffolk (now a duke) that he had antagonised the king against the Duke of York. Further, the demands for reform put forward included that the Duke of York be acknowledged as the first councillor to the king, and the Speaker of Commons, perhaps with more fervour than wisdom, even proposed Richard, Duke of York, be recognised as heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp.21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months, however, Margaret had regained control of Henry, Parliament was dissolved, the incautious Speaker thrown in prison, and Richard of York retired to Wales for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp.13–14. When York and the king and queen met again, on a field of truce at Blackheath in 1452, he found himself ambushed and taken prisoner while Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) was again restored to honours. Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1457, the kingdom was again outraged when it was discovered that [[Pierre de Brézé]], a powerful French general and an adherent of Margaret, had landed on the English coast and burnt the town of [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. As leader of a French force of 4,000 men from [[Honfleur]], he aimed at taking advantage of the chaos in England. The mayor, John Drury, was killed in this raid. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe mourning this ignoble deed. Margaret, in association with de Brézé, became the object of scurrilous rumours and vulgar ballads. Public indignation was so high that Margaret, with great reluctance, was forced to give the Duke of York's kinsman [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], a commission to keep the sea for three years. He already held the post of [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais|Captain of Calais]].&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of Lancastrian faction===
Hostilities between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions soon flared into armed conflict. In May 1455, just over five months after Henry VI recovered from a bout of mental illness and Richard of York's protectorship had ended, Margaret called for a Great Council from which the Yorkists were excluded. The Council called for an assemblage of the peers at [[Leicester]] to protect the king &quot;against his enemies&quot;. York apparently was prepared for conflict and soon was marching south to meet the Lancastrian army marching north. The Lancastrians suffered a crushing defeat at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on 22 May 1455. Edmund Beaufort (Somerset), the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were killed, Wiltshire fled the battlefield and King Henry was taken prisoner by the victorious Duke of York. In March 1458 along with her husband and leading nobles of the warring factions, she took part in [[The Love Day]] procession in [[London]].

In 1459, hostilities resumed at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]], where [[James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley]], was defeated by a Yorkist army under [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]].

==The Wars of the Roses==

===Early campaigns===
[[File:Margaret of Anjou 1463.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Portrait medallion of Margaret of Anjou, by Piero da Milano, 1463]]
While Margaret was attempting to raise further support for the Lancastrian cause in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; her principal commander, [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset]],&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; gained a major victory for her at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] on 30 December 1460 by defeating the combined armies of the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury. Both men were beheaded and their heads displayed on the gates of the city of York. As Margaret was in Scotland at the time of the battle, it was impossible that she issued the orders for their execution, despite popular belief to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, pp.39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Next was the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] (at which she was present) on 17 February 1461.&lt;ref name=&quot;costain305&quot;/&gt; In this battle, she defeated the Yorkist forces of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], and recaptured her husband. After this battle, she ordered the execution of two Yorkist [[prisoners of war]], [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], the rival of the loyal Lancastrian, the Earl of Devon, and [[Sir Thomas Kyriell]]. Both men had kept watch over King Henry, a prisoner to Warwick, to keep him out of harm's way during the battle. The king had promised the two knights immunity, but Margaret gainsaid him and ordered their execution by decapitation. It is alleged that she put the men on trial with her son presiding. &quot;Fair son&quot;, she allegedly asked, &quot;what death shall these knights die?&quot; Prince Edward replied that their heads should be cut off, despite the king's pleas for mercy.&lt;ref name=&quot;costain305&quot;&gt;Costain, p.305.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sojourn in France===
The Lancastrian army was beaten at the [[Battle of Towton]] on 29 March 1461 by the son of the late Duke of York, the future [[Edward IV of England]], who deposed King Henry and proclaimed himself king. Margaret was determined to win back her son's inheritance and fled with him into Wales and later Scotland. Finding her way to France, she made an ally of her cousin, King [[Louis XI of France]], and at his instigation she allowed an approach from Edward's former supporter, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who had fallen out with his former friend as a result of Edward's marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]], and was now seeking revenge for the loss of his political influence. Warwick's daughter, [[Anne Neville]], was married to Margaret's son Edward, Prince of Wales, in order to cement the alliance, and Margaret insisted that Warwick return to England to prove himself before she followed. He did so, restoring Henry VI briefly to the throne on 3 October 1470.

===Final defeat at Tewkesbury===

By the time Margaret, her son and daughter-in-law (Anne) were ready to follow Warwick back to England, the tables had again turned in favour of the Yorkists, and the Earl was defeated and killed by the returning King Edward IV in the [[Battle of Barnet]] on 14 April 1471. Margaret was forced to lead her own army at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] on 4 May 1471, at which the Lancastrian forces were defeated and her seventeen-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster]] was killed. The circumstances of Edward's death have never been made clear; it is not known whether he was killed in the actual fighting or executed after the battle by the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]]. Over the previous ten years, Margaret had gained a reputation for aggression and ruthlessness, but following her defeat at Tewkesbury and the death of her only son, she was completely broken in spirit. After she was taken captive by [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]] at the end of the battle, Margaret was imprisoned by the order of King Edward. She was sent first to [[Wallingford Castle]] and then was transferred to the more secure [[Tower of London]]. Henry VI was also imprisoned in the Tower in the wake of Tewkesbury and he died there on the night of 21 May; the cause of his death is unknown, though [[regicide]] was suspected. In 1472 she was placed in the custody of her former lady-in-waiting [[Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk]], where she remained until ransomed by [[Louis XI]] in 1475.&lt;ref name=&quot;british298&quot;&gt;Hartley, Cathy (2003).

==Final years and death==
Margaret lived in France for seven years as a poor relation of the king. She was hosted by Francis de Vignolles and died, impoverished, in his castle of Dampierre-sur-Loire, near Anjou on 25 August 1482 at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Mary Ann ''[https://archive.org/stream/lifetimesofmarga02hook/lifetimesofmarga02hook#page/n389/mode/1up The life and times of Margaret of Anjou, queen of England and France; and of her father René &quot;the Good,&quot; king of Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem]'', Tinsley brothers eds.

== Margaret's letters ==
Many letters written by Margaret during her tenure as queen consort are still extant. One was written to the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] regarding injuries inflicted on her tenants at the manor of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], which comprised part of her [[Dower|dower lands]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of Queen Margaret of Anjou and Bishop Beckington and Others'', edited by [[Cecil Monro]], Esq., published for the [[Camden Society]], M.DCCC.LXIII, pp.98–98, Google Books, retrieved on 24 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another letter was written to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Monro, pp.99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As the letter was not dated, it is not known which Archbishop this was; Munro suggests it was most likely to have been either [[John Stafford (bishop)|John Stafford]], (13 May 1443 – 25 May 1452) or Cardinal [[John Kemp]], (21 July 1452 – 22 March 1454).&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret's letters, which typically began with the words &quot;By the Quene,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Monro, pp.89–165&lt;/ref&gt; are compiled in a book edited by [[Cecil Monro]], which was published for the [[Camden Society]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PR8IAAAAIAAJ Letters of Queen Margaret of Anjou and Bishop Beckington, and Others]'', edited by [[Cecil Monro]], Esq., published for the [[Camden Society]], M.DCCC.LXIII, Google Books, retrieved on 24 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret is a major character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Shakespearean history|first tetralogy]] of History plays. ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2|Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 3|Part 3]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. She is the only character to appear alive in all four plays, but due to the length of the plays many of her lines are usually cut in modern adaptations.&lt;ref name=margaretplay&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45356908 |title=Bringing Shakespeare's neglected women out of the shadows|website=BBC News|date=20 September 2018  |author=Ian Youngs |accessdate= 20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare portrays Margaret as an intelligent, ruthless woman who easily dominates her husband and fiercely vies for power with her enemies. In ''Henry VI, Part 2'' Margaret has an affair with the Duke of Suffolk and mourns his death by carrying around his severed head. In ''Henry VI, Part 3'' she personally stabs the Duke of York on the battlefield after humiliatingly taunting him, and becomes suicidal when her son Edward is killed in front of her. Although in reality, Margaret spent the rest of her life outside England after the death of her husband and son, Shakespeare has her return to the court in ''Richard III''. Margaret serves as a [[Cassandra]]-like prophetess; in her first appearance she dramatically curses the majority of the nobles for their roles in the downfall of the House of Lancaster. All of her curses come to pass as the noblemen are betrayed and executed by Richard of Gloucester, and each character reflects on her curse before his execution. Shakespeare had famously described Margaret: &quot;How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex/ To triumph like an Amazonian trull/ Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castor |first1=Helen |date=2011 |title= She-Wolves: The Women Who Ruled England Before Elizabeth |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=31|isbn=978-0-06-143076-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1963 production by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] of [[The Wars of the Roses (adaptation)|The Wars of the Roses]], broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1965 and 1966, Margaret was played by [[Peggy Ashcroft]]. In the second series of ''[[The Hollow Crown (TV series)|The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses]]'', a three-part television adaptation of the Tetralogy first broadcast in 2016, Margaret was portrayed by [[Sophie Okonedo]].

Margaret's prominence in Shakespeare has led many theatre-makers to interpret the story with her at the center, drawing from the plays she is featured in.

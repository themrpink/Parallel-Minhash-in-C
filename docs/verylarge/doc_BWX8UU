''Prisoner of Azkaban'' reveals more details about the connection between Snape and James. While in school together, Sirius once tricked Snape into almost entering the [[Shrieking Shack]] while Lupin was there, transformed into a werewolf. James realised the danger and stopped Snape, saving his life; this is the incident Dumbledore referred to at the end of the first book. Snape, however, believes James' actions were self-serving, to avoid being expelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs&quot;&gt;{{PA|ch=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''===
Snape's role in the fourth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', is not substantially different from that of the previous three books. He is apoplectic when Harry is unexpectedly entered into the Triwizard Tournament. Later Harry accidentally falls into Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]] and views memories of several [[Death Eater]] trials from years before. At one point, Snape is named as a Death Eater by [[Igor Karkaroff]], but Dumbledore comes to Snape's defence, claiming that although Snape had indeed been a Death Eater, he changed sides before Voldemort's downfall and turned spy against him. Later, Dumbledore assures Harry that Snape's reformation is genuine, though he refuses to tell Harry how he knows this, saying the information &quot;is a matter between Professor Snape and myself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pensieve&quot;&gt;{{GF|ch=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the book, Dumbledore attempts to convince a disbelieving [[Ministry of Magic|Minister for Magic]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], that Voldemort has returned. As proof, Snape willingly shows Fudge the restored [[Dark Mark]] on his arm. He is subsequently sent on a secret mission by Dumbledore. This mission, as had been implied in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and revealed in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', was to rejoin the Death Eaters and spy on Voldemort as a [[Double agent#Re-doubled agent|re-doubled agent]], while pretending to spy on Dumbledore on behalf of Voldemort.

===''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''===
[[Image:Young Severus Snape.jpg|thumb|left|Teenage Severus Snape ([[Alec Hopkins]]) in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'']]
In the fifth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Snape returns to a more prominent role. With Voldemort having returned to a fully corporeal body, Snape continues working as a re-doubled agent for Dumbledore.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Seer Overheard&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen prior to the start of school at [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] giving reports to the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place&quot;&gt;{{OotP|ch=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a very strained relationship with Sirius, who owns Grimmauld Place and must remain there in hiding. The two trade frequent snide remarks and at one point almost begin a duel. Snape taunts Sirius about the latter's not being able to take an active role in the Order's missions because of his fugitive status. Harry feels later that this taunting contributed to Sirius' willingness to take unsafe risks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occlumency&quot;&gt;{{OotP|ch=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back at school, Snape's allegiance to the Order has no effect on his dislike for Harry.

Later in the book, Dumbledore has Snape teach Harry [[Occlumency]], the protection of the mind from outside intrusion or influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occlumency&quot; /&gt; The sessions are made difficult by their mutual hostility and end prematurely when Harry uses Dumbledore's Pensieve to view one of Snape's worst childhood memories without the latter's permission. He sees the memory of Snape being [[bullying|bullied]] by James and Sirius, and of calling Harry's mother Lily a [[Mudblood]] (a highly offensive term).&lt;ref name=&quot;Snape's Worst Memory&quot; /&gt; Only in the final book is it revealed that, prior to this confrontation, Snape and Lily had been close friends.

Towards the end of the novel, [[Dolores Umbridge]] – the school's politically appointed headmistress – captures Harry and interrogates him about Dumbledore's whereabouts. She sends for Snape, demanding that he provide the magical truth serum [[Veritaserum]] in order to force Harry to reveal any information he may be hiding. Snape claims that his supplies of the serum have been exhausted after Umbridge tries to use the drug previously on Harry. It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. Snape then carries Harry's cryptic warning about Sirius' capture to the other Order members, allowing them to come to the rescue in the [[Department of Mysteries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lost Prophecy&quot;&gt;{{OotP|ch=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius' death, believing Snape's goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.

===''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''===
In the second chapter of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]] visit Snape at his home in [[Spinner's End]]. Narcissa's son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] has been given a difficult task by Voldemort, and Narcissa swears Snape to an [[Unbreakable Vow]] that he will protect Draco, help him complete Voldemort's task, and finish the task himself if Draco fails. When questioned by Bellatrix about his loyalties, Snape says he has been working for Voldemort ever since Voldemort's return, and explains his actions in the previous books in that light. He points out that gaining Dumbledore's trust and protection has kept him out of Azkaban and free to operate on Voldemort's behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinner's End&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start-of-term feast at Hogwarts, Dumbledore announces Snape as the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. [[Horace Slughorn]], a former teacher who himself had taught Snape during his Hogwarts years, comes out of retirement and replaces him as Potions Master. With Snape no longer teaching Potions, Harry enrolls in Slughorn's class and is lent an old textbook until his new one arrives. Harry finds [[marginalia]], including a variety of hexes and jinxes seemingly invented by an unknown student, and substantial improvements to the book's standard potion-making instructions. The text is inscribed as being &quot;the Property of the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. The notes greatly bolster Harry's performance in Potions, so much so that he impresses Slughorn. Snape, who maintains that he &quot;never had the impression that [he] had been able to teach Potter anything at all&quot;, is suspicious of Harry's newfound Potions success.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Unbreakable Vow&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during a fight with Draco, Harry casts one of the Prince's spells marked &quot;For Enemies,&quot; and is horrified by the devastating wounds it inflicts to Draco's face and chest. Snape rushes to the scene and heals Draco, then interrogates Harry regarding the spell, using [[Legilimency]] to extract the source of Harry's knowledge (the Potions textbook) from Harry's mind. When Snape insists that Harry show him his Potions textbook, Harry hides the Prince's book and gives him [[Ron Weasley]]'s book instead. As punishment for the attack and knowing Harry is lying about the textbook, Snape assigns Harry detention during the final [[Quidditch]] match of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sectumsempra&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving Hogwarts to accompany Dumbledore in locating another [[horcrux]] – part of Voldemort's soul – Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney that it was Snape who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's [[Horcrux]], Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lightning-Struck Tower&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry, who is paralysed under his [[Cloak of Invisibility (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]] by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; (being the [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] son of Muggle Tobias Snape and [[Pure-blood (Harry Potter)|pure-blood]] Eileen {{em|Prince}}). Snape passes through the school gates and [[Disapparition|Disapparates]] with Draco in tow at the book's end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight of the Prince&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that at this point in the series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become &quot;as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-1.htm |title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part One |author=[[Melissa Anelli]] and [[Emerson Spartz]] |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |date=16 July 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''===
In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Voldemort and his Death Eaters have tightened their grip on the wizarding world. Snape is named Headmaster of Hogwarts, while Death Eaters [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]] are appointed as [[Hogwarts staff]]. The novel focuses largely on Harry and his friends and events outside the school; therefore Snape plays a limited role at the start. In the course of the book, Harry and his friends find out that a few students attempted to steal the [[Sword of Godric Gryffindor]], and that Snape subsequently sent it to be stored at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]; however, that sword was only a copy. Later on, Harry and Ron are led to find the real sword by a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] taking the form of a [[Deer|doe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Silver Doe&quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Towards the end of the book, Harry learns that this was Snape's Patronus, taking the same shape as Harry's mother Lily's Patronus, a visible sign of his lifelong love for Harry's mother, and that Dumbledore had asked Snape to ensure that Harry gained possession of the sword.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt; The novel also reveals that Snape had covertly used his position as Headmaster to protect the students and to contain the Carrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt;)

Towards the end of the school year, Professors [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]], and [[Pomona Sprout|Sprout]] force Snape to flee the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sacking of Severus Snape&quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voldemort summons Snape to the [[Shrieking Shack]]. Erroneously believing Snape is the master of the [[Elder Wand]] and that Snape's death will make him the master of the Wand, Voldemort kills Snape by having his pet snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] bite him through the neck.&lt;ref name=&quot; The Elder Wand &quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dying Snape releases a cloud of memories and tells Harry, who has watched the entire scene from a hidden spot, to take and view them.

From these memories, Harry sees Snape's childhood and learns his true loyalties. In this vision, Harry learns that Snape befriended Lily as a child when they lived near each other. Upon their arrival at Hogwarts, the [[Sorting Hat]] placed Snape and Lily into [[Slytherin]] and [[Gryffindor]] Houses, respectively. They remained friends for the next few years until they were driven apart by Snape's interest in the Dark Arts; the friendship finally ended following the bullying episode that Harry had briefly seen in the fifth book, in which Snape calls Lily &quot;Mudblood&quot;. Despite this separation and Snape's enduring animosity toward Lily's eventual husband James Potter, Snape continued to love Lily for the rest of his life.

The memories also show that as a Death Eater, Snape had revealed to Voldemort a prophecy made by [[Sybill Trelawney]], causing Voldemort to attempt to prevent it by killing Harry and his parents. Snape, who had not realised until too late that [[Voldemort]] had interpreted the prophecy to be referring to Lily and her family (as it could've also referred to the [[Frank and Alice Longbottom]] and their son [[Neville Longbottom]]), asked Voldemort to spare Lily. Still in terror for her life, he also approached Dumbledore, admitted his actions, and begged him to protect the Potters. Dumbledore chided him for thinking only of himself and not of Lily's husband and child, but agreed and ensured that they were placed under the [[Fidelius Charm]]. In return, Snape secretly allied himself with Dumbledore and the [[Order of the Phoenix (fiction)|Order of the Phoenix]] as a [[double agent]] against Voldemort, using his powers of [[Occlumency]] to hide his betrayal from Voldemort. However, Snape demanded of Dumbledore that his love for Lily (his reason for switching sides) be kept a secret, especially from Harry, because of the deep animosity he felt towards Harry's father and his mixed feelings towards Harry (who reminded him of both his love for Lily Potter and her death, and his animosity towards James Potter). Dumbledore agreed and kept the secret throughout his life, although questioning Snape's request to &quot;never reveal the best of you&quot;. Even with his efforts to protect her, Snape felt responsible for Lily's death at Voldemort's hands.

Snape's memories then reveal that Dumbledore had impetuously tried to use the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|Gaunt ring]], which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow the spread of the curse from Dumbledore's hand through his body, but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of ''[[coup de grâce]]'' would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt;

Rowling noted in an interview that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster's office following his death. She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office.&lt;ref name=&quot;leakycauldron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=Transcript of webchat with J.K. Rowling |publisher=the-leaky-cauldron.org |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him one of the most important characters of the seventh book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snape and Dumbledore&quot; /&gt;

====Epilogue====
In the epilogue to ''Deathly Hallows'', set nineteen years after Harry defeats Voldemort, Harry has named his second-born son [[Albus Severus Potter|Albus Severus]], after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. As Albus is about to enter his first year at Hogwarts, he expresses concern that he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry tells his son, &quot;you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them [Snape] was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epilogue&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|&amp;#91;DH&amp;nbsp;Epilogue&amp;#93;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in other material==
===''Harry Potter and the Cursed Child''===

When Draco and [[Astoria Greengrass]]' son [[Scorpius Malfoy]] finds himself in an alternate timeline in which Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, killed Harry and his allies and instituted a terrible reign of terror, he desperately searches for help in restoring history to its original course. He finds that in this reality Snape is still alive and still teaches at Hogwarts, and asks for his help. At first Snape is suspicious of him, since this timeline's version of Scorpius is a bully and a Voldemort stalwart. But when Scorpius shows that he knows of Snape having been in love with Lily, Harry's mother – Snape's most closely guarded secret – Snape becomes convinced that he does indeed come from a different timeline where Harry and his friends won. Snape then reveals that he, together with the fugitive Ron and [[Hermione Granger]], maintain the last remnants of [[Dumbledore's Army]] – still waging hopeless resistance against the all-powerful Voldemort. In talking with Scorpius, Snape had learned that Harry would name his son &quot;Albus Severus&quot; and would regard Snape as &quot;probably the bravest man I ever knew&quot; – and is deeply moved. Though having guessed that in the other timeline he would die, Snape nevertheless willingly helps Scorpius recreate this timeline – and being discovered by [[Dementor]]s, Snape sacrifices himself in order to cover Scorpius' escape.

==Portrayal in films==
Severus Snape appears in all eight ''Harry Potter'' films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/videos-first-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-ii-abc-family-preview-80278/|title=UPDATED Videos: First Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II ABC Family preview - SnitchSeeker.com|website=www.snitchseeker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed by British actor [[Alan Rickman]]. Rickman was Rowling's personal choice to portray the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The First Look at Harry |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001148-3,00.html |author=Jess Cagle |publisher=time.com |date=5 November 2001 |accessdate=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had conversations with Rowling about his character and is one of the few ''Harry Potter'' actors that she spoke to prior to the completion of the book series about the future direction of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=JK Rowling interview in full |publisher=[[CBBC]] |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_1634000/1634994.stm |accessdate=29 July 2007 | date=2 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He knew very early on that he'd been in love with Lily,&quot; said Rowling. &quot;He needed to understand […] where this bitterness towards this boy who's the living example of her preference for another man came from.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterCast&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Anelli, Melissa, John Noe and Sue Upton. &quot;PotterCast Interviews J.K.

Rickman used this knowledge of Snape's ultimate loyalties throughout the films to decide how to play certain scenes, deliver specific lines, or use body language to convey specific emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;herocomplex.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title='Harry Potter': Alan Rickman looks back on decade of dark magic|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/harry-potter-alan-rickman-looks-back-on-decade-of-dark-magic/|work=Hero Complex|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the directors of the films would ask him why he was doing a scene a certain way or delivering a line in a specific manner, Rickman would simply reply that he knew something they didn't.&lt;ref name=&quot;herocomplex.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Rickman himself refrained from talking about Snape, asking readers to wait and &quot;see what unfolds&quot; in the course of the novels; however, he did say Snape is a complicated person, very rigid and full of himself; in an interview he went further, saying: &quot;Snape isn't one who enjoys jokes and I strongly fear that his sense of humour is extremely limited... But in his defence, I will add that he didn't have an easy adolescence, particularly during his studies at Hogwarts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interviews Transcripts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Alan Rickman Interviews Transcripts about Snape |url= http://whysnape.tripod.com/rickman.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said Snape is a fascinating character, and that he takes immense pleasure in playing such an ambiguous person.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Interview Translation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Alan Rickman – French Interview Translation |url= http://whysnape.tripod.com/rickmanfrench.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickman's performance as Snape was widely acclaimed by critics, fans and Rowling herself. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' listed Rickman as one of the most popular movie stars in 2007 for his performance as Snape, saying: &quot;As the icy, humourless magic instructor Severus Snape, Rickman may not be on screen long—but he owns every minute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The movie stars we're loving right now |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043289_20043293_20043278_3,00.html |magazine=EW.com |accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickman also noted fans' reactions; in an interview, he said he found &quot;that people in general adore Snape. He is sarcastic, stubborn, etc, etc. But he is also fascinating. I have a lot of fun impersonating him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;French Interview Translation&quot; /&gt; Rickman was nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Snape, and in 2011, was elected the best character portrayal in all the ''Harry Potter'' films series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/14/us-harrypotter-poll-idUSTRE76D1FC20110714 | work=Reuters | first=Jill | last=Serjeant | title=Snape voted greatest &quot;Potter&quot; character in MTV poll | date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] published an open letter from Rickman to J.K. Rowling, ruminating on the ten years of working on the Potter films and thanking her for telling the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffkatz.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a721c2d7970b0154329054d6970c-800wi|title=jeffkatz.typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', the fifteen-year-old Snape (portrayed by [[Alec Hopkins]]) makes a brief appearance in a flashback to Snape's youth. In the final film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', the younger Snape, perhaps ten or eleven, is played by Benedict Clarke. In 2016, a [[fan film]] prequel, ''[[Severus Snape and the Marauders]]'', was released online and Snape was played by Mick Ignis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fraser Mcalpine |title=Harry Potter Fan Film 'Severus Snape and the Marauders' |publisher=BBC America |date=4 August 2017 |url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/07/watch-harry-potter-fan-film-severus-snape-and-the-marauders/ |accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Alan Rickman was offered the role of Severus Snape, the role was originally offered to [[Tim Roth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shawn Adler |title=What Would &quot;Potter&quot; Have Been Like With Tim Roth As Snape? |publisher=MTV |date=7 December 2007 |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/12/07/what-would-potter-have-been-like-with-tim-roth-as-snape/ |accessdate=8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who turned the role down in favour of portraying General Thade in ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'' episode 776: &quot;Tim Roth&quot;. 23 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterisation==

===Outward appearance===
Snape is described as a thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose, and yellow, uneven teeth. He has shoulder-length, greasy black hair which frames his face, and cold, black eyes. He wears black, flowing robes which give him the appearance of &quot;an overgrown bat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Potions Master&quot;&gt;{{PStone|ch=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youthful Snape had a &quot;stringy, pallid look&quot;, being &quot;round-shouldered yet angular&quot;, having a &quot;twitchy&quot; walk &quot;that recalled a spider&quot; and &quot;long oily hair that jumped about his face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snape's Worst Memory&quot; /&gt;

In the chapter illustrations by [[Mary GrandPré]] in the American editions of ''The Prisoner of Azkaban'', ''The Order of the Phoenix'', and ''The Half-Blood Prince'', Snape is depicted with a moustache and [[goatee]], long black hair, and a receding hairline.

===Personality===
Snape is generally depicted as being cold, calculating, precise, sarcastic, and bitter. He strongly dislikes Harry and often insults him by insulting his father James. As the series progresses, it is revealed that his treatment of Harry stems from Snape's bitter rivalry with James when they were in school together. In particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused the already lonely boy to further &quot;shut himself in&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Interview Translation&quot; /&gt; Rowling further described the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: &quot;Given his time over again [Snape] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.[...] [He] was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought [Lily] would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomsbury chat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Web Chat with J.K. Rowling 30 July 2007 on Bloomsbury.com |url= http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/pdfs/webchat-jkr.pdf |accessdate=2 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135035/http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/pdfs/webchat-jkr.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adult Snape, on the other hand, is portrayed as very self-assured and confident of his abilities, to a degree that Rickman described as &quot;full of himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interviews Transcripts&quot; /&gt; Director [[David Yates]] said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Yates&quot;/&gt; Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely at a loss for words or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused of cowardice. His otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occlumency&quot; /&gt;

Like some other prominent members of Slytherin house, Snape is shown to be a clever and cunning wizard.&lt;ref name=&quot; The Elder Wand &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Padfoot Returns&quot;/&gt; He is intelligent and has a keen, analytical mind. In an interview, Rowling adds that Snape is immensely brave,&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Chapter&quot; /&gt; and when asked if she considers Snape a hero, replied: &quot;Yes, I do; though a very flawed hero. An [[anti-hero]], perhaps. He is not a particularly likeable man in many ways. He remains rather cruel, a bully, riddled with bitterness and insecurity—and yet he loved, and showed loyalty to that love and, ultimately, laid down his life because of it. That's pretty heroic!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomsbury chat&quot; /&gt;

===Magical abilities and skills===
All seven novels show Snape to be a very powerful wizard and to have been outstanding while a student. He specialises in potion making and has talent and passion for the Dark Arts. Sirius claimed that Snape knew more hexes and curses as a first-year student at Hogwarts than most seventh-years knew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Padfoot Returns&quot;&gt;{{GF|ch=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly gifted in potion making, Snape added major improvements to his Potions textbook while still a student. Also as a student, Snape shows a rare gift for discovering new spells. Lupin describes [[Sectumsempra]] as Snape's &quot;speciality&quot; in ''Deathly Hallows.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallen Warrior&quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snape is shown using this spell as a teenager against Harry's father James&lt;ref name=&quot;Snape's Worst Memory&quot; /&gt; and in the aerial battle in the last novel when he accidentally hits [[George Weasley]] (acting as a Potter decoy) with it while actually aiming for a Death Eater who was trying to attack Lupin, permanently severing George's right ear. Despite Sectumsempra's deadly power, Snape can also heal the wounds it causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sectumsempra&quot; /&gt; Snape is adept at reversing or containing potentially fatal damage from other dark curses as well, due to his vast knowledge of Dark Arts, as he does when Dumbledore&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt; and then [[Katie Bell (Harry Potter)|Katie Bell]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Secret Riddle&quot;&gt;{{HBP|ch=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; are cursed. Skil&lt;!-- Yes, there is only one 'l' in skilful in British English, which we use in this page--&gt;ful in the arts of [[Legilimency]] and especially [[Occlumency]], Snape is able to both access the minds of others and protect his own thoughts—indeed, though Snape does not care for the term himself, Harry forms the uncomfortable impression early in the series that the Potions Master is able to &quot;read minds.&quot; Being an Occlumens, Snape is able to keep his betrayal from Voldemort, who is himself described as being &quot;the greatest Legilimens&quot; in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinner's End&quot; /&gt; According to Rowling, Snape is the only Death Eater capable of producing a full [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which, like Lily's, is a doe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomsbury chat&quot; /&gt; Snape is a talented duellist, able to hold off by himself (if only briefly) a group of three Hogwarts professors that included former duelling champion [[Filius Flitwick]]. Professor McGonagall later implies that Snape learned to fly without the use of a broom, a rare skill previously displayed only by Voldemort.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sacking of Severus Snape&quot; /&gt;

===Family===
Snape's family background is mostly shown in flashbacks during the course of the last three novels. Snape was born to [[Eileen Prince]], a witch, and Tobias Snape, a Muggle, making him a half-blood (hence the name, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;). This is rare for a Death Eater, as remarked in the last book, though Voldemort himself also had a Muggle father. Snape spent his early childhood living with his parents in a small house in [[Spinner's End]]. Snape's family was a poor one and he is described as wearing ill-fitting clothes &quot;that were so mis-matched that it looked deliberate&quot;. As a child, Snape was apparently neglected and his parents often fought with one another. Snape was very eager to leave his home to go to Hogwarts.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt; Towards the end of the last novel, Harry draws parallels between his childhood, Snape's, and Voldemort's.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Forest Again&quot;&gt;{{DH|ch=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalties===
Snape's true loyalty was one of the most significant questions in the series up until the end of the final instalment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. Although the first five novels depict him as unfair and vindictive towards Harry and his friends, he invariably ends up protecting or otherwise helping them when they or their allies are in danger. Several characters express doubts about his loyalty, but Dumbledore's trust in him is generally taken to be the final word. The sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', departs from that model. In the second chapter, Snape claims to have been working for Voldemort ever since the latter's return, and only pretending to help Dumbledore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinner's End&quot;/&gt; By killing Dumbledore toward the end of the novel, Snape seems to place himself firmly in Voldemort's camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lightning-Struck Tower&quot;/&gt; Rowling maintains this impression through the early chapters of the seventh novel. However, near the climax of the book, Snape leaves Harry his dying thoughts (to be viewed in the Pensieve) and ultimately reveals to Harry that he had been loyal to Albus Dumbledore throughout the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; /&gt; Snape's fierce devotion to and love of his childhood friend Lily, Harry's mother, is the foundation of that loyalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Prince's Tale&quot;/&gt;

After ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Snape's loyalty was a matter of intense debate among the fans. The issue was given special attention in the marketing campaigns on behalf of the last book, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. &quot;Is Snape Good or Evil?&quot; was one of the questions in [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Inc]].'s seven-question series, part of its marketing campaign for the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Scholastic asks &quot;Is Snape Good or Evil?&quot; |url= http://www.hpana.com/news.19880.html |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Waldenbooks]] marketing campaign, two free stickers, one that said &quot;Trust Snape&quot; and another that stated &quot;Snape Is A Very Bad Man&quot; were available with the book. [[Borders Group]] published a separate book on the topic, ''The Great Snape Debate,'' containing essays and arguments from both sides of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Severus Snape: Friend or Foe? |url= http://www.bordersmedia.com/harrypotter/snapepanel/default.asp |accessdate=18 March 2008}} Link includes video.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Great Snape Debate – Borders Exclusive |url= http://www.bordersstores.com/search/title_detail.jsp?id=56815939 |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The secretive attitude and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with [[Stephen Fry]], the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: &quot;Most characters like Snape are hard to love but there is a sort of ambiguity—you can't quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it's fascinating when you think he's going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he's not so bad after all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Albert 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Stephen Fry at Royal Albert Hall |url= http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm |year=2003 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Yates]], who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: &quot;A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;David Yates&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Director 'denies' Potter audience... just a little| url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19734081/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717131212/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19734081/| url-status=dead| archive-date=17 July 2007|date=13 July 2007 |accessdate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book Festival&quot;/&gt; Joyce Millman suggests in her essay &quot;To Sir with Love&quot; in the book ''Mapping the World of Harry Potter'', that Snape is derived from a tradition of [[Byronic hero]]es such as ''Wuthering Heights''{{'}} [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mapping the World of Harry Potter|editor=Mercedes Lackey |publisher=BenBella Books, Inc. |year=2006|pages=39–52 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sKRkzVIK3foC&amp;q=snape++wuthering-heights+byronic+snape&amp;pg=PT13 |accessdate=30 July 2008 | isbn=978-1-932100-59-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jenny Sawyer from ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' commented on the character's development in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenny Sawyer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Missing from 'Harry Potter' |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0725/p09s02-coop.html?page=1 |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that Snape is the only [[protagonist]] who genuinely has a choice to make and who struggles to do the right thing, hence the only one to face a &quot;compelling inner crisis&quot;. She believed the popularity of the character is due to the moral journey and inner conflict that Snape undergoes within the series, as it is the hero's struggle and costly redemption that really matter: &quot;[Snape's] character ached for resolution. And it is precisely this need for resolution—our desire to know the real Snape and to understand his choices—that makes him the most compelling character in the Potter epic.&quot;

The final revelation of Snape's loyalty in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' was viewed positively by fans and critics alike. [[Daniel Radcliffe]], who portrays Harry Potter in the movie series, expressed his delight, saying he was pleased to see that his theory that Snape would end up being a sort of [[tragic hero]] came through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Daniel Radcliffe Talks 'Deathly Hallows' |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20044270_20044274_20048635,00.html |author=Steve Daly |magazine=EW.com |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Hand]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, &quot;The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of &quot;Deathly Hallows,&quot; but when he does the book becomes his: Snape's fate, more than Voldemort's, perhaps more even than Harry's, is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Harry's Final Fantasy: Last Time's the Charm |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/21/AR2007072101025.html |author=Elizabeth Hand |work=Washington Post |date=22 July 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The character of Severus Snape has appeared in various animated [[parodies of Harry Potter]]. He is a starring character in [[Neil Cicierega]]'s online ''[[Potter Puppet Pals]]'' parodies, and has a centric episode titled ''Bothering Snape''. Also, the video ''The Mysterious Ticking Noise'' with the chorus &quot;Snape, Snape, Severus Snape&quot; was the winner for &quot;Best Comedy&quot; of the year 2007 at YouTube; it currently has over 170 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= PotterPuppetPals Top at YouTube Awards |url= http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/3/22/tic-tock-potterpuppetpals-top-at-youtube-awards |publisher=the-leaky-cauldron.org |date=22 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snape is also parodied as Professor Santory Snapekin in [[Sluggy Freelance]]'s webcomic entitled ''Torg Potter''. In the first parody, Torg defeats a plot by Professor Snapekin to achieve ultimate power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Torg Potter and the Sorcerer's Nuts |url=http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=030915 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922090613/http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=030915 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 September 2003 |accessdate=18 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which [[Lindsay Lohan]] appears as Hermione Granger, Snape is portrayed by [[Will Forte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saturday Night Live Transcripts |url= http://snltranscripts.jt.org/03/03rpotter.phtml |accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snape has also been parodied in UK television.

[[File:Savile Club New Bar 2.JPG|thumb|250px|The bar at the [[Savile Club]] in [[London]]]] 
A '''club''' is an [[voluntary association|association]] of people united by a common interest or goal. A [[service club]], for example, exists for voluntary or charitable activities. There are clubs devoted to hobbies and sports, social activities clubs, political and religious clubs, and so forth.

== History ==
[[File:Carlton-Club.jpg|thumb|Historical image of [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] with the [[Carlton Club]], describing itself as the &quot;oldest, and most important of all Conservative clubs&quot;]]
Historically, clubs occurred in all ancient states of which we have detailed knowledge. Once people started living together in larger groups, there was need for people with a common interest to be able to associate despite having no ties of kinship. Organizations of the sort have existed for many years, as evidenced by [[Ancient Greek clubs]] and associations (''[[collegia]]'') in [[Ancient Rome]].

=== Origins of the word and concept ===
It is uncertain whether the use of the word &quot;club&quot; originated in its meaning of a knot of people, or from the fact that the members &quot;clubbed&quot; together to pay the expenses of their gatherings. The oldest English clubs were merely informal periodic gatherings of friends for the purpose of dining or drinking with one another. [[Thomas Occleve]] (in the time of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]) mentions such a club called ''La Court de Bonne Compagnie'' (the Court of Good Company), of which he was a member. In 1659 [[John Aubrey]] wrote, &quot;We now use the word clubbe for a sodality [a society, association, or fraternity of any kind] in a  tavern.&quot;

=== In Shakespeare's day ===
Of early clubs the most famous, latterly, was the [[Bread Street]] or Friday Street Club that met at the [[Mermaid Tavern]] on the first Friday of each month. [[John Selden]], [[John Donne]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]
and [[Francis Beaumont]] were among the members (although it is often asserted that [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] were members of this club, there is no documented evidence to support this claim). Another such club, founded by [[Ben Jonson]], met at the Devil Tavern near [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], also in [[London]].

=== Coffee houses ===
{{main|Coffeehouse}}
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
The word “club,” in the sense of an association to promote good-fellowship and social intercourse, became common in England at the time of ''[[Tatler (1709)|Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' (1709–1712). With the introduction of coffee-drinking in the middle of the 17th century, clubs entered on a more permanent phase. The coffee houses of the later [[Stuart period]] are the real originals of the modern clubhouse. The clubs of the late 17th and early 18th century type resembled their [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] forerunners in being oftenest associations solely for conviviality or literary coteries. But many were confessedly political, e.g. The Rota, or Coffee Club (1659), a [[debating society]] for the spread of republican ideas, broken up at [[the Restoration]] in 1660, the [[Calves Head Club]] (c.1693) and the [[Green Ribbon Club]] (1675). The characteristics of all these clubs were:

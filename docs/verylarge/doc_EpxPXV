Writers and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including &lt;!-- Please don't add more pop-culture examples of cloaking devices. This article is about the real-world development, not a crufty list comprising every game they've ever appeared in! A link to this article doesn't necessitate a reciprocal link. --&gt;''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', and ''[[Stargate]]''.

==Scientific experimentation==
An operational, [[non-fiction]]al cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually [[infrared]]), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as &quot;[[active camouflage]]&quot;. Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the 'cloaked' object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Robert F. |last1=Service | first2= Adrian |last2= Cho |title= Strange New Tricks With Light |journal= Science |pages= 1622 |volume= 330 |date= 17 December 2010|bibcode = 2010Sci...330.1622S |doi=10.1126/science.330.6011.1622 |issue=6011 |pmid=21163994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metamaterial research===
{{main|Metamaterial cloaking}}
Optical [[metamaterial]]s have featured in several recent proposals for invisibility schemes. &quot;Metamaterials&quot; refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using [[transformation optics]] it is possible to design the optical parameters of a &quot;cloak&quot; so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;pendry2006controlling&quot;&gt;

These spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using [[metamaterials]]. There are several [[theories of cloaking]], giving rise to different types of invisibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;inami2003optical&quot;&gt;

In 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial.  This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating.  When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David R. |title= A cloaking coating for murky media |journal=Science|pages= 384–385 |volume= 345 |issue= 6195 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1256753|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..384S |pmid=25061192|s2cid= 206559590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schittny, Robert et cl. |title= Invisibility cloaking in a diffuse light scattering medium |journal=Science|pages= 427–429 |volume= 345 |issue= 6195 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1254524|pmid= 24903561 |bibcode = 2014Sci...345..427S |s2cid= 206557843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Active camouflage ===

''[[Active camouflage]]'' (or ''adaptive camouflage'') is a group of [[camouflage]] technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.

''Optical camouflage'' is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion.  The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.

It has been reported that the [[British Army]] has tested an invisible tank.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Josh. [http://science.howstuffworks.com/invisible-tank.htm &quot;Is the army testing an invisible tank?&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301121221/http://science.howstuffworks.com/invisible-tank.htm |date=2012-03-01 }}, ''HowStuffWorks.com'', 3 December 2007. accessed 22 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plasma stealth===
{{Main|Plasma stealth}}
[[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990sri..reptQ....V Plasma cloaking: Air chemistry, broadband absorption, and plasma generation] [http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html backup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802184503/http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html |date=2009-08-02 }}, February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defense Technical Information Center]] is also following up research on plasma reducing [[Radar cross-section|RCS]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Gregoire, D.

W.[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA250710 Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802062206/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA250710 |date=2009-08-02 }} [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA250710&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Electromagnetic-Wave Propagation in Unmagnetized Plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802062201/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA250710&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |date=2009-08-02 }}, March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  A plasma cloaking device was patented in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, John R. &quot;Microwave absorption system&quot; {{US patent|4989006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metascreen===
A prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few [[micrometers]] thick and to a limited extent can hide [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer's positions. It was prepared at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] by Professor [[Andrea Alù]].&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|work=PhysicsWorld.com|date=28 March 2013|title=Ultrathin &quot;metascreen&quot; forms latest invisibility cloak|author=Tim Wogan|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817232220/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|archivedate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a [[fishing net]].  In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt;  The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt; The same researchers published a paper on &quot;[[Theories of cloaking#Plasmonic cover|plasmonic cloaking]]&quot; the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630 New Journal of Physics, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Howell/Choi cloaking device ===
University of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the &quot;[[Rochester Cloak]]&quot;. The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the [[optical pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cloaking' device uses ordinary lenses to hide objects across range of angles| work = Science Daily| publisher = Science Daily| date = 29 September 2014| url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| accessdate = 29 September 2014| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141001000527/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| url-status =dead| archivedate =2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloaking in mechanics===
The concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object &quot;invisible&quot; to sound or even hides it from touching.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bückmann | first = Tiemo | year = 2014 | title = An elasto-mechanical unfeelability cloak made of pentamode metamaterials | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 5 | issue = 4130 | pages = 4130 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms5130 | pmid = 24942191 | bibcode = 2014NatCo...5.4130B | df =  | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistic typology topics}}

In [[linguistic typology]], an '''analytic language''' is a language that primarily conveys relationships between words in sentences by way of ''helper'' words ([[Grammatical particle|particles]], [[preposition]]s, etc.) and word order, as opposed to utilizing [[inflection]]s (changing the form of a word to convey its role in the sentence). For example, the English-language phrase &quot;The cat chases the ball&quot; conveys the fact that the cat is acting on the ball ''analytically'' via word order. This can be contrasted to [[synthetic language]]s, which rely heavily on inflections to convey word relationships (e.g., the phrases &quot;The cat chase''s'' the ball&quot; and &quot;The cat chase''d'' the ball&quot; convey different time frames via changing the form of the word ''chase''). Most languages are not purely analytic, but many rely primarily on analytic syntax.

Typically, analytic languages have a low [[morpheme]]-per-[[word]] ratio, especially with respect to [[Morpheme#Inflectional_morphemes|inflectional morpheme]]s. A grammatical construction can similarly be ''analytic'' if it uses [[bound morphemes|unbound morphemes]], which are separate words, or [[word order]]. Analytic languages rely more heavily on the use of definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which tend to be less prominently used or absent in strongly synthetic languages; stricter word order; various [[preposition]]s, [[postposition]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]],  and [[modifier (linguistics)|modifiers]]; and [[context (language use)|context]].

==Background==
The term ''analytic'' is commonly used in [[synthetic language#Synthetic and analytic languages|a relative rather than an absolute sense]]. The currently most prominent and widely used [[Indo-European]] analytic language is [[modern English]], which has lost much of the [[inflectional morphology]] inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Germanic]], and [[Old English]] over the centuries and has not gained any new inflectional morphemes in the meantime, making it more analytic than most other Indo-European languages. 

For example, while Proto-Indo-European had much more complex [[grammatical conjugation]], [[grammatical gender]]s, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] and inflections for eight or nine [[Grammatical case|cases]] in its nouns, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, [[participle]]s, [[postposition]]s and [[determiner]]s, standard English has lost nearly all of them (except for three modified cases for [[pronoun]]s) along with genders and dual number and simplified its conjugation.

[[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] are [[synthetic languages]].  [[Russian grammar#Nouns|Nouns in Russian]] inflect for at least six cases, most of them descended from Proto-Indo-European cases, whose functions English translates using other strategies like [[preposition]]s, [[Voice (grammar)|verbal voice]], word order, and [[English_possessive|possessive ''{{'s}}'']] instead.

[[Modern Hebrew]] is much more analytic than [[Classical Hebrew]] &quot;both with nouns and with verbs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 50-51 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf &quot;Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns&quot;], ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2, pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isolating language==
A related concept is the [[isolating language]], which is about a low number of any type of morphemes per word, taking into account [[Morpheme#Derivational_morphemes|derivational morpheme]]s as well. A purely isolating language would be analytic by necessity and lack inflectional morphemes by definition. However, the reverse is not necessarily true, and a language can have derivational morphemes but lack inflectional morphemes.  For example, [[Mandarin Chinese]] has many [[compound word]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Li, Charles and Thompson, Sandra A., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F60wDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=isolating%20OR%20analytic&amp;f=false Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar]'', University of California Press, 1981, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; giving it a moderately high ratio of morphemes per word, but since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships, it is a very analytic language.

English is not totally analytic in its nouns since it does use inflections for number (e.g., &quot;one day, three days; one boy, four boys&quot;) and possession (&quot;The boy's ball&quot; vs. &quot;The boy has a ball&quot;).  Mandarin Chinese, in contrast, has no inflections on its nouns: compare {{lang|zh|一天}} ''yī tiān'' &quot;one day&quot;, {{lang|zh|三天}} ''sān tiān'' &quot;three days&quot; (literally &quot;three day&quot;); {{lang|zh|一个男孩}} ''yī ge nánhái'' &quot;one boy&quot; (lit. &quot;one [entity of] male child&quot;), {{lang|zh|四个男孩}} ''sì ge nánhái'' &quot;four boys&quot; (lit. &quot;four [entity of] male child&quot;).  Instead, English is considered to be weakly inflected, and comparatively more analytic than most other [[Indo-European languages]].

'''Charles Edward Anderson Berry''' (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist, and one of the pioneers of [[rock and roll]] music. Nicknamed the &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Father of Rock and Roll]]&quot;, Berry refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as &quot;[[Maybellene]]&quot; (1955), &quot;[[Roll Over Beethoven]]&quot; (1956), &quot;[[Rock and Roll Music]]&quot; (1957) and &quot;[[Johnny B. Goode]]&quot; (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/chuck-berry-father-rock-n-roll-dies-90-missouri-police-n699311|title=Chuck Berry, father of rock 'n' roll, dies at 90|website=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]], Berry was a major influence on subsequent [[rock music]].&lt;ref name=Campbell2008p168&gt;Campbell, M. (ed.) (2008). ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On''. 3rd ed. Cengage Learning. pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Born into a middle-class [[African-American]] family in [[St. Louis]], Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]]. While still a high school student he was convicted of [[armed robbery]] and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar [[riff]]s and showmanship techniques of the blues musician [[T-Bone Walker]], Berry began performing with the [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson Trio]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9078885#cite|title=Chuck Berry |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met [[Muddy Waters]], who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]], of [[Chess Records]]. With Chess, he recorded &quot;Maybellene&quot;—Berry's adaptation of the country song &quot;[[Ida Red]]&quot;—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on ''Billboard'' magazine's rhythm and blues chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7728700/chuck-berry-dead|title=Chuck Berry, a Founding Father of Rock 'n' Roll, Dies at 90|work=Billboard|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/5076088-155/chuck-berry-a-rock-n-roll|title=Chuck Berry, a rock 'n' roll originator, dies at age 90|last=Press|first=Associated|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=March 27, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the [[Mann Act]]—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/295/295.F2d.192.16752_1.html |title=295 F.2d 192 |publisher=ftp.resource.org |accessdate=June 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013023507/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/295/295.F2d.192.16752_1.html |archive-date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pegg|2003|pp=119–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including &quot;[[No Particular Place to Go]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Never Can Tell (song)|You Never Can Tell]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Nadine (song)|Nadine]]&quot;. But these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt; In 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of &quot;[[My Ding-a-Ling]]&quot; became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.

Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having &quot;laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chuck Berry |publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/chuck-berry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry is included in several of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's &quot;greatest of all time&quot; lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;immortals&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Immortals: The First Fifty |work=Rolling Stone |issue=946 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939208/5_chuck_berry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621080922/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939208/5_chuck_berry |archive-date=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]] includes three of Berry's: &quot;Johnny B.

He grew up in the north [[St. Louis]] neighborhood known as [[The Ville, St. Louis|the Ville]], an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987) was a contractor and deacon of a nearby [[Baptist]] church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980) was a certified public school principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dXw6gR2GgkC&amp;q=Martha+Bell+(Banks)+Henry+William+Berry&amp;pg=PA71 |title=African American Lives |page=71 |date=April 29, 2004 |isbn=9780199882861 |accessdate=March 21, 2017|last1=Jr |first1=Henry Louis Gates |last2=Higginbotham |first2=Evelyn Brooks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age.

On October 28, 1948, Berry married Themetta &quot;Toddy&quot; Suggs, who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3, 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Early|first=Gerald Lyn|title=Ain't but a Place: An Anthology of African American Writings About St. Louis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRLhcVs_pJUC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=February 6, 2014|year=1998|publisher=Missouri History Museum|isbn=9781883982287|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis, working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived. Afterwards he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology, founded by [[Annie Malone|Annie Turnbo Malone]].&lt;ref name=page179&gt;Pegg, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a &quot;small three room brick cottage with a bath&quot; on Whittier Street,&lt;ref&gt;Early, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; which is now listed as the [[Chuck Berry House]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outside.in/greater-ville-st-louis-mo/chuck-berrys-house|title=News About Chuck Berry's House in Greater Ville, St. Louis, MO|publisher=outside.in|accessdate=June 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185424/http://outside.in/greater-ville-st-louis-mo/chuck-berrys-house|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income.&lt;ref name=page179/&gt; He had been playing [[blues music|blues]] since his teens, and he borrowed both guitar riffs and [[guitar showmanship|showmanship]] techniques from the blues musician [[T-Bone Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohn|first=Lawrence|title=Nothing but the Blues: The Music and the Musicians|year=1993|author2=Aldin, Mary Katherine|author3=Bastin, Bruce|publisher=Abbeville Press|isbn=978-1-55859-271-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/nothingbutbluesm00cohn/page/174 174]|url=https://archive.org/details/nothingbutbluesm00cohn/page/174}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which laid the foundation for his guitar style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.com/about/bio.htm|title=The Official Site of Chuck Berry|publisher=chuckberry.com|accessdate=February 18, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109044235/http://www.chuckberry.com/about/bio.htm|archive-date=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1953 Berry was performing with [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]]'s trio, starting a long-time collaboration with the pianist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/printfullstory.aspx?storyid=35622|title=Chuck Berry Remembers Johnnie Johnson|last=Wittenauer|first=Cheryl|agency=Associated Press|publisher=firstcoastnews.com|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band played blues and ballads as well as [[country music|country]]. Berry wrote, &quot;Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black [[hillbilly]] at the Cosmo?' After they laughed at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chuck Berry&quot;/&gt;

Berry's showmanship, along with a mix of country tunes and R&amp;B tunes, sung in the style of [[Nat King Cole]] set to the music of [[Muddy Waters]] brought in a wider audience, particularly affluent white people.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.com/about/bio.htm|title=The Official Site of Chuck Berry|publisher=chuckberry.com|accessdate=June 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109044235/http://www.chuckberry.com/about/bio.htm|archive-date=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chuck Berry circa 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Berry in a 1958 publicity photo]]

In May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]], of [[Chess Records]]. Berry thought his blues music would interest Chess, but Chess was a larger fan of Berry's take on &quot;[[Ida Red]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=pc5&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |5|5 |Leonard Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On May 21, 1955, Berry recorded an adaptation of the song &quot;Ida Red&quot;, under the title &quot;[[Maybellene]]&quot;, with [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] on the piano, [[Jerome Green]] (from [[Bo Diddley]]'s band) on the maracas, Jasper Thomas on the drums and [[Willie Dixon]] on the bass. &quot;Maybellene&quot; sold over a million copies, reaching number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10, 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chuck Berry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die-rock-and-roll-ag.de/html/chuck_1955-56.html|title=Chuck 1955–56|publisher=Die-rock-and-roll-ag.de|accessdate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002113531/http://www.die-rock-and-roll-ag.de/html/chuck_1955-56.html|archive-date=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berry said, &quot;It came out at the right time when Afro-American music was spilling over into the mainstream pop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NBC Evening News, March 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June 1956, his song &quot;[[Roll Over Beethoven]]&quot; reached number 29 on the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top 100 chart, and Berry toured as one of the &quot;Top Acts of '56&quot;. He and [[Carl Perkins]] became friends. Perkins said that &quot;I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been affected by country music.

(1959), in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, &quot;[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis, Tennessee]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Little Queenie]]&quot;.

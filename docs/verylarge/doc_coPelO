The [[optic nerve]] is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the [[lateral geniculate body]], a visual relay station in the [[diencephalon]] (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the [[superior colliculus]], the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], and the [[nucleus of the optic tract]]. It passes through the other layers, creating the [[optic disc]] in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Shepherd, Gordon |year = 2004 |title = The Synaptic Organization of the Brain |url = https://archive.org/details/synapticorganiza00mdgo_475 |url-access = limited |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = New York |pages = [https://archive.org/details/synapticorganiza00mdgo_475/page/n233 217]–225 |isbn = 978-0-19-515956-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional structures, not directly associated with vision, are found as outgrowths of the retina in some vertebrate groups. In [[bird]]s, the [[pecten oculi|pecten]] is a vascular structure of complex shape that projects from the retina into the [[vitreous humour]]; it supplies oxygen and nutrients to the eye, and may also aid in vision. [[Reptile]]s have a similar, but much simpler, structure.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author = Romer, Alfred Sherwood |author2 = Parsons, Thomas S. |year = 1977 |title = The Vertebrate Body |publisher = Holt-Saunders International |location = Philadelphia, PA |page = 465 |isbn = 978-0-03-910284-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adult humans, the entire retina is approximately 72% of a sphere about 22&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. The entire retina contains about 7 million cones and 75 to 150 million rods. The optic disc, a part of the retina sometimes called &quot;the blind spot&quot; because it lacks photoreceptors, is located at the [[Optic disc|optic papilla]], where the optic-nerve fibres leave the eye. It appears as an oval white area of 3&amp;nbsp;mm². Temporal (in the direction of the temples) to this disc is the [[macula]], at whose centre is the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], a pit that is responsible for our sharp central vision but is actually less sensitive to light because of its lack of rods. Human and non-human [[primate]]s possess one fovea, as opposed to certain bird species, such as hawks, who are bifoviate, and dogs and cats, who possess no fovea but a central band known as the visual streak.{{citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=Citations are needed for some of these statements, esp. bifoviate hawks and the lack of fovea in cats and dogs}} Around the fovea extends the central retina for about 6&amp;nbsp;mm and then the peripheral retina. The farthest edge of the retina is defined by the [[ora serrata]]. The distance from one ora to the other (or macula), the most sensitive area along the horizontal [[meridian (eye)|meridian]] is about 32&amp;nbsp;mm.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=sentence is confusing; is all the area between the ora the macula, and are we talking length of curvature or that of a straight line?}}

In section, the retina is no more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm thick. It has three layers of [[nerve]] cells and two of [[synapse]]s, including the unique [[ribbon synapse]]. The optic nerve carries the [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]] [[axon]]s to the brain, and the blood vessels that supply the retina. The ganglion cells lie innermost in the eye while the photoreceptive cells lie beyond. Because of this counter-intuitive arrangement, light must first pass through and around the ganglion cells and through the thickness of the retina, (including its capillary vessels, not shown) before reaching the rods and cones. Light is absorbed by the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] or the [[choroid]] (both of which are opaque).

The [[white blood cell]]s in the [[capillaries]] in front of the photoreceptors can be perceived as tiny bright moving dots when looking into blue light. This is known as the [[blue field entoptic phenomenon]] (or Scheerer's phenomenon).

Between the [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]] layer and the rods and cones there are two layers of [[neuropil]]s where synaptic contacts are made. The neuropil layers are the [[outer plexiform layer]] and the [[inner plexiform layer]]. In the outer neuropil layer, the rods and cones connect to the vertically running [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar cells]], and the horizontally oriented [[Retina horizontal cell|horizontal cells]] connect to ganglion cells.

The central retina predominantly contains cones, while the peripheral retina predominantly contains rods. In total, there are about seven million cones and a hundred million rods. At the centre of the macula is the foveal pit where the cones are narrow and long, and, arranged in a hexagonal [[retinal mosaic|mosaic]], the most dense, in contradistinction to the much fatter cones located more peripherally in the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guyton and Hall Physiology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the foveal pit the other retinal layers are displaced, before building up along the foveal slope until the rim of the fovea, or [[parafovea]], is reached, which is the thickest portion of the retina. The macula has a yellow pigmentation, from screening pigments, and is known as the macula lutea. The area directly surrounding the fovea has the highest density of rods converging on single bipolar cells. Since its cones have a much lesser convergence of signals, the fovea allows for the sharpest vision the eye can attain.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

Though the rod and cones are a [[retinal mosaic|mosaic]] of sorts, transmission from receptors, to bipolars, to [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] is not direct. Since there are about 150 million receptors and only 1 million optic nerve fibres, there must be convergence and thus mixing of signals. Moreover, the horizontal action of the [[Retina horizontal cell|horizontal]] and [[Retina amacrine cell|amacrine cells]] can allow one area of the retina to control another (e.g. one stimulus inhibiting another). This inhibition is key to lessening the sum of messages sent to the higher regions of the brain. In some lower vertebrates (e.g. the [[pigeon]]), there is a &quot;centrifugal&quot; control of messages – that is, one layer can control another, or higher regions of the brain can drive the retinal nerve cells, but in primates this does not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

==== Layers imagable with optical coherence tomography ====

=== Development ===
Retinal development begins with the establishment of the eye fields mediated by the [[Sonic hedgehog|SHH]] and [[SIX3]] proteins, with subsequent development of the optic vesicles regulated by the [[PAX6]] and [[LHX2]] proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heavner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Heavner |first = W |author2 = Pevny, L |title = Eye development and retinogenesis. |journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |date = 1 December 2012 |volume = 4 |issue = 12 |pmid = 23071378 |doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a008391 |pages = a008391 |pmc = 3504437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Pax6 in eye development was elegantly demonstrated by Walter Gehring and colleagues, who showed that ectopic expression of Pax6 can lead to eye formation on [[Drosophila]] antennae, wings, and legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Halder |first = G |author2 = Callaerts, P |author3 = Gehring, WJ |title = Induction of ectopic eyes by targeted expression of the eyeless gene in Drosophila |journal = Science |date = 24 March 1995 |volume = 267 |issue = 5205 |pages = 1788–1792 |pmid = 7892602 |doi = 10.1126/science.7892602 |bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1788H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The optic vesicle gives rise to three structures: the neural retina, the retinal pigmented epithelium, and the optic stalk. The neural retina contains the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that give rise to the seven cell types of the retina. Differentiation begins with the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s and concludes with production of the Muller glia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cepko|first=Connie|date=September 2014|title=Intrinsically different retinal progenitor cells produce specific types of progeny|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=15|issue=9|pages=615–627|doi=10.1038/nrn3767|pmid=25096185|s2cid=15038502|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each cell type differentiates from the RPCs in a sequential order, there is considerable overlap in the timing of when individual cell types differentiate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heavner&quot; /&gt; The cues that determine a RPC daughter cell fate are coded by multiple transcription factor families including the [[Basic helix-loop-helix|bHLH]] and [[Homeobox|homeodomain]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Hatakeyama |first = J |author2 = Kageyama, R |title = Retinal cell fate determination and bHLH factors |journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology |date = February 2004 |volume = 15 |issue = 1 |pages = 83–89 |pmid = 15036211 |doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2003.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lo Giudice|first1=Quentin|last2=Leleu|first2=Marion|last3=La Manno|first3=Gioele|last4=Fabre|first4=Pierre J.|date=1 September 2019|title=Single-cell transcriptional logic of cell-fate specification and axon guidance in early-born retinal neurons|journal=Development|volume=146|issue=17|pages=dev178103|doi=10.1242/dev.178103|pmid=31399471|issn=0950-1991|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to guiding cell fate determination, cues exist in the retina to determine the dorsal-ventral (D-V) and nasal-temporal (N-T) axes. The D-V axis is established by a ventral to dorsal gradient of [[VAX1|VAX2]], whereas the N-T axis is coordinated by expression of the forkhead transcription factors [[FOXD1]] and [[FOXG1]]. Additional gradients are formed within the retina.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This spatial distribution may aid in proper targeting of RGC axons that function to establish the retinotopic map.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heavner&quot; /&gt;

====Circulatory mechanisms====

At first glance, one may think that the vertebrate retina is &quot;wired wrongly&quot; or &quot;badly designed&quot;; but in fact, the retina could not function if it were not inverted. The photoreceptor layer must be embedded in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which performs at least seven vital functions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Olaf|title=The retinal pigment epithelium|url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/the-retinal-pigment-epithelium|website=Webvision|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most obvious being to supply oxygen and other necessary nutrients needed for the photoreceptors to function. These nutrients include glucose, fatty acids, and retinal. The mammalian photoreceptor amplification process uses large quantities energy for vision in photopic conditions (requiring less under scotopic conditions) and, thus, requires the large supply nutrients supplied by the blood vessels in the choroid, which lies beyond the RPE. The choroid supplies about 75% of these nutrients to the retina and the retinal vasculature only 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolb&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolb|first1=Helga|title=Simple Anatomy of the Retina|url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-i-foundations/simple-anatomy-of-the-retina/|website=Webvision|year=1995|pmid=21413391|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When light strikes 11-cis-retinal (in the disks in the rods and cones), 11-cis-retinal changes to all-trans-retinal which then triggers changes in the opsins. Now, the outer segments do not regenerate the retinal back into the cis- form once it has been changed by light. Instead the retinal is pumped out to the surrounding RPE where it is regenerated and transported back into the outer segments of the photoreceptors. This recycling function of the RPE protects the photoreceptors against photo-oxidative damage&lt;ref&gt;Photobiology of the retina {{cite web |url=http://www.photobiology.info/Rozanowska.html |title=Light-Induced Damage to the Retina|accessdate=27 July 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809035104/http://www.photobiology.info/Rozanowska.html |archivedate=9 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diagrammatic representation of disc shedding and phagosome retrieval into the pigment epithelial cell {{cite web |url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/photphag.jpeg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 July 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011139/http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/photphag.jpeg |archivedate=21 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows the photoreceptor cells to have decades-long useful lives.

===== In birds =====
The bird retina is devoid of blood vessels, perhaps to give unobscured passage of light for forming images, thus giving better resolution. It is, therefore, a considered view that the bird retina depends for nutrition and oxygen supply on a specialized organ, called the &quot;pecten&quot; or [[pecten oculi]], located on the blind spot or optic disk. This organ is extremely rich in blood vessels and is thought to supply nutrition and oxygen to the bird retina by diffusion through the vitreous body. The pecten is highly rich in alkaline phosphatase activity and polarized cells in its bridge portion – both befitting its secretory role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Bawa S.R. |author2 = YashRoy R.C. |year = 1972 |title = Effect of dark and light adaptation on the retina and pecten of chicken |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18108932 |journal = Experimental Eye Research |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 92–97 |doi = 10.1016/0014-4835(72)90129-7 |pmid = 5060117 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141009111444/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/18108932_Effect_of_dark_and_light_adaptation_on_the_retina_and_pecten_of_chicken?ev=prf_pub |archivedate = 9 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pecten cells are packed with dark melanin granules, which have been theorized to keep this organ warm with the absorption of stray light falling on the pecten. This is considered to enhance metabolic rate of the pecten, thereby exporting more nutritive molecules to meet the stringent energy requirements of the retina during long periods of exposure to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Bawa |first1 = S.R. |last2 = YashRoy |first2 = R.C. |year = 1974 |title = Structure and function of vulture pecten |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231569868 |journal = Cells Tissues Organs |volume = 89 |issue = 3 |pages = 473–480 |doi = 10.1159/000144308 |pmid = 4428954 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150714070339/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/231569868_Structure_and_function_of_vulture_pecten?ev=prf_pub |archivedate = 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
{{See also|Adaptation (eye)|Visual acuity}}

The retina translates an optical image into neural impulses starting with the patterned excitation of the colour-sensitive pigments of its rods and cones, the retina's [[photoreceptor cell]]s. The excitation is processed by the neural system and various parts of the brain working in parallel to form a representation of the external environment in the brain.

The cones respond to bright light and mediate high-resolution colour vision during daylight illumination (also called [[photopic vision]]). The rod responses are saturated at daylight levels and don't contribute to pattern vision. However, rods do respond to dim light and mediate lower-resolution, monochromatic vision under very low levels of illumination (called [[scotopic vision]]). The illumination in most office settings falls between these two levels and is called [[mesopic vision]]. At mesopic light levels, both the rods and cones are actively contributing pattern information. What contribution the rod information makes to pattern vision under these circumstances is unclear.

The response of cones to various wavelengths of light is called their spectral sensitivity. In normal human vision, the spectral sensitivity of a cone falls into one of three subtypes, often called blue, green, and red, but more accurately known as short, medium, and long wavelength-sensitive cone subtypes. It is a lack of one or more of the cone subtypes that causes individuals to have deficiencies in colour vision or various kinds of [[colour blindness]]. These individuals are not blind to objects of a particular colour, but are unable to distinguish between colours that can be distinguished by people with normal vision. Humans have this [[trichromatic vision]], while most other mammals lack cones with red sensitive pigment and therefore have poorer dichromatic colour vision. However, some animals have four spectral subtypes, e.g. the trout adds an ultraviolet subgroup to short, medium, and long subtypes that are similar to humans. Some fish are sensitive to the polarization of light as well.

In the photoreceptors, exposure to light hyperpolarizes the membrane in a series of graded shifts. The outer cell segment contains a [[photopigment]]. Inside the cell the normal levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP) keep the Na+ channel open, and thus in the resting state the cell is depolarised. The [[photon]] causes the [[retinal]] bound to the receptor protein to [[Isomerism|isomerise]] to [[retinal|trans-retinal]]. This causes the receptor to activate multiple [[G-protein]]s. This in turn causes the Ga-subunit of the protein to activate a phosphodiesterase (PDE6), which degrades cGMP, resulting in the closing of Na+ [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s (CNGs). Thus the cell is hyperpolarised. The amount of neurotransmitter released is reduced in bright light and increases as light levels fall. The actual photopigment is bleached away in bright light and only replaced as a chemical process, so in a transition from bright light to darkness the eye can take up to thirty minutes to reach full sensitivity.

When thus excited by light, the photoceptor sends a proportional response [[Synapse|synaptically]] to [[bipolar cell]]s which in turn signal the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s. The photoreceptors are also cross-linked by [[horizontal cell]]s and [[amacrine cell]]s, which modify the synaptic signal before it reaches the ganglion cells, the neural signals being intermixed and combined. Of the retina's nerve cells, only the retinal ganglion cells and few amacrine cells create [[action potential]]s.

In the retinal ganglion cells there are two types of response, depending on the [[receptive field]] of the cell. The receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells comprise a central, approximately circular area, where light has one effect on the firing of the cell, and an annular surround, where light has the opposite effect. In ON cells, an increment in light intensity in the centre of the receptive field causes the firing rate to increase. In OFF cells, it makes it decrease. In a linear model, this response profile is well described by a [[difference of Gaussians]] and is the basis for [[edge detection]] algorithms. Beyond this simple difference, ganglion cells are also differentiated by chromatic sensitivity and the type of spatial summation. Cells showing linear spatial summation are termed X cells (also called parvocellular, P, or midget ganglion cells), and those showing non-linear summation are Y cells (also called magnocellular, M, or parasol retinal ganglion cells), although the correspondence between X and Y cells (in the cat retina) and P and M cells (in the primate retina) is not as simple as it once seemed.

In the transfer of visual signals to the brain, the [[visual pathway]], the retina is vertically divided in two, a temporal (nearer to the temple) half and a nasal (nearer to the nose) half. The axons from the nasal half cross the brain at the [[optic chiasma]] to join with axons from the temporal half of the other eye before passing into the [[lateral geniculate body]].

Although there are more than 130 million retinal receptors, there are only approximately 1.2 million fibres (axons) in the optic nerve. So, a large amount of pre-processing is performed within the retina. The [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] produces the most accurate information. Despite occupying about 0.01% of the visual field (less than 2° of [[visual angle]]), about 10% of axons in the optic nerve are devoted to the fovea. The resolution limit of the fovea has been determined to be around 10,000 points. The information capacity is estimated at 500,000 bits per second (for more information on bits, see [[information theory]]) without colour or around 600,000 bits per second including colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of visual display technology|date=2016|publisher=Springer|others=Chen, Janglin., Cranton, Wayne., Fihn, Mark.|isbn=9783319143460|edition=2nd|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=962009228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial encoding ===
{{Further|Receptive field|label1=Receptive field, for figures and more information on centre–surround structures}}
[[File:Receptive field.png|thumb|upright=1.36|right|On-centres and off-centres of the retina]]

When the retina sends neural impulses representing an image to the brain, it spatially encodes (compresses) those impulses to fit the limited capacity of the optic nerve. Compression is necessary because there are 100 times more [[photoreceptor cell]]s than [[ganglion cell]]s. This is done by &quot;[[decorrelation]]&quot;, which is carried out by the &quot;centre–surround structures&quot;, which are implemented by the bipolar and ganglion cells.

There are two types of centre–surround structures in the retina – on-centres and off-centres. On-centres have a positively weighted centre and a negatively weighted surround. Off-centres are just the opposite. Positive weighting is more commonly known as [[Chemical synapse#Receptor binding|excitatory]], and negative weighting as [[Chemical synapse#Receptor binding|inhibitory]].

These centre–surround structures are not physical apparent, in the sense that one cannot see them by staining samples of tissue and examining the retina's anatomy. The centre–surround structures are logical (i.e., mathematically abstract) in the sense that they depend on the connection strengths between bipolar and ganglion cells. It is believed that the connection strength between cells is caused by the number and types of [[ion channel]]s embedded in the [[synapse]]s between the bipolar and ganglion cells.

The centre–surround structures are mathematically equivalent to the [[edge detection]] algorithms used by computer programmers to extract or enhance the edges in a digital photograph. Thus, the retina performs operations on the image-representing impulses to enhance the edges of objects within its visual field. For example, in a picture of a dog, a cat and a car, it is the edges of these objects that contain the most information. In order for higher functions in the brain (or in a computer for that matter) to extract and classify objects such as a dog and a cat, the retina is the first step to separating out the various objects within the scene.

As an example, the following [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is at the heart of a computer [[algorithm]] that implements edge detection. This matrix is the computer equivalent to the centre–surround structure. In this example, each box (element) within this matrix would be connected to one photoreceptor. The photoreceptor in the centre is the current receptor being processed. The centre photoreceptor is multiplied by the +1 weight factor. The surrounding photoreceptors are the &quot;nearest neighbors&quot; to the centre and are multiplied by the −1/8 value. The sum of all nine of these elements is finally calculated. This summation is repeated for every photoreceptor in the image by shifting left to the end of a row and then down to the next line.

The total sum of this matrix is zero, if all the inputs from the nine photoreceptors are of the same value. The zero result indicates the image was uniform (non-changing) within this small patch. Negative or positive sums mean the image was varying (changing) within this small patch of nine photoreceptors.

The above matrix is only an approximation to what really happens inside the retina. The differences are:
* The above example is called &quot;balanced&quot;. The term balanced means that the sum of the negative weights is equal to the sum of the positive weights so that they cancel out perfectly. Retinal ganglion cells are almost never perfectly balanced.
* The table is square while the centre–surround structures in the retina are circular.
* Neurons operate on [[spike train]]s traveling down nerve cell [[axons]]. Computers operate on a single [[floating point]] number that is essentially constant from each input [[pixel]]. (The computer pixel is basically the equivalent of a biological photoreceptor.)
* The retina performs all these calculations in parallel while the computer operates on each pixel one at a time. The retina performs no repeated summations and shifting as would a computer.
* Finally, the [[horizontal cell|horizontal]] and [[amacrine cell]]s play a significant role in this process, but that is not represented here.

Here is an example of an input image and how edge detection would modify it.

[[File:Edge-detection-2.jpg|frameless|upright=2.5|alt=input image]]

Once the image is spatially encoded by the centre–surround structures, the signal is sent out along the optic nerve (via the axons of the ganglion cells) through the [[optic chiasm]] to the LGN ([[lateral geniculate nucleus]]). The exact function of the LGN is unknown at this time. The output of the LGN is then sent to the back of the brain. Specifically, the output of the LGN &quot;radiates&quot; out to the V1 [[primary visual cortex]].

Simplified signal flow: Photoreceptors → Bipolar → Ganglion → Chiasm → LGN → V1 cortex

== Clinical significance{{anchor|Diseases_and_disorders}} ==

There are many inherited and acquired diseases or disorders that may affect the retina. Some of them include:
* [[Retinitis pigmentosa]] is a group of genetic diseases that affect the retina and cause the loss of night vision and peripheral vision.
* [[Macular degeneration]] describes a group of diseases characterized by loss of central vision because of death or impairment of the cells in the [[macula]].
* [[Cone-rod dystrophy]] (CORD) describes a number of diseases where vision loss is caused by deterioration of the [[Cone cell|cones]] and/or [[Rod cell|rods]] in the retina.
* In [[retinal separation]], the retina detaches from the back of the eyeball. [[Ignipuncture]] is an outdated treatment method. The term [[retinal detachment]] is used to describe a separation of the neurosensory retina from the [[retinal pigment epithelium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Retina&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title = Retina |date = 2006 |publisher = Elsevier/Mosby |isbn = 978-0-323-02598-0 |edition = 4th |location = Philadelphia |pages = 2013–2015 |oclc = 62034580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several modern treatment methods for fixing a retinal detachment: [[pneumatic retinopexy]], [[scleral buckle]], [[cryotherapy]], [[laser photocoagulation]] and pars plana [[vitrectomy]].
* Both [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes mellitus]] can cause damage to the tiny blood vessels that supply the retina, leading to [[hypertensive retinopathy]] and [[diabetic retinopathy]].
* [[Retinoblastoma]] is a [[cancer]] of the retina.
* Retinal diseases in [[dog]]s include [[retinal dysplasia]], [[progressive retinal atrophy]], and [[sudden acquired retinal degeneration]].
* ''Lipemia retinalis'' is a white appearance of the retina, and can occur by lipid deposition in [[lipoprotein lipase deficiency]].
* ''Retinal Detachment''. The neural retina occasionally detaches from the pigment epithelium. In some instances, the cause of such detachment is injury to the eyeball that allows fluid or blood to collect between the neural retina and the pigment epithelium. Detachment is occasionally caused by contracture of fine collagenous fibrils in the vitreous humor, which pull areas of the retina toward the interior of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guyton and Hall Physiology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Night Blindness '': Night blindness occurs in any person with severe vitamin A deficiency. The reason for this is that without vitamin A, the amounts of retinal and rhodopsin that can be formed are severely depressed. This condition is called night blindness because the amount of light available at night is too little to permit adequate vision in vitamin A–deficient persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guyton and Hall Physiology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

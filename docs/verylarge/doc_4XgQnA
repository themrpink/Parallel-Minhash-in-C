In February 1999, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] secured the rights for [[UEFA Champions League]] football matches for four years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/feb/25/broadcasting3|title=Timeline: a history of TV football rights|date=25 February 2003|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would partly be broadcast through ONdigital and two new sports channels on the platform, Champions ON 28 and Champions ON 99 (later renamed ONsport 1 and ONsport 2 when it secured the rights to [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tennis games), the latter of which timeshared with [[Carlton Cinema (TV channel)|Carlton Cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transdiffusion.org/2001/01/01/ontrack|title=ONtrack again – Digital – Transdiffusion|website=www.transdiffusion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1999, channels including [[MTV]] and [[British Eurosport]] launched on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://625.uk.com/digital/|title=Digital TV|first=Andrew|last=Wiseman|website=625.uk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusive [[Carlton Kids]] and [[Carlton World]] channels closed in 2000 to make way for two [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/discovery-channels-boost-ondigital-1134114.html|title=Discovery channels boost ONdigital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ONdigital reported in April 1999 that it had 110,000 subscribers. Sky Digital, however, had over 350,000 by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; By March 2000, there were 673,000 ONdigital customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/analysis-brand-spend-analysis-ondigital-will-continue-spend-heavily-itv-vies-sky-viewers/31435|title=Analysis: Brand spend analysis – ONdigital will continue to spend heavily on ITV as it vies with Sky for viewers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interactive digital service was launched in mid-1999, called ONgames. On 7 March 2000, [[ONmail]] was launched which provided an interactive [[e-mail]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
    | url = http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=53031
    | title = Ondigital on course for 1 million customers

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deal with multiplex operator [[S4C Digital Networks|SDN]] led to the launch of [[pay-per-view]] service ONrequest on 1 May 2000. In June 2000, ONoffer was launched. On 18 September 2000, the [[internet]] TV service ONnet was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Service Engineers Forum
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2000, ONdigital agreed to a major £315 million three-year deal with the [[English Football League|Football League]] to broadcast 88 live Nationwide League and [[EFL Cup|Worthington Cup]] matches from the 2001–02 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/163-315m-nets-ondigital-and-itv-league-rights-1-462058|title=£315m nets ONdigital and ITV League rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems===
ONdigital's growth slowed throughout 2000, and by the start of 2001 the number of subscribers stopped increasing; meanwhile, its competitor Sky Digital was still growing. The ONdigital management team responded with a series of free set top box promotions, initially at retailers such as [[Currys]] and [[Dixons (online)|Dixons]], when ONdigital receiving equipment was purchased at the same time as a television set or similarly priced piece of equipment. These offers eventually became permanent, with the set-top box loaned to the customer at no charge for as long as they continued to subscribe to ONdigital. This offer was matched by Sky. ONdigital's [[churn rate]], a measure of the number of subscribers leaving the service, reached 28% during 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Monkey Business | series = [[The Money Programme]] | network = BBC Two | airdate = 2002-06-12 | minutes = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional problems for ONdigital were the choice of [[64QAM]] broadcast mode, which when coupled with far weaker than expected broadcast power, meant that the signal was weak in many areas; a complex pricing structure with many options; a poor-quality subscriber management system (adapted from [[Canal+]]); a paper magazine TV guide whereas BSkyB had an [[Electronic program guide|electronic programme guide]] (EPG); insufficient technical customer services; and much [[Pirate decryption|signal piracy]]. While there was a limited return path provided via an in-built 2400 baud [[modem]], there was no requirement, as there was with BSkyB, to connect the set-top box's modem to a phone line.

==== Loaned equipment ====
Later problems occurred when ONdigital began to sell prepaid set-top boxes (under the name ONprepaid) from November 1999. This bundle sold in high street stores and supermarkets at a price that included – in theory – the set-top box on loan and the first year's subscription package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/ondigital-prepaid-digital-boxes-go-sales-uk-wide/43434|title=ONdigital prepaid digital boxes go sales UK-wide}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prepaid boxes amounted to 50% of sales in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/12/14|title=ONdigital reports 34% rise in sales|first=Terry|last=Macalister|date=12 January 2000|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of these packages were also sold at well below retail price on auction sites such as the then-popular [[Tradus|QXL]]. As the call to activate the viewing card did not require any bank details, many ONdigital boxes which were technically on loan were at unverifiable addresses. This was later changed so a customer could not walk away with a box without ONdigital verifying their address. Many customers did not activate the viewing card at all, although where the viewer's address was known, ONdigital would write informing them that they must activate before a certain deadline.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Piracy ====
The ONdigital [[pay-per-view]] channels were encrypted using a system – [[Nagra France|SECA]] [[MediaGuard]] – which had subsequently been cracked. ONdigital did not update this system, therefore it was possible to produce and sell counterfeit subscription cards which would give access to all the channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 100,000 pirate cards were in circulation by 2002, and these played a role in the demise of the broadcaster that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1393115/Background-to-failure-of-the-digital-dream.html|title=Background to failure of the digital dream|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebranding===
[[File:Monkey vegas.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from one of ITV Digital's adverts, featuring [[Johnny Vegas]] and the &quot;[[Monkey (character)|ITV Digital Monkey]]&quot;]]
In April 2001 it was said that ONdigital would be 'relaunched' to bring it closer to the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and to better compete with Sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1292510.stm|title=Ondigital 'faces relaunch'|date=23 April 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2001 Carlton and Granada rebranded ONdigital as '''ITV Digital'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
    | url       = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1433671.stm
    | title     = Ondigital relaunches as ITV Digital
    | date      = 11 July 2001
    | work = BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other services were also rebranded, such as ONnet to ITV Active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1433671.stm|title=Ondigital relaunches as ITV Digital|date=11 July 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A re-branding campaign was launched, with customers being sent ITV Digital stickers to place over the ONdigital logos on their remote controls and set top boxes. The software running on the receivers was not changed, however, and continued to display 'ON' on nearly every screen.

The rebrand was not without controversy, as [[STV Group plc|SMG plc]] (owner of [[Scottish Television]] and [[Grampian Television]]), [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[Channel Television]] all pointed out that the ITV brand did not belong solely to Carlton and Granada. SMG and UTV initially refused to carry the advertising campaign for ITV Digital and did not allow the ITV Sport Channel space on their multiplex, thus it was not available at launch in most of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The case was resolved in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Later in 2001, [[ITV Sport Channel]] was announced. This would be a premium sport channel, and would broadcast English football games as per the company's deal with the Football League in 2000, as well as ATP tennis games and Champions League games previously covered by ONsport 1 and ONsport 2. The channel launched on 11 August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/ondigital-plans-premium-sports-channel/12934|title=ONdigital plans premium sports channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
The service reached 1 million subscribers by January 2001, whereas Sky Digital had 5.7 million. Granada reported £69 million in losses in the first six months of 2001, leading some investors to urge it to close or sell ONdigital/ITV Digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1409758.stm|title=Granada urged to ditch ONdigital|date=27 June 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV Digital was unable to make a deal to put the ITV Sport Channel on Sky, which could have given the channel access to millions of Sky customers and generated income; the channel was only licensed to cable company [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]]. Subscriptions for ONnet/ITV Active, its internet service, peaked at around 100,000 customers.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Terrestrial Television in Europe edited by Allan Brown, Robert G. Picard&lt;/ref&gt; ITV Digital had a 12% share of digital subscribers as of December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1702272.stm|title=A cold climate for digital TV|date=11 December 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV Digital and Granada cut jobs that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1711919.stm|title=ITV Digital to cut 550 jobs|date=14 December 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1815745.stm|title=Viewers desert ITV Digital|date=12 February 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, the company was thought to be losing up to £1 million per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citywire.co.uk/money/itv-digital-administrators-offered-extra-time/a236883|title=ITV Digital administrators offered extra time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2002, Carlton and Granada said that ITV Digital needed an urgent &quot;fundamental restructuring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1843673.stm|title=ITV Digital in crisis, owners say|date=27 February 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest cost the company faced was its three-year deal with the Football League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1853678.stm|title=ITV Digital's flickering future|date=5 March 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1855280.stm|title=ITV Digital football contract 'binding'|date=5 March 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was already deemed too expensive by critics when agreed, as it was inferior to the top-flight [[Premier League|Premiership]] coverage from [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/3020803/ITVs-expensive-miscalculation.html|title=ITV's expensive miscalculation|first=Paul|last=Fox|date=26 March 2002|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 21 March 2002 that ITV Digital had proposed paying only £50 million for its remaining two years in the Football League deal, a reduction of £129m. Chiefs from the League said that any reduction in the payment could threaten the existence of many football clubs, which had budgeted for large incomes from the television contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1884853.stm|title=Football chiefs reject ITV deal|date=21 March 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
On 27 March 2002, ITV Digital was placed in [[administration (law)|administration]] as it was unable to pay the full amount due to the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1896732.stm|title=ITV Digital goes broke|date=27 March 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as chances of its survival remained bleak, the Football League sued Carlton and Granada, claiming that the firms had breached their contract in failing to deliver the guaranteed income. However, on 1 August the league lost the case, with the judge ruling that it had &quot;failed to extract sufficient written guarantees&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2165700.stm|title=League loses football cash battle|date=1 August 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league then filed a negligence claim against its own lawyers for failing to press for a written guarantee at the time of the deal with ITV Digital. From this, in June 2006, it was awarded a paltry £4 in damages of the £150m it was seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse put in doubt the government's ambition to switch off analogue terrestrial TV signals by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/28/broadcasting.itvdigital1|title=ITV Digital staggers towards collapse|first1=John|last1=Cassy|first2=Matt|last2=Wells|date=28 March 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite several interested parties, the administrators were unable to find a buyer for the company and effectively put it into [[liquidation]] on 26 April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2760880/ITV-Digital-faces-closure-within-days.html|title=ITV Digital faces closure 'within days'|first=George Trefgarne, Financial|last=Correspondent|date=25 April 2002|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most subscription channels stopped broadcasting on ITV Digital on 1 May 2002 at 7 am, with only free-to-air services continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/01/itv_digital_rip/|title=ITV Digital RIP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1961209.stm|title=Race to find digital broadcaster|date=1 May 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ITV chief executive [[Stuart Prebble]] quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1963455.stm|title=Top man at ITV quits|date=2 May 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 1,500 jobs were lost by ITV Digital's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/media-leisure/bskyb-needs-150-000-itv-customers-to-recoup-163-70m-1-950236 |title=BSkyB needs 150,000 ITV customers to recoup £70m}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITV Digital was eventually placed into liquidation on 18 October, with debts of £1.25 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=2003-01-21|title=ITV bosses box clever over set-top giveaway|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/21/broadcasting.itvdigital|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-29|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-collapse===
By 30 April 2002, the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) had revoked ITV Digital's broadcasting licence and started looking for a buyer. A consortium made up of the [[BBC]] and [[Crown Castle]] submitted an application on 13 June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/06_june/13/digital_terrestrial.shtml|title=BBC – Press Office – Digital Terrestrial|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; later joined by BSkyB, and were awarded the licence on 4 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1399251/BBC-wins-ex-ITV-digital-licences.html|title=BBC wins ex-ITV digital licences|date=3 July 2002|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; They launched the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service on 30 October 2002, offering 30 free-to-air TV channels and 20 free-to-air radio channels including several interactive channels such as [[BBC Red Button]] and [[Teletext]], but no subscription or premium services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2373143.stm|title=Freeview's 'fresh start' for digital TV|date=30 October 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those followed on 31 March 2004 when [[Top Up TV]] began broadcasting 11 [[pay TV]] channels in [[timeshare]]d broadcast slots.

From 10 December 2002, ITV Digital's liquidators started to ask customers to return their set top boxes or pay a £39.99 fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2561331.stm|title=Viewers told to return set-top boxes|date=10 December 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had this been successful, it could have threatened to undermine the fledgling Freeview service, since at the time most digital terrestrial receivers in households were ONdigital and ITV Digital legacy hardware. In January 2003, Carlton and Granada stepped in and paid £2.8m to the liquidators to allow the boxes to stay with their customers, because at the time the ITV companies received a discount on their broadcasting licence payments based on the number of homes they had converted to digital television. It was also likely done to avoid further negativity towards the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2675071.stm|title=ITV Digital viewers 'can keep' boxes|date=19 September 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time under administration, Carlton and Granada were in talks regarding a merger, which was eventually cleared in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2865417/ITV-cleared-for-a-united-kingdom.html|title=ITV cleared for a united kingdom|first=David|last=Litterick|date=7 October 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on football clubs====
[[File:Valley Parade Mainstand 2016.jpg|thumb|ITV Digital's collapse contributed to Bradford City F.C. being put into administration]]
ITV Digital's collapse had a large effect on many football clubs. [[Bradford City F.C.]] was one of the affected, and its debt forced it into administration in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/bradford-ready-for-greatest-comeback-in-clubs-history-183252.html|title=Bradford ready for greatest comeback in club's history}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3027857/Bradford-City-put-into-administration.html|title=Bradford City put into administration|date=16 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnsley F.C.]] also entered administration in October 2002, despite the club making a profit for the twelve years prior to the collapse of ITV Digital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/03/newsstory.sport10|title=Barnsley go into administration|last=Staff and agencies|date=3 October 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BarnsleyRecord&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/itv-digital-collapse-almost-destroyed-us---1026759|title=ITV Digital collapse almost destroyed us – now I fear SPL sides could suffer same fate, warns ex-Barnsley chairman|website=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=30 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnsley had budgeted on the basis that the money from the ITV Digital deal would be received, leaving a £2.5 million shortfall in their accounts when the broadcaster collapsed.&lt;ref name=BarnsleyRecord/&gt;

Clubs were forced to slash staff, and some players were forced to be sold as they were unable to pay them. Some clubs increased ticket prices for fans to offset the losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsroundanditswhite.co.uk/articles/the-effect-of-the-itv-digital-collapse-on-lower-league-football|title=The Effect of the ITV Digital Collapse on Lower League Football|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights to show [[Football League]] matches were resold to [[Sky Sports]] for £95 million for the next four years compared to £315 million over three years from ITV Digital, leading to a reduction from £2 million per season to £700,000 in broadcasting revenue for First Division clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2097852.stm |title=Football League agrees £95m TV deal |date=5 July 2002 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Earthquake&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twohundredpercent.net/earthquake-the-collapse-of-itv-digital/|title=Earthquake: The Collapse of ITV Digital|website=twohundredpercent.net|accessdate=30 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, fourteen [[Football League]] clubs were placed in administration within four years of the collapse of ITV Digital, compared to four in the four years before.&lt;ref name=Earthquake/&gt;

====News Corporation hacking allegations====
On 31 March 2002, French cable company [[Canal+]] accused [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] in the United States of extracting the UserROM code from its [[MediaGuard]] encryption cards and leaking it onto the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Rupertmurdoch.jpg|thumb|upright|Rupert Murdoch possibly used hacking to indirectly weaken ITV Digital]]
On 26 March 2012, an investigation from BBC's ''[[Panorama]]'' found evidence that one of News Corporation's subsidiaries sabotaged ITV Digital. It found that NDS hacked ONdigital/ITV Digital smartcard data and leaked them through a pirate website under Murdoch's control – actions which enabled pirated cards to flood the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a373442/news-corps-nds-accused-of-itv-digital-hack/|title=NDS accused of ITV Digital card hack|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17494723|title=Murdoch firm accused of hacking|date=27 March 2012|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations arose from emails obtained by the BBC, and an interview with Lee Gibling, the operator of a hacking website, who claimed he was paid up to £60,000 per year by [[Ray Adams]], NDS's head of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Lawyers for News Corporation claimed that these accusations of illegal activities against a rival business are &quot;false and libellous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/26/news-corp-ondigital-paytv-panorama|title=Questions for News Corp over rival's collapse|first=David|last=Leigh|date=26 March 2012|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 the [[Metropolitan Police]] decided to look into these allegations following a request by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/07/news-corp-subsidiary-nds-claim|title=Met looks into claims ex-News Corp subsidiary aided attack on pay-TV rival|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=7 June 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
ITV Digital ran an advertising campaign involving the comedian [[Johnny Vegas]] as Al and a knitted monkey simply called [[Monkey (character)|Monkey]], voiced by [[Ben Miller]]. A knitted replica of Monkey could be obtained by signing up to ITV Digital. Because the monkey could not be obtained without signing up to the service, a market for second-hand monkeys developed. At one time, original ITV Digital Monkeys were fetching several hundred pounds on [[eBay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,11034508,00.htm ITV Monkey funds TV shopping start-up] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153946/http://networks.silicon.com/webwatch/0,39024667,11034508,00.htm |date=9 October 2008 }} silicon.com, 11 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and knitting patterns delivered by email were sold for several pounds. The campaign was created by the advertising agency [[Mother (advertising agency)|Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ITV Monkey in custody battle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/may/02/broadcasting.itvdigital |work=guardian.co.uk |first=John |last=Cassy |date=2002-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, following ITV Digital's collapse, Vegas claimed that he was owed money for the advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2203705.stm|title=Vegas 'owed money for Monkey ads'|date=19 August 2002|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2007, Monkey and Al reappeared in an advert for [[PG Tips]] tea, which at first included a reference to ITV Digital's downfall.

==Set top boxes==
[[File:ONdigitalcard.jpg|thumb|ONdigital viewing card]]
This is a list of ex-ITV and ONdigital set-top boxes. All boxes used similar software, with the design of the user interface common to all models. [[Top Up TV]] provided a small update in 2004 which upgraded minor technicalities with encryption services.

*[[Nokia]] Mediamaster 9850T
*[[Pace Micro Technology]] DTR-730, DTR-735
*[[Philips]] DTX 6370, DTX 6371, DTX 6372
*[[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] DBR-T200, DBR-T210
*[[Sony]] VTX-D500U
*[[Toshiba]] DTB2000

All these set top boxes (and some ONdigital-branded integrated TVs) become obsolete after the digital switchover, completed in 2012, as post-switchover broadcasts utilised a newer 8k modulation scheme with which this earlier equipment was not compatible.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==iDTVs==
ONdigital and ITV Digital could also be received with an [[Integrated Digital Television]] (iDTV) receiver. They used a [[conditional-access module]] (CAM) with a smart card, plugged into a DVB [[Common Interface]] slot in the back of the set.

Purchasers of iDTVs were given a substantially discounted price on using the ONdigital service, as there was no cost for a set-top box.

Some of the original iDTVs needed firmware upgrades to work with the CAM. For example, [[Sony]] sent technicians out to homes to make the necessary updates free of charge.

==Carlton/Granada digital television channels==
Carlton and Granada (later ITV Digital Channels Ltd) created a selection of channels which formed some of the core content of channels available via the service, which were:

'''Rennes''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛn|-|Fr-Paris--Rennes.ogg}}; {{lang-br|Roazhon}} {{IPA-br|ˈrwɑːzən|}}; [[Gallo language|Gallo]]: ''Resnn''; {{Lang-la|Condate Redonum}}) is a city in the east of [[Brittany]] in northwestern [[France]] at the confluence of the [[Ille]] and the [[Vilaine]]. Rennes is the capital of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]], as well as the [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] [[Departments of France|department]]. In 2015, the city was [[Urban area (France)|the tenth largest in France]], with a [[metropolitan area]] of about 720,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=17914#trois] INSEE.fr&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Rennes are called Rennais(e)(es) in French

Rennes's history goes back more than 2,000 years, at a time when it was a small Gallic village named Condate. Together with [[Vannes]] and [[Nantes]], it was one of the major cities of the ancient [[Duchy of Brittany]]. From the early sixteenth century until the [[French Revolution]], Rennes was a parliamentary, administrative and garrison city of the historic province of [[Brittany]] of the [[Kingdom of France]] as evidenced by its 17th century [[Parliament of Brittany|Parliament's Palace]]. Rennes played an important role in the Stamped Paper Revolt in 1675. After the destructive fire of 1720, the medieval wooden center of the city was partially rebuilt in stone. Remaining mostly [[Rural area|rural]] until the [[World War II|Second World War]], Rennes really developed in the twentieth century. 

Since the 1950s, Rennes has grown in importance through [[rural flight]] and its modern industrial development, partly automotive. The city developed extensive building plans to accommodate upwards of 200,000 inhabitants. During the 1980s, Rennes became one of the main centres in [[telecommunication]] and high technology industry. It is now a significant [[Digital economy|digital]] innovation centre in France. In 2002, Rennes became the smallest city in the world to have a [[Rennes Metro|Metro]] line. 

Labeled a city of art and history, it has preserved an important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Classical architecture|classical]] heritage within its historic center with over 90 buildings  protected as historic monuments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ministère de la Culture - Maintenance|url=http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/redir_pop/index.html?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=INSEE&amp;DOM=MH&amp;VALUE_1=35238|access-date=2020-10-31|website=www2.culture.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Berle later described this series as &quot;the best radio show I ever did ... a hell of a funny variety show&quot;. It served as a springboard for Berle's emergence as television's first major star.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioArchives2011&quot;/&gt;

===Mr. Television===
Berle first appeared on television in 1929 in an experimental broadcast in [[Chicago]] which he hosted in front of 129 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/miltonberle.htm|title=The Milton Berle Show|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814194644/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/miltonberle.htm|archive-date=2016-08-14|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would return to television 20 years later, becoming the first major American television star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/business/technology/story/1336054.html &quot;Broadcast pioneer NBC prepares for cable takeover&quot;] ''Miami Herald'', Nov. 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle would revive the structure and routines of his vaudeville act for his debut on commercial TV, hosting The ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]'' on June 8, 1948 over the [[NBC]] Television Network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epstein2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madigan2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sackett, Susan (1993) p.1954 quotation: {{quote|. When the program premiered on Tuesday, June 8, 1948 on [[NBC]] Television, the format was strictly vaudeville, with dancers, jugglers, acrobats and guest stars in sketches--in short, a close approximation of the show that Berle was already doing for ABC on Wednesday nights.&lt;/ref&gt;  They did not settle on Berle as the permanent host right away; he was originally part of a rotation of hosts (Berle himself had only a four-week contract). Comedian Jack Carter was host for August. Berle was named the permanent host that fall. Berle's highly visual style, characterized by vaudeville slapstick and outlandish costumes, proved ideal for the new medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2010p706&quot;&gt;Young, William H. and Young, Nancy K. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&amp;pg=PA706 ''World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], p.706 quotation: {{quote|Radio exists as an aural medium, and no matter how physically animated a performer may be or how clownish his or her costume ... Berle's comedic gift shone in slapstick, something he had mastered in his vaudeville experiences. Many radio stars found it difficult to make the transition to TV ... Not so Berle. Radio had confined the comedian, making him reliant on his wealth of jokes and little else. ... Berle clearly considered no costume too outlandish, no stunt too foolish.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle modeled the show's structure and skits directly from his vaudeville shows, and hired writer Hal Collins to revive his old routines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epstein2002&quot;&gt;Epstein, Lawrence J. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iTarGWLM5CEC&amp;pg=PT86 ''The Haunted Smile: The Story of Jewish Comedians in America''], ch.6 ''The Magic Box'', pp. 86–7, quotation: {{quote|Berle had hired the writer Hal Collins to revive old vaudeville, burlesque and radio routines that Berle has used successfully. ... The shows were clearly vaudeville brought into the home. ... Berle was the ringmaster, the master of ceremonies who did his opening monologue and introduced each new act. Keeping to his own vaudeville tradition of entering into the acts of other performers, Berle often interrupted or joined in the act. When &quot;Buffalo Bob&quot; Smith came on, Berle appeared dressed as Howdy Doody.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madigan2001&quot;&gt;Madigan, S.P.

{{quote|Texaco Star emulated a vaudeville variety hour, with several guests each week, including singers, comedians, ventriloquists, acrobats, dramatic performances, and so forth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle dominated Tuesday night television for the next several years, reaching the number one slot in the [[Nielsen ratings]] with as much as a 97% share of the viewing audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/fifties00halb |chapter=Ch.

Fewer movie tickets were sold on Tuesdays. Some theaters, restaurants, and other businesses shut down for the hour or closed for the evening so their customers would not miss Berle's antics.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmuseum&quot;/&gt; Berle's autobiography notes that in [[Detroit]], &quot;an investigation took place when the water levels took a drastic drop in the reservoirs on Tuesday nights between 9 and 9:05.

Television set sales more than doubled after ''Texaco Star Theatre''{{'}}s debut, reaching two million in 1949. Berle's stature as the medium's first superstar earned him the sobriquet &quot;Mr. Television&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmuseum&quot;/&gt; He also earned another nickname after ending a 1949 broadcast with a brief ad-libbed remark to children watching the show: &quot;Listen to your Uncle Miltie and go to bed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Milton Berle: An Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/miltonberleautob00berl_0|url-access=registration|editor-last=Berle|editor-first=Milton|editor2-last=Frankel|editor2-first=Haskel|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1974|pages=[https://archive.org/details/miltonberleautob00berl_0/page/337 337]|isbn=0-440-05609-8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Craig]] and [[Kermit Goell]]'s ''[[Near You]]'' became the theme song that closed Berle's TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/texacoStarTheater.html|title=Texaco Star Theater / The Milton Berle Show|work=classicthemes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berle risked his newfound TV stardom at its zenith to challenge Texaco when the sponsor tried to prevent black performers from appearing on his show:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember clashing with the advertising agency and the sponsor over my signing [[the Four Step Brothers]] for an appearance on the show. The only thing I could figure out was that there was an objection to black performers on the show, but I couldn't even find out who was objecting. &quot;We just don't like them,&quot; I was told, but who the hell was &quot;we&quot;? Because I was riding high in 1950, I sent out the word: &quot;If they don't go on, I don't go on.&quot; At ten minutes of eight—ten minutes before showtime—I got permission for the Step Brothers to appear. If I broke the color-line policy or not, I don't know, but later on I had no trouble booking [[Bill Robinson]] or [[Lena Horne]].&lt;ref&gt;Milton Berle, Haskel Frankel (1974)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0BaAAAAMAAJ ''Milton Berle: an autobiography, with Haskel Frankel''] p.285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berle's mother Sadie was often in the audience for his broadcasts; she had long served as a &quot;plant&quot; to encourage laughter from his stage show audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;childwonder&quot;/&gt; Her unique, &quot;piercing, roof-shaking laugh&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;childwonder&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruth/&gt; would stand out, especially when Berle made an entrance in an outrageous costume. After feigning surprise he would &quot;ad lib&quot; a response; for example: &quot;Lady, you've got all night to make a fool of yourself. I've only got an hour!&quot;

Berle asked NBC to switch from live broadcasts to film, which would have made possible reruns (and residual income from them); he was angered when the network refused. However, NBC did consent to make a [[kinescope]] of each show. Later, Berle was offered 25% ownership of the [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] by its inventor, [[Irving Berlin Kahn]], if he would replace [[cue cards]] with the [[teleprompter|eponymous new device]] on his program. He turned the offer down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SWcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mwEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7291,3455107&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Berle Recalls Beginning of TV|date=13 June 1968|author=Humphrey, Hal|newspaper=Toledo Blade|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequent user of tranquilizers, Berle frequently endorsed [[Meprobamate|Miltown]] on his show, and became one of the main figureheads promoting the drug in 1950s America. Due to his promotion of the drug, Berle was dubbed &quot;Uncle Miltown&quot; by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302287405|title=The age of anxiety: a history of America's turbulent affair with tranquilizers|last=1964-|first=Tone, Andrea,|date=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780786727476|location=New York|oclc=302287405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berle's contribution to television, he was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkoffame.com/milton-berle/|title=Milton Berle|date=2019-10-25|website=Hollywood Walk of Fame|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV decline===
At one million dollars a year, NBC signed him to an exclusive, unprecedented 30-year television contract in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/03/19/archives/30year-contract-is-signed-by-berle-nbc-to-have-first-call-on.html|title=30-YEAR CONTRACT IS SIGNED BY BERLE; N.B.C. to Have First Call on Services as Actor, Director, Writer or Producer|date=1951-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texaco pulled out of sponsorship of the show in 1953. [[Buick]] picked it up, prompting a renaming to ''The Buick-Berle Show'', and the program's format was changed to show the backstage preparations to put on a variety show. Critics generally approved of the changes, but Berle's ratings continued to fall, and Buick pulled out after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ecKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CVADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2406,1249723&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Berle Traded For Gleason|date=20 December 1954|newspaper=Prescott Evening Courier|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, &quot;Berle's [[persona]] had shifted from the impetuous and aggressive style of the ''Texaco Star Theater'' days to a more cultivated, but less distinctive personality, leaving many fans somehow unsatisfied.&quot;&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;

By the time the again-renamed ''Milton Berle Show'' finished its only full season (1955&amp;ndash;56), Berle was already becoming history—though his final season was host to two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s earliest television appearances, April 3 and June 5, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html Milton Berle — Milton Berle Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123000046/http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html |date=2007-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final straw during that last season may have come from CBS scheduling ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'' opposite Berle. Silvers was one of Berle's best friends in show business and had come to CBS's attention in an appearance on Berle's program. ''Bilko's'' creator-producer, Nat Hiken, had been one of Berle's radio writers.

Berle knew that NBC had already decided to cancel his show before Presley appeared.&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Moon Boys — The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 52. {{ISBN|1-55652-614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle later appeared in the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' series from 1958 to 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zTwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-eQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6842,4109474&amp;dq=milton+berle+son&amp;hl=en|title=Milton Berle Not Moping|author=Torre, Marie|date=11 March 1959|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but NBC was finding increasingly fewer showcases for its one-time superstar. By 1960, he was reduced to hosting a [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]] program, ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'', delivering his quips and interviewing celebrities between the efforts of that week's bowling contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LBIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YpwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4633,5663479&amp;dq=goodman+ace&amp;hl=en|title=Berle's 'Jackpot Bowling' Is A Really Striking Series|author=Ashe, Isobel|date=27 November 1960|newspaper=Reading Eagle|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life after ''The Milton Berle Show''===
[[Image:Leavelaugh.jpg|right]]
In Las Vegas, Berle played to packed showrooms at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Sands Hotel|the Sands]], the [[Desert Inn]], and other casino hotels. Berle had appeared at the [[Thunderbird (resort)|El Rancho]], one of the first Vegas hotels, in the late 1940s. In addition to constant club appearances, Berle performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[Herb Gardner]]'s ''[[The Goodbye People]]'' in 1968. He also became a commercial spokesman for the thriving [[Lum's|Lum's restaurant]] chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bionicdisco.com/2017/02/08/70s-spots-milton-berle-for-lums-restaurants-1975/|title=70s Spots: Milton Berle For Lums Restaurants (1975)|last=Moore|first=David|date=2017-02-08|website=Bionic Disco|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in numerous films, including ''[[Always Leave Them Laughing]]'' (released in 1949, shortly after his TV debut) with [[Virginia Mayo]] and [[Bert Lahr]], ''[[Let's Make Love]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Yves Montand]], ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', ''[[The Loved One]]'', ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'', ''[[Who's Minding the Mint?]]'', ''[[Lepke]]'', [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' and ''[[Driving Me Crazy]]''.

Freed in part from the obligations of his NBC contract, Berle was signed in 1966 to a new, weekly variety series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show failed to capture a large audience and was cancelled after one season. He later appeared as guest villain [[List of Batman (TV series) episodes#Season 3|Louie the Lilac]] on ABC's ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' series. Other guest appearances included stints on ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

Like his contemporary [[Jackie Gleason]], Berle proved a solid dramatic actor and was acclaimed for several such performances, most notably his lead role in &quot;Doyle Against the House&quot; on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]'' in 1961, a role for which he received an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination. He also played the part of a blind survivor of an airplane crash in ''Seven in Darkness'', the first in ABC's ''[[ABC Movie of the Week|Movie of the Week]]'' series. He also played a dramatic role as a [[talent agent]] in ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'' (1966) and was one of the few actors in that movie to get good notices from critics.

During this period, Berle was named to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the greatest number of charity performances made by a show-business performer. Unlike the high-profile shows done by [[Bob Hope]] to entertain the troops, Berle did more shows, over a period of 50 years, on a lower-profile basis. Berle received an award for entertaining at stateside military bases in [[World War I]] as a child performer, in addition to traveling to foreign bases during [[World War II]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. The first charity [[telethon]] (for the [[Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation]]) was hosted by Berle in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000926/|title=Milton Berle|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent fixture at charity benefits in the Hollywood area, he was instrumental in raising millions for charitable causes.

===Late career===
On April 14, 1979, Berle guest-hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Berle's long reputation for taking control of an entire television production—whether invited to do so or not—was a cause of stress on the set. &lt;!--In Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller's ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'',--&gt; One of the show's writers, [[Rosie Shuster]], described the rehearsals for the Berle ''SNL'' show and the telecast as &quot;watching a comedy train accident in slow motion on a loop.&quot; Upstaging, camera mugging, doing [[spit-take]]s, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of &quot;[[September Song]]&quot; complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer [[Lorne Michaels]] had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again. The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003, because Michaels thought it brought down the show's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1 Infamous moments in ''Saturday Night Live'' history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722084110/http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1 |date=2012-07-22 }} at zimbio.com, retrieved June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120917165422/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-bestworstsnl/11/ Best and Worst 'SNL' Hosts] at xfinity.comcast.net, retrieved June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a guest star on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=078644259X|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berle was memorably upstaged by the heckling theatre critics [[Statler and Waldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PGfx3QAV64M|Milton Berle Vs. Statler &amp; Waldorf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Statler and Waldorf puppets were inspired by a character named Sidney Spritzer, played by comedian [[Irving Benson]], who regularly heckled Berle from a box seat during episodes of the 1960s ABC series. Milton Berle also made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as a used car dealer, taking Fozzie Bear's 1951 Studebaker in trade for a station wagon.

In 1974, Berle had a minor altercation with younger actor/comedian [[Richard Pryor]] when both appeared as guests on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. At the time, Berle was discussing the emotional fallout from an experience he had with impregnating a woman he was not married to, and having to decide whether or not they would keep the child. During his talk, Pryor let out a laugh, to which Berle took exception and confronted him, stating, &quot;I wish, I wish, Richard, that I could have laughed at that time at your age, when I was your age, the way you just laughed now, but I just couldn't ... I told you this nine years ago, and now I'll tell you on the air in front of millions of people: Pick your spots, baby.&quot; This prompted Pryor to mockingly quip back, &quot;All right, sweetheart&quot; in a Humphrey Bogart voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afflictor.com/2011/10/26/pick-your-spots-baby/|title=This website is currently unavailable.|website=Afflictor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milton Berle at the 41st Emmys.jpg|left|thumb|Berle at the [[41st Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1989]]
Another well-known incident of upstaging occurred during the 1982 [[Emmy Award]]s, when Berle and [[Martha Raye]] were the presenters of the Emmy for Outstanding Writing. Berle was reluctant to give up the microphone to the award's recipients, from ''[[Second City Television]]'', and interrupted actor/writer [[Joe Flaherty]]'s acceptance speech several times. After Flaherty made a joke, Berle replied sarcastically &quot;That's funny!&quot; However, Flaherty's response of &quot;Sorry, Uncle Miltie ... go to sleep&quot; flustered Berle.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SCTV Wins 1982 Emmy For Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4HXCyfcD6M&amp;t=140|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SCTV'' later created a parody sketch of the incident, in which Flaherty beats up a Berle look-alike, shouting, &quot;You'll never ruin another acceptance speech, Uncle Miltie!&quot;

In 1984, Berle appeared in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] in the video for [[Round and Round (Ratt song)|&quot;Round and Round&quot;]] by the 1980s metal band [[Ratt]] (his nephew Marshall Berle was then their manager).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratt: Round and Round|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4649346/|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a brief appearance in the band's &quot;Back For More&quot; video as a motorcyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratt: Back for More|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt8532376/|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, he appeared on NBC's ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'' (created by [[Steven Spielberg]]) in an episode called &quot;Fine Tuning&quot;. In this episode, friendly aliens from space receive TV signals from the Earth of the 1950s and travel to [[Hollywood]] in search of their idols, [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[Burns and Allen]], and Milton Berle. (When he realizes the aliens are doing his old material, Uncle Miltie is thunderstruck: &quot;Stealing from Berle? Is that even possible?&quot;) Speaking gibberish, Berle is the only person able to communicate directly with the aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fine Tuning|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511093/|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most popular performances in his later years was guest starring in 1992 in ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' as womanizing, wise-cracking patient Max Jakey. Most of his dialogue was improvised and he shocked the studio audience by mistakenly blurting out a curse word. He also appeared in an acclaimed and Emmy-nominated turn on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' as an aging comedian befriended by [[Steve Sanders (90210)|Steve Sanders]], who idolizes him, but is troubled by his bouts of senility due to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He also voiced the Prince of Darkness, the main antagonist in the Canadian animated television anthology special ''The Real Story of Au Clair De La Lune''. He also appeared in 1995 as a guest star in an episode of ''[[The Nanny]]'' in the part of her lawyer and great uncle.

Berle was again on the receiving end of an onstage gibe at the 1993 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] where [[RuPaul]] responded to Berle's reference of having once worn dresses himself (during his old television days) with the quip that Berle now wore diapers. A surprised Berle replied by recycling a line he had delivered to [[Henny Youngman]] on his ''Hollywood Palace'' show in 1966: &quot;Oh, we're going to [[ad lib]]? I'll check my brain and we'll start even.&quot;

==Berle offstage==

In 1947, Milton Berle founded the [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills]] at the old Savoy Hotel on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. Other founding members included [[Jimmy Durante]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Bing Crosby]]. In 1961, the club moved to [[Beverly Hills]]. The Friars is a private show business club famous for its celebrity members and [[roast (comedy)|roasts]], where a member is mocked by his club friends in good fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-09-22-ca-46294-story.html|title=Enter Laughing, Again|date=1996-09-22|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many of his peers, Berle's offstage lifestyle did not include drugs or drinking, but did include cigars, a &quot;who's who&quot; list of beautiful women, and a lifelong addiction to gambling, primarily [[horse racing]]. Some felt his obsession for betting on &quot;the ponies&quot; was responsible for Berle never amassing the wealth or business success of many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/29/guardianobituaries|title=Obituary: Milton Berle|date=2002-03-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he &quot;worked clean&quot; for his entire onstage and onscreen career, except for the infamous Friars Club private [[celebrity]] roasts, Berle was known offstage to have a colorful vocabulary and few limits on when it was used. He often criticized younger comedians like [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[George Carlin]] for their X-rated humor, and challenged them to be just as funny without the four-letter words.

Hundreds of younger comics, including several comedy superstars, were encouraged and guided by Berle. Despite some less than flattering stories{{Clarify|date=December 2019}} told about Berle being difficult to work with, his son, Bill, maintains that Berle was a source of encouragement and technical assistance for many new comics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Berle's son Bob backs up his brother's statement. He was present many times during Berle's Las Vegas shows and television guest appearances. Milton aided [[Fred Travalena]], [[Ruth Buzzi]], [[John Ritter]], [[Marla Gibbs]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Dick Shawn]] and [[Will Smith]]. At a taping of a ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' show episode, for example, [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]] recited a scripted joke routine to a studio audience, to little response. The director asked for a retake, and the Osmonds repeated the act, word for word, to even less response. A third attempt, with no variation, proved dismal—until Milton Berle, off-camera, went into the audience, pantomiming funny faces and gestures. Berle timed each gesture to coincide with an Osmond punchline, so the dialogue seemed to be getting the maximum laughs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Berle's autobiography contains many tales of his sexual exploits. He claimed relationships with numerous famous women, including actresses [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Betty Hutton]], columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]], and evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Joe|title=But Seriously, Folks, It's Uncle Miltie|date=14 February 1983|volume=16|issue=7|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INgBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=milton+berle+stealing+jokes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K46zUvb_OoTs2wWVpoD4DQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=milton%20berle%20stealing%20jokes&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The veracity of some of these claims has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R.L.

Berle guest-starred as Uncle Leo in the ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'' special &quot;[[Two Heads Are Better than None]]&quot;, which premiered in 2000. This would be his last acting role.

In April 2001 Berle announced that a malignant tumor had been found in his colon, but he had declined surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/News/04/25/berle.ill/index.html?related|title=Breaking News, Daily News and Videos – CNN.com|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berle's wife said the tumor was growing so slowly that it would take 10 to 12 years to affect him in any significant or life-threatening way.

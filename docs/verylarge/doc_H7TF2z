Japanese Americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics. More than 112,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were forced into interior camps. However, in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]], where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogawa, Dennis M 1991, page 135&quot;&gt;Ogawa, Dennis M. and Fox, Jr., Evarts C.

He appointed the [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]] (CWRIC) to investigate the camps. The Commission's report, titled ''Personal Justice Denied,'' found little evidence of Japanese disloyalty at the time and concluded that the incarceration had been the product of racism. It recommended that the government pay [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] to the internees. In 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed into law the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]] which apologized for the internment on behalf of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] and authorized a payment of $20,000 ({{Inflation|index=US|value=20,000|start_year=1988|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to each former internee who was still alive when the act was passed.

===Japanese Americans before World War II===
{{Further|Japanese-American life before World War II}}
Due in large part to socio-political changes stemming from the [[Meiji Restoration]]—and a recession caused by the abrupt [[opening of Japan]]'s economy to the world market—people began emigrating from the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1868 in order to find work to survive.&lt;ref name=Anderson-Immigration&gt;Anderson, Emily. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Immigration/ Immigration],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1869 to 1924 approximately 200,000 immigrated to the islands of Hawaii, mostly laborers expecting to work on the [[Hawaiian sugar plantations|islands' sugar plantations]]. Some 180,000 went to the U.S. mainland, with the majority settling on the West Coast and establishing farms or small businesses.&lt;ref name=Densho-about/&gt; Most arrived before 1908, when the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]] between Japan and the United States banned the immigration of unskilled laborers. A loophole allowed the wives of men already in the US to join their husbands. The practice of women marrying by proxy and immigrating to the U.S. resulted in a large increase in the number of &quot;[[picture bride]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=Anderson-Immigration/&gt;&lt;ref name='picture brides'&gt;Nakamura, Kelli Y. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Picture_brides/],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Japanese-American population continued to grow, European Americans on the West Coast resisted the new group, fearing competition and exaggerating the idea of hordes of Asians keen to take over white-owned farmland and businesses. Groups such as the [[Exclusion League|Asiatic Exclusion League]], the [[California Joint Immigration Committee]], and the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]] organized in response to this &quot;[[Yellow Peril]].&quot; They lobbied successfully to restrict the property and citizenship rights of Japanese immigrants, as similar groups had previously organized against Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name='Anti-Japanese exclusion movement'&gt;Anderson, Emily. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Anti-Japanese%20exclusion%20movement/ Anti-Japanese exclusion movement],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Several laws and treaties attempting to slow immigration from Japan were introduced beginning in the late 19th century. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]], following the example of the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], effectively banned all immigration from Japan and other &quot;undesirable&quot; Asian countries.

The 1924 ban on immigration produced unusually well-defined generational groups within the Japanese-American community. The ''[[Issei]]'' were exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924; some desired to return to their homeland. Because no new immigration was permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were, by definition, born in the U.S. and automatically U.S. citizens. This ''[[Nisei]]'' generation were a distinct cohort from their parents. In addition to the usual generational differences, Issei men had been typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives, making them significantly older than the younger children of their often large families.&lt;ref name='picture brides'/&gt; U.S. law prohibited Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens, making them dependent on their children to rent or purchase property. Communication between English-speaking children and parents who spoke mostly or completely in Japanese was often difficult. A significant number of older Nisei, many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban, had married and already started families of their own by the time the US joined World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese American Internment during World War II: A History and Reference Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/japaneseamerican00ngwe|url-access=registration|last=Ng|first=Wendy|publisher=Greenwood|year=2002|location=Westport, CT|pages=[https://archive.org/details/japaneseamerican00ngwe/page/n37 8]–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite racist legislation that prevented Issei from becoming naturalized citizens (and therefore from [[Alien land laws|owning property]], voting, or running for political office), these Japanese immigrants established communities in their new hometowns. Japanese Americans contributed to the agriculture of California and other Western states, by introducing irrigation methods that enabled the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and flowers on previously inhospitable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iwata |first1=Masakazu |date=1962 |title=The Japanese immigrants in California agriculture |journal=Agricultural History |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=25–37 |jstor=3740395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both rural and urban areas, ''kenjinkai,'' community groups for immigrants from the same [[Japanese prefecture]], and ''[[Buddhist Women's Association|fujinkai]],'' Buddhist women's associations, organized community events and charitable work, provided loans and financial assistance and built [[Japanese language education in the United States|Japanese language schools]] for their children. Excluded from setting up shop in white neighborhoods, [[Japanese diaspora|nikkei]]-owned small businesses thrived in the ''[[Nihonmachi]],'' or Japantowns of urban centers, such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Seattle]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the 1930s the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI), concerned by Imperial Japan's rising military power in Asia, began conducting surveillance on Japanese-American communities in Hawaii. From 1936, at the behest of President Roosevelt, the ONI began compiling a &quot;special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a [[concentration camp]] in the event of trouble&quot; between Japan and the United States. In 1939, again by order of the President, the ONI, [[Military Intelligence Division (United States)|Military Intelligence Division]], and [[FBI]] began working together to compile a larger [[FBI Index#Custodial Detention Index|Custodial Detention Index]].&lt;ref name=Kashima-ABClist&gt;Kashima, Tetsuden. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial%20detention%20/%20A-B-C%20list/ Custodial detention / A-B-C list],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

The surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, led military and political leaders to suspect that [[Imperial Japan]] was preparing a [[Invasion of the United States#Imperial_Japan|full-scale invasion of Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/what-happened-after-the-attack-of-pearl-harbor |website=www.historyonthenet.com |access-date=17 September 2020 |title=What Happened After the Attack of Pearl Harbor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Japan's [[Pacific War#Japanese offensives, 1941–42|rapid military conquest]] of a large portion of Asia and the Pacific including a small portion of the U.S. West Coast (i.e., [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]) between 1937 and 1942, some Americans{{Who|date=May 2020}} feared that its military forces were unstoppable.

American public opinion initially stood by the large population of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' characterizing them as &quot;good Americans, born and educated as such.&quot; Many Americans believed that their loyalty to the United States was unquestionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Irons, Peter. | title=Justice At War: The Story of the Japanese American Internment Cases | publisher=University of Washington Press | year=1993 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/justiceatwarthes00iron/page/7 7]–9 | url=https://archive.org/details/justiceatwarthes00iron | url-access=registration |isbn= 9780520083127}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, six weeks after the attack, public opinion along the Pacific began to turn against Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, as the press and other Americans{{citation needed|reason=Which other Americans?|date=January 2017}} became nervous about the potential for [[fifth column]] activity. Though the administration (including President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]) dismissed all rumors of Japanese-American espionage on behalf of the Japanese war effort, pressure mounted upon the administration as the tide of public opinion turned against Japanese Americans. Although the impact on US authorities is controversial, the [[Niihau incident]] immediately followed the attack on Pearl Harbor, when Ishimatsu Shintani, an Issei, and Yoshio Harada, a Nisei, and his Issei wife Irene Harada on the island of Ni'ihau violently freed a downed and captured Japanese naval airman, attacking their fellow Ni'ihau islanders in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Several concerns over the loyalty of ethnic Japanese seemed to stem from [[racial prejudice]] rather than any evidence of malfeasance. The [[Roberts Commission]] report, which investigated the Pearl Harbor attack, was released on January 25 and accused persons of Japanese ancestry of espionage leading up to the attack.&lt;ref name=Conn1/&gt; Although the report's key finding was that General [[Walter Short]] and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]] had been derelict in their duties during the attack on Pearl Harbor, one passage made vague reference to &quot;Japanese consular agents and other... persons having no open relations with the Japanese foreign service&quot; transmitting information to Japan. It was unlikely that these &quot;spies&quot; were Japanese American, as Japanese intelligence agents were distrustful of their American counterparts and preferred to recruit &quot;white persons and Negroes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Niiya, Brian. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Magic%20cables/],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved August 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the fact that the report made no mention of Americans of Japanese ancestry, national and West Coast media nevertheless used the report to vilify Japanese Americans and inflame public opinion against them.&lt;ref name=Densho_RobComm&gt;Niiya, Brian. &quot;[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Roberts%20Commission%20report/],&quot; ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

Major [[Karl Bendetsen]] and Lieutenant General [[John L. DeWitt]], head of the [[Western Defense Command]], each questioned Japanese-American loyalty. DeWitt said:

{{quotation|The fact that nothing has happened so far is more or less . . . ominous, in that I feel that in view of the fact that we have had no sporadic attempts at sabotage that there is a control being exercised and when we have it&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; it will be on a mass basis.&lt;ref name=Conn1&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Conn | first1=Stetson | last2=Engelman| first2=Rose C.| last3=Fairchild| first3=Byron| title=Guarding the United States and its Outposts| url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Guard-US/index.htm#contents| series=United States Army in World War II| orig-year=1964| year=2000| publisher =Center of Military History, United States Army| location=Washington, D.C.| pages= 120–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He further stated in a conversation with California's governor, [[Culbert L. Olson]],

{{quotation|There's a tremendous volume of public opinion now developing against the Japanese of all classes, that is aliens and non-aliens, to get them off the land, and in Southern California around Los Angeles—in that area too—they want and they are bringing pressure on the government to move all the Japanese out. As a matter of fact, it's not being instigated or developed by people who are not thinking but by the best people of California. Since the publication of the Roberts Report they feel that they are living in the midst of a lot of enemies. They don't trust the Japanese, none of them.&lt;ref name=Conn1/&gt;}}

DeWitt, who administered the internment program, repeatedly told newspapers that &quot;A [[Jap]]'s a Jap&quot; and testified to Congress,

&lt;!-- This section should address the initial stages, including the curfew imposed after the military areas were defined; the exclusion zone definitions, and the steps toward removal. The voluntary resettlement policy and its response should be discussed here. --&gt;

Executive Order 9066, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized military commanders to designate &quot;military areas&quot; at their discretion, &quot;from which any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; These &quot;exclusion zones,&quot; unlike the &quot;alien enemy&quot; roundups, were applicable to anyone that an authorized military commander might choose, whether citizen or non-citizen. Eventually such zones would include parts of both the East and West Coasts, totaling about 1/3 of the country by area. Unlike the subsequent deportation and incarceration programs that would come to be applied to large numbers of Japanese Americans, detentions and restrictions directly under this Individual Exclusion Program were placed primarily on individuals of [[German-American internment|German]] or [[Italian-American internment|Italian]] ancestry, including American citizens.&lt;ref name=archives_aliens&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/immigration/enemy-aliens-overview.html |title=WWII Enemy Alien Control Overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913231431/http://www.archives.gov/genealogy/immigration/enemy-aliens-overview.html |archive-date=September 13, 2016 |work=archives.gov |access-date=January 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 1942, General John DeWitt, commanding general of the Western Defense Command, publicly announced the creation of two military restricted zones.&lt;ref name = &quot;JANM chrono&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Japanese American National Museum | url = http://www.janm.org/projects/clasc/chronology.htm | title = Chronology of WWII Incarceration | access-date = March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military Area No. 1 consisted of the southern half of Arizona and the western half of California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as all of California south of Los Angeles. Military Area No. 2 covered the rest of those states. DeWitt's proclamation informed Japanese Americans they would be required to leave Military Area 1, but stated that they could remain in the second restricted zone.&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoNiiya&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Brian | last = Niiya | url = http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Military%20Areas%201%20and%202 | title = Military Areas 1 and 2 | publisher = Densho | access-date = March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal from Military Area No. 1 initially occurred through &quot;voluntary evacuation.&quot;&lt;ref name = VoluntaryEvacuation/&gt; Japanese Americans were free to go anywhere outside of the exclusion zone or inside Area 2, with arrangements and costs of relocation to be borne by the individuals. The policy was short-lived; DeWitt issued another proclamation on March 27 that prohibited Japanese Americans from leaving Area 1.&lt;ref name='JANM chrono'/&gt; A night-time curfew, also initiated on March 27, 1942, placed further restrictions on the movements and daily lives of Japanese Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kashima2003&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

Included in the forced removal was [[Territory of Alaska|Alaska]], which, like Hawaii, was an incorporated U.S. territory located in the northwest extremity of the continental United States. Unlike the rest of the West Coast, Alaska was not subject to any exclusion zones due to its small Japanese population. Nevertheless, the Western Defense Command announced in April 1942 that all Japanese people and Americans of Japanese ancestry were to leave the territory for internment camps inland. By the end of the month, over 200 Japanese residents regardless of citizenship were exiled from Alaska, most of them ended up at the [[Minidoka National Historic Site|Minidoka War Relocation Center]] in [[Southern Idaho]].&lt;ref name = &quot;AlaskaJStor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Naske | first = Claus M | title = The Relocation of Alaska's Japanese Residents | journal = The Pacific Northwest Quarterly | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 124–29| date = July 1983 | publisher =[[Pacific Northwest Quarterly]] and the [[University of Washington]] | jstor = 40490551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eviction from the West Coast began on March 24, 1942, with Civilian Exclusion Order No. 1, which gave the 227 Japanese American residents of [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]] six days to prepare for their &quot;evacuation&quot; directly to Manzanar.&lt;ref name = &quot;DenshoBlankenship&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Blankenship | first = Anne | url = http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Bainbridge_Island%2C_Washington | title = Bainbridge Island, Washington | publisher = Densho | access-date = March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colorado]] governor [[Ralph Lawrence Carr]] was the only elected official to publicly denounce the internment of American citizens (an act that cost his reelection, but gained him the gratitude of the Japanese American community, such that [[Sakura Square#Bust of Governor Carr|a statue of him]] was erected in the [[Denver]] Japantown's [[Sakura Square]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Colorado&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradohistory.org/RIPsigns/show_markertext.asp?id=811 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002001303/http://www.coloradohistory.org/RIPsigns/show_markertext.asp?id=811 |archive-date=October 2, 2006 |title=The Colorado History Organization |access-date=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 108 exclusion orders issued by the Western Defense Command over the next five months completed the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast in August 1942.&lt;ref name = &quot;NiiyaDensho&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Brian | last = Niiya | url = http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Civilian%20exclusion%20orders | title = Civilian exclusion orders |  publisher = Densho | access-date = March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates and opponents of U.S. concentration camps==

===Non-military advocates for exclusion, removal, and detention===
[[File:Seuss cartoon.png|thumb|1942 editorial propaganda cartoon in the New York newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]'' by [[Dr. Seuss]] depicting Japanese Americans in [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]–states with the largest population of Japanese Americans–as prepared to conduct sabotage against the U.S.]]

The deportation and incarceration were popular among many white farmers who resented the Japanese American farmers. &quot;White American farmers admitted that their self-interest required removal of the Japanese.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taslitz&quot;/&gt; These individuals saw internment as a convenient means of uprooting their Japanese-American competitors. Austin E. Anson, managing secretary of the Salinas Vegetable Grower-Shipper Association, told the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1942:

{{quotation|
We're charged with wanting to get rid of the Japs for selfish reasons. We do. It's a question of whether the White man lives on the Pacific Coast or the brown men. They came into this valley to work, and they stayed to take over... If all the Japs were removed tomorrow, we'd never miss them in two weeks because the White farmers can take over and produce everything the Jap grows. And we do not want them back when the war ends, either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214#writing-USSC_CR_0323_0214_ZO |litigants = Korematsu v.

The [[Roberts Commission]] Report, prepared at President Franklin D. Roosevelt's request, has been cited as an example of the fear and prejudice informing the thinking behind the internment program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taslitz&quot;/&gt; The Report sought to link Japanese Americans with espionage activity, and to associate them with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taslitz&quot;/&gt; Columnist [[Henry McLemore]], who wrote for the [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst newspapers]], reflected the growing public sentiment that was fueled by this report:

{{quotation|
I am for the immediate removal of every Japanese on the West Coast to a point deep in the interior. I don't mean a nice part of the interior either. Herd 'em up, pack 'em off, and give 'em the inside room in the badlands... Personally, I hate the Japanese. And that goes for all of them.&lt;ref&gt;Neiwert, David. ''The Eliminationists: How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right''. 2009, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other California newspapers also embraced this view. According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial,
{{quotation|
A viper is nonetheless a viper wherever the egg is hatched... So, a Japanese American born of Japanese parents, nurtured upon Japanese traditions, living in a transplanted Japanese atmosphere...notwithstanding his nominal brand of accidental citizenship almost inevitably and with the rarest exceptions grows up to be a Japanese, and not an American... Thus, while it might cause injustice to a few to treat them all as potential enemies, I cannot escape the conclusion...that such treatment...should be accorded to each and all of them while we are at war with their race.&lt;ref&gt;Niiya, Brian. ''Japanese American History''. 1993, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
State politicians joined the bandwagon that was embraced by [[Leland Ford]] of Los Angeles, who demanded that &quot;all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in [inland] concentration camps.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taslitz&quot;/&gt;

Incarceration of Japanese Americans, who provided critical agricultural labor on the West Coast, created a labor shortage which was exacerbated by the induction of many white American laborers into the Armed Forces. This vacuum precipitated a mass immigration of Mexican workers into the United States to fill these jobs,&lt;ref&gt;Berberoglu, Berch. ''Labor and Capital in the Age of Globalization''. 2002, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; under the banner of what became known as the [[Bracero Program]]. Many Japanese internees were temporarily released from their camps – for instance, to harvest Western beet crops – to address this wartime labor shortage.&lt;ref&gt;Hanel, Rachael. ''The Japanese American Internment''. 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-military advocates against exclusion, removal, and detention===
Like many white American farmers, the white businessmen of Hawaii had their own motives for determining how to deal with the Japanese Americans, but they opposed internment. Instead, these individuals gained passage of legislation to retain in freedom the nearly 150,000 Japanese Americans who would have been otherwise sent to internment camps within Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Takaki, Ronald T. &quot;A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America&quot;. Boston: Little, Brown. 1993. Print, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only 1,200&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogawa, Dennis M 1991, page 135&quot;/&gt; to 1,800 Japanese Americans in Hawaii were interned.

The powerful businessmen of Hawaii concluded that imprisonment of such a large proportion of the islands' population would adversely affect the economic prosperity of the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takaki, Ronald T. 1993. page 379&quot;&gt;Takaki, Ronald T. &quot;A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America&quot;. Boston: Little, Brown 1993. Print, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese represented &quot;over 90 percent of the carpenters, nearly all of the transportation workers, and a significant portion of the agricultural laborers&quot; on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takaki, Ronald T. 1993. page 379&quot;/&gt;
General [[Delos Carleton Emmons]], the military governor of Hawaii, also argued that Japanese labor was &quot;'absolutely essential' for rebuilding the defenses destroyed at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Takaki, Ronald T. 1993. page 379&quot;/&gt; Recognizing the Japanese-American community's contribution to the affluence of the Hawaiian economy, General Emmons fought against the internment of the Japanese Americans and had the support of most of the businessmen of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takaki, Ronald T. 1993. page 379&quot;/&gt; By comparison, Idaho governor [[Chase A. Clark]], in a Lions Club speech on May 22, 1942, said &quot;Japs live like rats, breed like rats and act like rats. We don't want them ... permanently located in our state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fiset&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Thinning, Topping, and Loading: Japanese Americans and Beet Sugar in World War II |author=Louis Fiset |work=The Pacific Northwest Quarterly |date=Summer 1999 |issue=3 |access-date=16 August 2020 |url= http://www.jstor.com/stable/40492494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon's governor [[Charles A. Sprague]] was initially opposed to the internment, choosing to not enforce it in the state and encouraging residents to not harass their fellow citizens, the [[Nisei]]. He turned against the Japanese by mid-February 1942, days before the executive order, but regretted and tried to atone for this decision for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Charles Sprague's Internal Wars: Civil Liberties Challenges of an Editor and Governor |author=Floyd J.

Coming to different conclusions about how to deal with the Japanese-American community, both the white farmers of the continental United States and the white businessmen of Hawaii placed priority on protecting their own economic interests.

Though internment was a generally popular policy in California, support was not universal. [[R.C. Hoiles]], publisher of the ''[[Orange County Register]]'', argued during the war that the internment was unethical and unconstitutional:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would seem that convicting people of disloyalty to our country without having specific evidence against them is too foreign to our way of life and too close akin to the kind of government we are fighting…. We must realize, as [[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Henry Emerson Fosdick]] so wisely said, 'Liberty is always dangerous, but it is the safest thing we have.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoiles|first1=R.C.|title=In his own words: R.C.

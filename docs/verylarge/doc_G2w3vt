Rarer spellings include ''Alauni'' or ''Halani''. The Alans were also known over the course of their history by another group of related names including the variations ''Asi'', ''As'', and ''Os'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''{{lang|ro|Iasi or Olani}}'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''{{transl|bg|Uzi}}'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''{{lang|hu|Jász}}'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ''{{transl|ru|Jasy}}'', [[Georgian language|Georgian]] ''{{transl|ka|Osi}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Sergiu Bacalov, ''Medieval Alans in Moldova'' / ''Consideraţii privind olanii (alanii) sau iaşii din Moldova medievală.

===Early Alans===
[[Image:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|Approximate extent of [[Scythia]] within the area of distribution of [[Eastern Iranian languages]] (shown in orange) in the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/topic/Scythian|title=Scythian - ancient people|website=britannica.com|access-date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Europe, AD 117–138. The Alani at the time were concentrated north of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (centre right).]]

The first mentions of names that historians link with the ''Alani'' appear at almost the same time in texts from the Mediterranean, Middle East and China.{{sfn|Alemany|2000|p=?}}

In the 1st century AD, the Alans migrated westwards from [[Central Asia]], achieving a dominant position among the Sarmatians living between the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy467&quot; /&gt; The Alans are mentioned in the Vologases inscription which reads that [[Vologases I]], the Parthian king between around {{nbsp}}51 and 78 AD, in the 11th year of his reign (62 AD), battled [[Kuluk]], king of the Alani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostlanguages.com/parthian.htm Vologeses inscription.]
&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st century AD Jewish historian [[Josephus]] supplements this inscription. Josephus reports in the ''Jewish Wars'' (book{{nbsp}}7, ch.{{nbsp}}7.4) how Alans (whom he calls a &quot;[[Scythia]]n&quot; tribe) living near the [[Sea of Azov]] crossed the [[Gates of Alexander|Iron Gates]] for plunder (72{{nbsp}}AD) and defeated the armies of [[Pacorus II of Parthia|Pacorus]], king of [[Medes|Media]], and [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates]], King of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], two brothers of [[Vologases I of Parthia|Vologeses I]] (for whom the above-mentioned inscription was made):

{{quote|text=4. Now there was a nation of the Alans, which we have formerly mentioned somewhere as being Scythians, and living around [[Tanais]] and [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]]. This nation about this time laid a design of falling upon [[Medes|Media]], and the parts beyond it, in order to plunder them; with which intention they treated with the king of [[Hyrcania]]; for he was master of that [[Darial Gorge|passage]] which king [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] shut up with iron gates. This king gave them leave to come through them; so they came in great multitudes, and fell upon the [[Medes]] unexpectedly, and plundered their country, which they found full of people, and replenished with abundance of cattle, while nobody dared make any resistance against them; for Pacorus, the king of the country, had fled away for fear into places where they could not easily come at him, and had yielded up everything he had to them, and had only saved his wife and his concubines from them, and that with difficulty also, after they had been made captives, by giving a hundred talents for their ransom. These Alans therefore plundered the country without opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded as far as Armenia, laying waste all before them. Now, Tiridates was king of that country, who met them and fought them but was lucky not to have been taken alive in the battle; for a certain man threw a noose over him and would soon have drawn him in, had he not immediately cut the cord with his sword and escaped. So the Alans, being still more provoked by this sight, laid waste the country, and drove a great multitude of the men, and a great quantity of the other booty from both kingdoms, along with them, and then retreated back to their own country.}}

The fact that the Alans invaded [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] through [[Hyrcania]] shows that at the time many Alans were still based north-east of the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; By the early 2nd century AD the Alans were in firm control of the [[Volga River|Lower Volga]] and [[Kuban River|Kuban]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; These lands had earlier been occupied by the [[Aorsi]] and the [[Siraces]], whom the Alans apparently absorbed, dispersed and/or destroyed, since they were no longer mentioned in contemporaneous accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; It is likely that the Alans' influence stretched further westwards, encompassing most of the Sarmatian world, which by then possessed a relatively homogenous culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt;

In 135 AD, the Alans made a huge raid into [[Asia Minor]] via the Caucasus, ravaging Media and Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; They were eventually driven back by [[Arrian]], the [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], who wrote a detailed report (''Ektaxis kata Alanoon'' or 'War Against the Alans') that is a major source for studying Roman [[military tactics]].

From 215 to 250 AD, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Goths]] expanded south-eastwards and broke the Alan dominance on the [[Pontic Steppe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; The Alans however seem to have had a significant influence on Gothic culture, who became excellent horsemen and adopted the Alanic animal style art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; (The Roman Empire, during the chaos of the 3rd century civil wars, suffered damaging raids by the Gothic armies with their heavy cavalry before the [[Illyrian Emperors]] adapted to the Gothic tactics, reorganized and expanded the Roman heavy cavalry, and defeated the Goths under [[Gallienus]], [[Claudius II]] and [[Aurelian]]).

After the Gothic entry to the steppe, many of the Alans seem to have retreated eastwards towards the Don, where they seem to have established contacts with the [[Huns]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; Ammianus writes that the Alans were &quot;somewhat like the Huns, but in their manner of life and their habits they are less savage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; [[Jordanes]] contrasted them with the Huns, noting that the Alans &quot;were their equals in battle, but unlike them in their civilisation, manners and appearance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; In the late 4th century, [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]] conflates Alans and Huns in his military treatise{{snds}} ''Hunnorum Alannorumque natio'', the &quot;nation of Huns and Alans&quot;{{snds}}and collocates Goths, Huns and Alans, ''exemplo Gothorum et Alannorum Hunnorumque''.&lt;ref&gt;Vegetius 3.26, noted in passing by T.D. Barnes, &quot;The Date of Vegetius&quot; ''Phoenix'' '''33'''.3 (Autumn 1979, pp. 254–257) p. 256. &quot;The collocation of these three barbarian races does not recur a generation later&quot;, Barnes notes, in presenting a case for a late 4th-century origin for Vegetius' treatise.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th century Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] noted that the Alans were &quot;formerly called [[Massagetae]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]. [[Roman History]]. [[s:Roman History/Book XXXI#II|Book XXXI. II. 12]]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dio Cassius]] wrote that &quot;they are Massagetae.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; It is likely that the Alans were an amalgamation of various [[Iranian peoples]], including [[Sarmatians]], Massagetae and [[Saka]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; Scholars have connected the Alans to the nomadic state of [[Yancai]] mentioned in [[China|Chinese]] sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy465&quot; /&gt; The Yancai are first mentioned in connection with late 2nd century BC diplomat [[Zhang Qian|Zhang Qian's]] travels in Chapter 123 of ''[[Shiji]]'' (whose author, [[Sima Qian]], died c. 90 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy465&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Burton trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian by [[Sima Qian]]. Han Dynasty II.'' (Revised Edition), p. 234. [[Columbia University Press]]. New York. {{ISBN|0-231-08166-9}}; {{ISBN|0-231-08167-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Yancai of Chinese records has again been equated with the [[Aorsi]], a powerful Sarmatian tribe living between the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and the [[Aral Sea]], mentioned in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] records, in particular [[Strabo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy465&quot; /&gt;

===Link to ''Yancai''/''Alanliao''===
The Later [[Han dynasty]] Chinese chronicle, the ''[[Book of Later Han|Hou Hanshu]]'', 88 (covering the period 25–220 and completed in the 5th century),  mentioned a report that the steppe land ''Yancai'' had become a vassal state of the [[Kangju]] and was now known as ''Alanliao'' (阿蘭聊)&lt;ref&gt;Hill, John E. 2003. &quot;Annotated Translation of the Chapter on the Western Regions according to the ''Hou Hanshu''.&quot; Revised Edition&amp;nbsp;– to be published soon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Y. A. Zadneprovskiy suggests that the Kangju subjugation of Yancai occurred in the 1st century BC, and that this subjugation caused various Sarmatian tribes, including the Aorsi, to migrate westwards, which played a major role in starting the [[Migration Period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy465&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy463&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zadneprovskiy|1994|pp=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century [[Weilüe]] also notes that Yancai was then known to be Alans, although they were no longer vassals of the Kangju.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/weilue.html For an earlier version of this translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to Gaul===
[[File:Butler Migrations of the Barbarians.jpg|thumb|The migrations of the Alans during the 4th–5th centuries AD, from their homeland in the [[North Caucasus]]]]
Around 370, according to Ammianus, the peaceful relations between the Alans and Huns were broken, after the Huns attacked the Don Alans, killing many of them and establishing an alliance with the survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni de Marignolli, &quot;John De' Marignolli and His Recollections of Eastern Travel&quot;, in [https://archive.org/details/cathayandwaythi00marigoog ''Cathay and the Way Thither: Being a Collection of Medieval Notices of China''], Volume 2, ed. [[Henry Yule]] (London: The Hakluyt Society, 1866), 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt; These Alans successfully invaded the Goths in 375 together with the Huns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; They subsequently accompanied the Huns in their westward expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt;

Following the Hunnic invasion in 370, other Alans, along with other [[Sarmatians]], migrated westward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; One of these Alan groups fought together with the Goths in the decisive [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378{{nbsp}}AD, in which [[Roman emperor|emperor]] [[Valens]] was killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; As the Roman Empire [[Decline of the Roman Empire|continued to decline]], the Alans split into various groups; some fought for the Romans while other joined the Huns, [[Visigoths]] or [[Ostrogoths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt; A portion of the western Alans joined the [[Vandals]] and the [[Suebi]] in their invasion of Roman [[Gaul]]. [[Gregory of Tours]] mentions in his [[Liber historiae Francorum]] (&quot;Book of [[Franks|Frankish]] History&quot;) that the Alan king [[Respendial]] saved the day for the [[Vandals]] in [[Battle of Mainz (406)|an armed encounter]] with the [[Franks]] at the [[crossing of the Rhine]] on December{{nbsp}}31, 406). According to Gregory, another group of Alans, led by [[Goar]], crossed the Rhine at the same time, but immediately joined the Romans and settled in Gaul.

Under Beorgor ({{lang|la|Beorgor rex Alanorum}}), they moved throughout Gaul, till the reign of [[Petronius Maximus]], when they crossed the [[Alps]] in the winter of 464, into [[Liguria]], but were there [[Battle of Bergamo|defeated]], and Beorgor slain, by [[Ricimer]], commander of the Emperor's forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]], ''Observations on Daniel and The Apocalypse of St. John'' (1733).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Deacon]], ''Historia Romana'', XV, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 442, after it became clear to [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] that he could no longer rely upon the [[Huns]] for support, he turned to [[Goar]] and convinced him to move some of his people to settlements in the [[Orléanais|Orleanais]] in order to control the [[bacaudae]] of [[Armorica]] and to keep the [[Visigoths]] from expanding their territories northward across the [[Loire]]. [[Goar]] settled a substantial number of his followers in the [[Orléanais|Orleanais]] and the area to the north and personally moved his own capital to the city of [[Orléans|Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaGCbuuajFAC|title=A History of the Alans in the West|last=Bachrach|first=Bernard S.|date=1973|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816656998|pages=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Goar, they allied with the [[Burgundians]] led by [[Gundaharius]], with whom they installed the Emperor [[Jovinus]] as usurper. Under Goar's successor [[Sangiban]], the Alans of [[Orléans]] played a critical role in repelling the invasion of [[Attila the Hun]] at the [[Battle of Châlons]]. In 463 the Alans defeated the [[Goths]] at the [[Battle of Orleans (463)|battle of Orléans]], and they later defeated the [[Franks]] led by [[Childeric I|Childeric]] in 466.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaGCbuuajFAC|title=A History of the Alans in the West|last=Bachrach|first=Bernard S.|date=1973|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816656998|pages=77|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 502–503 [[Clovis I|Clovis]] attacked [[Armorica]] but was defeated by the Alans. However, the Alans, who were [[Chalcedonian]] Christians like Clovis, desired cordial relations with him to counterbalance the hostile [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths]] who coveted the land north of the [[Loire]]. Therefore, an accord was arranged by which Clovis came to rule the various peoples of Armorica and the military strength of the area was integrated into the Merovingian military.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbz9IyOvfPoC|title=Merovingian Military Organization, 481-751|last=Bachrach|first=Bernard S.|date=1972|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816657001|pages=10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hispania and Africa===

[[File:Alan kingdom hispania.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Kingdom of the Alans in Hispania (409–426 AD).]]

Following the fortunes of the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]] into the [[Iberian peninsula]] ([[Hispania]], comprising modern Portugal and Spain) in 409,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Atlas of the Classical World, 500 BC–AD 600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOzKGAAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|isbn=978-0-7607-1973-2|page=2.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Alans led by Respendial settled in the provinces of [[Lusitania]] and [[Hispania Carthaginensis|Carthaginensis]].&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Alani Lusitaniam et Carthaginiensem provincias, et Wandali cognomine Silingi Baeticam sortiuntur&quot;'' ([[Hydatius]])&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of the Alans was among the first [[Barbarian kingdoms]] to be founded. The [[Silingi|Siling]] Vandals settled in [[Baetica]], the Suebi in coastal [[Gallaecia]], and the [[Hasdingi|Asding]] Vandals in the rest of Gallaecia. Although the newcomers controlled Hispania they were still a tiny minority among a larger Hispano-Roman population, approximately 200,000 out of 6,000,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB Spain&quot; /&gt;

In 418 (or 426 according to some authors&lt;ref&gt;Castritius, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;), the Alan king, [[Attaces]], was killed in battle against the Visigoths, and this branch of the Alans subsequently appealed to the Asding Vandal king [[Gunderic]] to accept the Alan crown. The separate ethnic identity of Respendial's Alans dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;For another rapid disintegration of an ''ethne'' in the Early Middle Ages, see [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]]. (Pohl 1998:17f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of these Alans are thought to have remained in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], most went to North Africa with the [[Capture of Carthage (439)|Vandals in 429]]. Later the rulers of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in North Africa styled themselves ''Rex Wandalorum et Alanorum'' (&quot;King of the Vandals and Alans&quot;).

[[File:Vandal alan kingdom 526.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Kingdom of the Vandals and Alans in North Africa (526 AD).]]

There are some vestiges of the Alans '''in Portugal''',&lt;ref&gt;Milhazes, José. [http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&amp;visual=16&amp;rss=0 Os antepassados caucasianos dos portugueses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101100219/http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&amp;visual=16&amp;rss=0 |date=2016-01-01 }}&amp;nbsp;– [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;/ref&gt; namely in [[Alenquer, Portugal|Alenquer]] (whose name may be Germanic for the ''Temple of the Alans'', from &quot;Alan Kerk&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Xavier Fernándes. Topónimos e gentílicos, Volume 1, 1941, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose castle may have been established by them; the [[Alaunt]] is still represented in that city's coat of arms), in the construction of the castles of [[Castelo de Torres Vedras|Torres Vedras]] and [[Castle of Almourol|Almourol]], and in the city walls of [[Lisbon]], where vestiges of their presence may be found under the foundations of the [[Igreja de Santa Luzia (Lisbon)|Church of ''Santa Luzia'']].

In the Iberian peninsula the Alans settled in [[Lusitania]] ([[Alentejo]]) and the Cartaginense provinces. They became known in retrospect for their massive hunting and fighting dog of [[Molosser]] type, the [[Alaunt]], which they apparently introduced to Europe. The breed is extinct, but its name is carried by a Spanish breed of dog still called ''[[Alano Español|Alano]]'', traditionally used in [[boar]] hunting and [[cattle]] herding. The Alano name, however, has historically been used for a number of dog breeds in a few European countries thought to descend from the original dog of the Alans, such as the German mastiff (Great Dane) and the French Dogue de Bordeaux, among others.

===Medieval Alania===
{{Main|Alania}}
The Alans who remained in their original area of settlement north of the Caucasus (and for a time east of the [[Caspian Sea]] as well), came into contact and conflict with the [[Bulgars]], the [[Gökturks]], and the [[Khazars]], who drove most of them from the plains and into the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Alān | first1 = W. | last1 = Barthold | first2 = V. | last2 = Minorsky| encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of Islam, New Edition, Volume I: A–B | publisher = BRILL | location = Leiden and New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 978-90-04-08114-7 | page = 354 | url = http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/alan-SIM_0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alans converted to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodoxy]] in the first quarter of the 10th century, during the patriarchate of [[Nicholas I Mystikos]]. [[Al-Mas‘udi]] reports that they apostasized in 932, but this seems to have been short-lived. The Alans are collectively mentioned as Byzantine-rite Christians in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot;/&gt; The Caucasian Alans were the ancestors of the modern [[Ossetians]], whose ethnonym derives from the name ''Ās'' (very probably the ancient ''Aorsi''; al-Ma'sudi mentions ''al-Arsiyya'' as guards among the Khazars, and the Rus' called the Alans ''Yasi''), a sister tribe of the Alans. The ''[[Armenian Geography]]'' uses the name ''Ashtigor'' for the most westerly located Alans, a name which survives as ''Digor'' and still refers to the western division of the Ossetians. Furthermore, in Ossetian, ''Asi'' refers to the region around [[Mount Elbrus]], where they probably formerly lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI2&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Pontic_steppe_region_around_650_AD.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Pontic steppe]] in c. 650]]
Some of the other Alans remained under the rule of the Huns. Those of the eastern division, though dispersed about the steppes until late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times, were forced by the [[Mongols]] into the Caucasus, where they remain as the [[Ossetians]]. Between the 9th and 12th centuries, they formed a network of tribal alliances that gradually evolved into the Christian kingdom of [[Alania]]. Most Alans submitted to the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1239–1277. They participated in [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions of Europe]] and [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|the Song dynasty in Southern China]], and the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] under [[Mamai]] of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch Der Orientalistik By Agustí Alemany, Denis Sinor, Bertold Spuler, Hartwig Altenmüller, pp. 400–410{{Better source|reason=citation is not referenced properly &amp; work advocates Altaic theory, which is discredited|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1253, the Franciscan monk [[William of Rubruck]] reported numerous [[Europeans in Medieval China|Europeans in Central Asia]]. It is also known that 30,000 Alans formed the royal guard ([[Asud]]) of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] court in [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]] (Beijing). [[Marco Polo]] later reported their role in the Yuan dynasty in his book ''[[Il Milione]]''. It is said that those Alans contributed to a modern Mongol clan, [[Asud]]. [[John of Montecorvino]], archbishop of Dadu (Khanbaliq), reportedly [[Roman Catholicism in China|converted many Alans to Roman Catholic Christianity]] in addition to [[Armenians in China]].&lt;ref&gt;Roux, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/publications/medieval/vol2/guzman.html Christian Europe and Mongol Asia: First Medieval Intercultural Contact Between East and West ]&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland and Lithuania, Alans were also part of the powerful [[Clan of Ostoja]].

Against the Alans and the Cumans (Kipchaks), the Mongols used divide-and-conquer tactics by first telling the Cumans to stop allying with the Alans and, after the Cumans followed their suggestion, the Mongols then attacked the Cumans&lt;ref&gt;Sinor, Denis. 1999. &quot;The Mongols in the West&quot;.

The reason why the earlier Persian word tersa was gradually abandoned by the Mongols in favour of the Syro-Greek word arkon, when speaking of Christians, manifestly is that no specifically Greek Church was ever heard of in China until the Russians had been conquered; besides, there were large bodies of Russian and Alan guards at Peking throughout the last half of the thirteenth and first half of the fourteenth century, and the Catholics there would not be likely to encourage the use of a Persian word which was most probably applicable in the first instance to the Nestorians they found so degenerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker1905&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Harper Parker|title=China and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP4xuxY0B2QC&amp;q=alan+guard+mongols&amp;pg=PA232|year=1905|publisher=E.

It is believed that some Alans resettled to the North ([[Barsils]]), merging with [[Volga Bulgars]] and [[Burtas]], eventually transforming to [[Volga Tatars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|ru}} [http://kitap.net.ru/bayar.php Тайная история татар] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927151902/http://kitap.net.ru/bayar.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unverifiable|date=June 2013}} It is supposed that the Iasi, a group of Alans founded a town in the northeast of Romania (about 1200–1300),  near the Prut river, called [[Iași]]. The latter became the capital of ancient [[Moldavia]] in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;A. Boldur, ''Istoria Basarabiei'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===
Descendants of the Alans, who live in the autonomous republics of Russia and Georgia, speak the [[Ossetian language]] which belongs to the [[Northeastern Iranian]] language group and is the only remnant of the [[Scytho-Sarmatian]] [[dialect continuum]], which once stretched over much of the [[Pontic steppe]] and [[Central Asia]]. Modern Ossetian has two major dialects: ''Digor'', spoken in the western part of North Ossetia; and ''Iron'', spoken in the rest of Ossetia. A third branch of Ossetian, ''[[Jassic dialect|Jassic]]'' (''Jász''), was formerly spoken in Hungary. The literary language, based on the [[Iron dialect]], was fixed by the [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[Kosta Khetagurov]] (1859–1906).

==Physical appearance==
The fourth-century Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote that the Alans were tall, and [[blond]]:

{{Quote|1=Nearly all the Alani are men of great stature and beauty; their hair is somewhat yellow, their eyes are terribly fierce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]. [[Roman History]]. [[s:Roman History/Book XXXI#II|Book XXXI. II. 21]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Genetics==
[[File:Ossetians.JPG|thumb|Ossetians]]
In a study conducted in 2014 by V. V.{{nbsp}}Ilyinskyon on bone fragments from 10 Alanic burials on the Don River, DNA could be abstracted from a total of seven. Four of them turned out to belong to yDNA Haplogroup G2 and six of them had mtDNA{{nbsp}}I. The fact that many of the samples share the same y- and mtDNA raises the possibility that the tested individuals belonged to the same tribe or even were close relatives. Nevertheless, this is a strong argument for direct Alan ancestry of [[Ossetians]], competing with the hypothesis that Ossetians are alanized Caucasic speakers, since the major Haplogroup among Ossetians is G2 also.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/7061155 |title = Афанасьев Г.Е., Добровольская М.В., Коробов Д.С., Решетова И.К.

In 2015 the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow conducted research on various Sarmato-Alan and Saltovo-Mayaki culture Kurgan burials. In this analysis, the two Alan samples from the 4th to 6th century AD had yDNAs G2a-P15 and R1a-z94, while from the three Sarmatian samples from 2nd to 3rd century AD two had yDNA J1-M267 and one possessed R1a.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=z6AHBTuUfQao.kwOSocRsvcoo |title = ДДНК Сарматы, Аланы}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, the three Saltovo-Mayaki samples from 8th to 9th century AD turned out to have yDNAs G, J2a-M410 and R1a-z94 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/15713987 | title=Афанасьев Г.Е., Вень Ш., Тун С., Ван Л., Вэй Л., Добровольская М.В., Коробов Д.С., Решетова И.К., Ли Х..

A genetic study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in May 2018 examined the remains of six Alans buried in the [[Caucasus]] from ca. 100 AD to 1400 AD. The sample of Y-DNA extracted belonged to [[haplogroup R1]] and [[haplogroup Q-M242]]. One of the [[Q-M242]] samples found in Beslan, North Ossetia from 200 AD found 4 relatives among [[Chechens]] from the Shoanoy Teip.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yfull.com/tree/Q-YP4000/&lt;/ref&gt; The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to [[Haplogroup HV (mtDNA)|HV2a1]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4d3]], [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X2f]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H13a2c]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H5|H5]], and [[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)|W1]].{{sfn|Damgaard et al.|2018}}

==Archaeology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Archaeological finds support the written sources. P. D. Rau (1927) first identified late Sarmatian sites with the historical Alans. Based on the archaeological material, they were one of the Iranian-speaking nomadic tribes that began to enter the Sarmatian area between the middle of the 1st and the 2nd centuries.

==Language==
The ancient language of the Alans was an [[Eastern Iranian|Eastern Iranian dialect]] either identical, or at least closely related, to ancient Eastern Iranian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;pg=PA303|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|last1=Mallory|first1=J.

==Religion==
[[File:Assumpt monastery church.JPG|thumb|Orthodox church in [[North Ossetia-Alania]]]]
Prior to their Christianisation, the Alans were Indo-Iranian polytheists, subscribing either to the poorly understood [[Scythian religion|Scythian pantheon]] or to a polytheistic form of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Some traditions were directly inherited from the Scythians, like embodying their dominant god in elaborate rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Sulimirski, T. (1985). &quot;The Scyths&quot; in: Fisher, W. B. (Ed.) The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 2: The Median and Achaemenian Periods. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20091-1}}. pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th{{nsndns}}5th centuries the Alans were at least partially Christianized by Byzantine missionaries of the [[Arianism|Arian]] church. In the 13th century, invading [[Mongol]] hordes pushed the eastern Alans further south into the Caucasus, where they mixed with native Caucasian groups and successively formed three territorial entities each with different developments. Around 1395 [[Timur]]'s army invaded the [[Northern Caucasus]] and massacred much of the Alanian population.

=== Allergy treatment ===
Histamine plays a role in wakefulness in the brain.

=== Acupuncture ===
A review of the evidence in 2012 concluded that current research is not rigorous enough to make recommendations around the use of [[acupuncture]] for [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CheukEtalAcupuncture&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Acupuncture for insomnia |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |last1=Cheuk |first1=Daniel KL |last2=Yeung |first2=Wing-Fai |last3=Chung |first3=Kf |last4=Wong |first4=Virginia |date=2012-09-12 |issn=1465-1858 |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd005472.pub3 |pmid=22972087 |volume=9 |issue = 9|pages=CD005472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pooled results of two trials on acupuncture showed a moderate likelihood that there may be some improvement to sleep quality for individuals with a diagnosis insomnia.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheukEtalAcupuncture&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}} This form of treatment for sleep disorders is generally studied in adults, rather than children. Further research would be needed to study the effects of acupuncture on sleep disorders in children.

=== Hypnosis ===
Research suggests that [[hypnosis]] may be helpful in alleviating some types and manifestations of sleep disorders in some patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stradling&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0800578 |title=Controlled trial of hypnotherapy for weight loss in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea |year=1998 |last1=Stradling |first1=J |last2=Roberts |first2=D |last3=Wilson |first3=A |last4=Lovelock |first4=F |journal=International Journal of Obesity |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=278–81 |pmid=9539198|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Acute and chronic insomnia often respond to relaxation and hypnotherapy approaches, along with sleep hygiene instructions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ng&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18797562 |year=2008 |last1=Ng |first1=Beng-Yeong |last2=Lee |first2=Tih-Shih |title=Hypnotherapy for Sleep Disorders |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=683–8 |journal=Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/37VolNo8Aug2008/V37N8p683.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypnotherapy]] has also helped with nightmares and sleep terrors.

=== Music therapy ===
{{Further|Music and sleep}}
Although more research should be done to increase the reliability of this method of treatment, research suggests that [[music therapy]] can improve sleep quality in [[Insomnia|acute]] and chronic sleep disorders. In one particular study, participants (18 years or older) who had experienced acute or chronic sleep disorders were put in a randomly controlled trial and their sleep efficiency (overall time asleep) was observed. In order to assess sleep quality, researchers used subjective measures (i.e. [[questionnaire]]s) and objective measures (i.e. [[polysomnography]]). The results of the study suggest that music therapy did improve sleep quality in subjects with acute or chronic sleep disorders, however only when tested subjectively. Although these results are not fully conclusive and more research should be conducted, it still provides evidence that music therapy can be an effective treatment for sleep disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=CF |date=2013-04-24 |title=Music therapy improves sleep quality in acute and chronic sleep disorders: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized studies |url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=12013020517 |journal=Centre for Reviews and Dissemination |doi=10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2013.03.008 |pmid=23582682 |access-date=2016-03-08 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=51–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, specifically looking to help people with insomnia, similar results were seen. The participants that listened to music experienced better sleep quality than those who did not listen to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Music for insomnia in adults|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 8|pages = CD010459|last1=Jespersen|first1=Kira V|last2=Koenig|first2=Julian|last3=Jennum|first3=Poul|last4=Vuust|first4=Peter|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd010459.pub2|pmid = 26270746|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to slower pace music before bed can help decrease the heart rate, making it easier to transition into sleep. Studies have indicated that music helps induce a state of relaxation that shifts an individual's [[Circadian rhythm|internal clock]] towards the sleep cycle. This is said to have an effect on children and adults with various cases of sleep disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/can-music-help-me-sleep|title=Can Music Help Me Sleep?|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/taking-note/can-music-make-you-a-productivity-powerhouse-9161721fced6|title=Can Music Make You a Productivity Powerhouse?|last=Evernote|date=2018-07-26|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is most effective before bed once the brain has been conditioned to it, helping to achieve sleep much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleep-newzzz/201812/the-many-health-and-sleep-benefits-music|title=The Many Health and Sleep Benefits Of Music|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Melatonin ===
In addressing sleep disorders and possible solutions, there is often a lot of buzz surrounding [[melatonin]]. Research suggests that melatonin is useful in helping people to fall asleep faster (decreased [[Sleep onset latency|sleep latency]]), to stay asleep longer, and to experience improved sleep quality. In order to test this, a study was conducted that compared subjects that had taken Melatonin to subjects that had taken a placebo pill in subjects with primary sleep disorders. Researchers assessed sleep onset latency, total minutes slept, and overall sleep quality in the Melatonin and placebo groups to note the differences. In the end, researchers found that melatonin decreased sleep onset latency and increased total sleep time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferracioli-Oda|first=E|date=2013-06-06|title=Meta-analysis: melatonin for the treatment of primary sleep disorders|url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=12013029090|journal=Centre for Reviews and Dissemination|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e63773|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063773|pmid=23691095|pmc=3656905|access-date=2016-03-08|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863773F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=12013029090|title=Meta-analysis: melatonin for the treatment of primary sleep disorders|website=www.crd.york.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had an insignificant and inconclusive impact on the quality of sleep compared to a placebo group.

== Sleep medicine ==
{{Main|Sleep medicine}}
Due to rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep in the 20th century, including the discovery of REM sleep in the 1950s and circadian rhythm disorders in the 70s and 80s, the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and sleep disorders had been founded, and a need for standards arose.

Specialists in Sleep Medicine were originally certified by the [[American Board of Sleep Medicine]], which still recognizes specialists. Those passing the Sleep Medicine Specialty Exam received the designation &quot;diplomate of the [[American Board of Sleep Medicine|ABSM]].&quot; Sleep Medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within [[internal medicine]], [[family medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] in the [[United States]]. Certification in Sleep Medicine shows that the specialist:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;has demonstrated expertise in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions that occur during sleep, that disturb sleep, or that are affected by disturbances in the wake-sleep cycle. This specialist is skilled in the analysis and interpretation of comprehensive polysomnography, and well-versed in emerging research and management of a sleep laboratory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abms.org/Who_We_Help/Physicians/specialties.aspx|title=American Board of Medical Specialties : Recognized Physician Specialty and Subspecialty Certificates|access-date=2008-07-21|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508025259/http://www.abms.org/who_we_help/physicians/specialties.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Competence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a myriad of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar [[symptom]]s such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional [[sleep deprivation]], &quot;is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder&quot;, such as sleep apnea, [[narcolepsy]], [[idiopathic hypersomnia]], [[Kleine–Levin syndrome]], menstrual-related hypersomnia, [[idiopathic]] recurrent stupor, or [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders|circadian rhythm disturbances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3810/pgm.2000.03.932 |title=What is causing excessive daytime sleepiness? Evaluation to distinguish sleep deprivation from sleep disorders |year=2000 |last1=Mahowald |first1=Mark |journal=Postgraduate Medicine |volume=107 |issue=3 |pmid=10728139 |pages=108–10, 115–8, 123|s2cid=42939232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms which can have a great many different causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Sleep dentistry ([[bruxism]], [[snoring]] and [[sleep apnea]]), while not recognized as one of the nine [[dentistry|dental specialties]], qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://aadsm.org/|title= About AADSM|access-date= 2008-07-22 |year= 2008 |publisher= Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep physicians at accredited sleep centers and can provide oral appliance therapy and upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abdsm.org/|title= About the ADBSM |access-date= 2008-07-22 |publisher= American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag.  Guardian.co.uk quotes the director of the [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust|Imperial College Healthcare]] Sleep Centre: &quot;One problem is that there has been relatively little training in sleep medicine in this country – certainly there is no structured training for sleep physicians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last= Wollenberg |title= Time to wake up to sleep disorders |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/health |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |date= July 28, 2008 |access-date= 2008-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial College Healthcare site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/services/sleepservices/index.htm |title= Sleep services |access-date= 2008-08-02 |year= 2008 |publisher= Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081004181017/http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/services/sleepservices/index.htm |archive-date= 2008-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows attention to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and very few other sleep disorders. Some NHS trusts have specialist clinics for respiratory and/or neurological sleep medicine.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Children and Young Adults ===
According to one meta-analysis, the two most prevalent sleep disorders among children are [[Parasomnia|confusional arousals]] and [[Sleepwalking|sleep walking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Kevin A.|last2=Hathaway|first2=Nathanael E.|last3=Lettieri|first3=Christine F.|date=2014-03-01|title=Common sleep disorders in children|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0301/p368.html|journal=American Family Physician|volume=89|issue=5|pages=368–377|issn=1532-0650|pmid=24695508}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 17.3% of kids between 3 and 13 years old experience confusional arousals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; About 17% of children sleep walk, with the disorder being more common among boys than girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The peak ages of sleep walking are from 8 to 12 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; A different systematic review offers a high range of prevalence rates of [[Bruxism|sleep bruxism]] for children. Between 15.29 and 38.6% of preschoolers grind their teeth at least one night a week. All but one of the included studies reports decreasing bruxist prevalence as age increased as well as a higher prevalence among boys than girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Machado|first1=Eduardo|last2=Dal-Fabbro|first2=Cibele|last3=Cunali|first3=Paulo Afonso|last4=Kaizer|first4=Osvaldo Bazzan|date=2014|title=Prevalence of sleep bruxism in children: A systematic review|journal=Dental Press Journal of Orthodontics|volume=19|issue=6|pages=54–61|doi=10.1590/2176-9451.19.6.054-061.oar|issn=2176-9451|pmc=4347411|pmid=25628080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review noted 7-16% of young adults suffer from [[delayed sleep phase disorder]]. This disorder reaches peak prevalence when people are in their 20s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  Between 20 and 26% of adolescents report a [[sleep onset latency]] of &gt;30 minutes.  Also, 7-36% have difficulty initiating sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gradisar|first1=Michael|last2=Gardner|first2=Greg|last3=Dohnt|first3=Hayley|date=2011-02-01|title=Recent worldwide sleep patterns and problems during adolescence: A review and meta-analysis of age, region, and sleep|journal=Sleep Medicine|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.11.008|pmid=21257344|issn=1389-9457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asian teens tend to have a higher prevalence of all of these adverse sleep outcomes than their North American and European counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

=== Insomnia ===
Combining results from 17 studies on insomnia in China, a pooled prevalence of 15.0% is reported for the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Xiao-Lan|last2=Wang|first2=Shi-Bin|last3=Zhong|first3=Bao-Liang|last4=Zhang|first4=Ling|last5=Ungvari|first5=Gabor S.|last6=Ng|first6=Chee H.|last7=Li|first7=Lu|last8=Chiu|first8=Helen F.

Men and women residing in China experience insomnia at similar rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; A separate meta-analysis focusing on this sleeping disorder in the elderly mentions that those with more than one physical or psychiatric malady experience it at a 60% higher rate than those with one condition or less. It also notes a higher prevalence of insomnia in women over the age of 50 than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Juan Carlos|last2=Dzierzewski|first2=Joseph M.|last3=Alessi|first3=Cathy A.|date=December 30, 2014|title=Sleep Problems in the Elderly|journal=The Medical Clinics of North America|volume=99|issue=2|pages=431–439|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2014.11.013|issn=0025-7125|pmc=4406253|pmid=25700593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study that was resulted from a collaboration between [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and Merck describes the development of an algorithm to identify patients will sleep disorders using electronic medical records. The algorithm that incorporated a combination of structured and unstructured variables identified more than 36,000 individuals with physician-documented insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Development of an Algorithm to Identify Patients with Physician-Documented Insomnia |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=7862 | year=2018 | last1=Kartoun| first1=Uri |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-25312-z |pmid=29777125 |pmc=5959894 |bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7862K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obstructive Sleep Apnea ===
[[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (OSA) affects around 4% of men and 2% of women in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mirrakhimov|first1=Aibek E|last2=Sooronbaev|first2=Talant|last3=Mirrakhimov|first3=Erkin M|date=2013-02-23|title=Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in Asian adults: a systematic review of the literature|journal=BMC Pulmonary Medicine|volume=13|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1471-2466-13-10|issn=1471-2466|pmc=3585751|pmid=23433391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, this disorder is more prevalent among men.

Specifically, about 13.7% of the Indian population and 7% of Hong-Kong's population is estimated to have OSA.  The two groups experience daytime OSA symptoms such as difficulties concentrating, mood swings, or high blood pressure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090|title=Obstructive sleep apnea – Symptoms and causes – Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; at similar rates (prevalence of 3.5% and 3.57%, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== Sleep Paralysis ===
A systematic review states 7.6% of the general population experiences [[sleep paralysis]] at least once in their lifetime. Its prevalence among men is 15.9% while 18.9% of women experience it. When considering specific populations, 28.3% of students and 31.9% of psychiatric patients have experienced this phenomenon at least once in their lifetime. Of those psychiatric patients, 34.6% have [[panic disorder]]. Sleep paralysis in students is slightly more prevalent for those of Asian descent (39.9%) than other ethnicities (Hispanic: 34.5%, African descent: 31.4%, Caucasian 30.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sharpless|first1=Brian A.|last2=Barber|first2=Jacques P.|date=October 2011|title=Lifetime Prevalence Rates of Sleep Paralysis: A Systematic Review|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=15|issue=5|pages=311–315|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2011.01.007|issn=1087-0792|pmc=3156892|pmid=21571556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restless Leg Syndrome ===
According to one meta-analysis, the mean prevalence rate for North America and Western Europe is estimated to be 14.5±8.0%. Specifically in the United States, the prevalence of [[Restless legs syndrome|restless leg syndrome]] is estimated to be between 5 and 15.7% when using strict diagnostic criteria.

'''Castalia''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|l|i|ə}} ([[Ancient Greek]]: Κασταλία), in [[Greek mythology]], was a [[naiad]]-[[nymph]], a daughter of [[Achelous]] who inhabited the Castalian spring in Delphi. In older traditions, Castalian spring already existed by the time Apollo came to Delphi searching for Python.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the water was a gift to Castalia from the river [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephisus]]. Latin poet [[Lactantius Placidus]] in his commentary on [[Statius]]' ''[[Thebaid]]'' tells that to escape the amorous advances of [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], Castalia transformed herself into a fountain at [[Delphi]], at the base of Mount [[Parnassos]], or at [[Mount Helicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=Castalia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98355/Castalia}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Castalia could inspire the genius of [[poetry]] to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound; the sacred water was also used to clean the Delphian temples. Apollo consecrated Castalia to the [[Muses]] (''Castaliae Musae'').

The 20th century [[Germany|German]] writer [[Hermann Hesse]] used Castalia as inspiration for the name of the futuristic fictional utopia in his 1943 [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]''. Castalia is home to an austere order of [[intellectual]]s with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to nurture and play the Glass Bead Game.

'''Pollen''' is a powdery substance consisting of pollen grains which are male [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] of [[spermatophyta|seed plants]], which produce male [[gamete]]s (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of [[sporopollenin]] that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the [[stamen]]s to the [[gynoecium|pistil]] of flowering plants, or from the male [[Conifer cone|cone]] to the female cone of [[Pinophyta|coniferous plants]]. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it [[germinate]]s, producing a [[pollen tube]] that transfers the [[sperm]] to the [[ovule]] containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called [[palynology]] and is highly useful in [[paleoecology]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and [[Forensic science|forensics]]. 
Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the [[Stamen|anther]] of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pollination |volume=22 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Pollen is infrequently used as food and food supplement. Because of agricultural practices, it is often contaminated by agricultural pesticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A survey of honey bee-collected pollen reveals widespread contamination by agricultural pesticides|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|volume=615|pages=208–218|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.226|pmid=28968582|year=2018|last1=Tosi|first1=S.|last2=Costa|first2=C.|last3=Vesco|first3=U.|last4=Quaglia|first4=G.|last5=Guido|first5=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the [[pollen tube]], and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the [[microsporangia]] in the male cone of a conifer or other [[gymnosperm]] or in the anthers of an [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[flower]]. Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see [[electron micrograph]], right). Pollen grains of [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and [[spruce]]s are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the [[forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis'' spp.),{{which|date=February 2017}} is 2.5-5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (0.005&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.sporomex.co.uk/technology/51-pollenspores |title = Spores and Pollens}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corn pollen grains are large, about 90–100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 59743 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211287498 | year = 2001 | title = Corn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11919–24 | pmid = 11559840 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | last1 = Pleasants| first1 = J.

In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.

In a process called '''microsporogenesis''', four haploid [[microspore]]s are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or [[meiocyte]]), after [[meiotic division]]. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed before [[cytokinesis]], whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the [[monocots]] is successive, but there are important exceptions.&lt;ref name=Furness2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|author-link2=Paula Rudall|title=Pollen and anther characters in monocot systematics|journal=Grana|date=January 2001|volume=40|issue=1–2|pages=17–25|doi=10.1080/00173130152591840|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature [[microgametophyte]]s containing the gametes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/development Pollen Development — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In some flowering plants,{{which|date=February 2017}} [[germination]] of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===
Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered [[cellulose]] called the '''endospore''' or '''intine''', and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of [[sporopollenin]] called the '''exospore''' or '''exine'''. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as '''spinulose''' (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as '''echinate'''. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as '''reticulate''', a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina). These reticulations may also be referred to as brochi.

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Pollen aperture evolution--a crucial factor for eudicot success?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=3|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2004.01.001|pmid=15003239|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5084}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. The process of shrinking the grain is called harmomegathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katifori|first1=Eleni|last2=Alben|first2=Silas|last3=Cerda|first3=Enrique|last4=Nelson|first4=David R.|last5=Dumais|first5=Jacques|date=27 April 2010|title=Foldable structures and the natural design of pollen grains|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/29361998/Foldable%20Structures.pdf?sequence=1|journal=PNAS|volume=107|issue=17|pages=7635–7639|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.7635K|doi=10.1073/pnas.0911223107|pmc=2867878|pmid=20404200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]]). Apertures that are more circular are called pores.

The orientation of furrows (relative to the original tetrad of microspores) classifies the pollen as '''sulcate''' or '''colpate'''. Sulcate pollen has a furrow across the middle of what was the outer face when the pollen grain was in its tetrad.&lt;ref name=Spor72/&gt; If the pollen has only a single sulcus, it is described as '''monosulcate''', has two sulci, as '''bisulcate''', or more, as '''polysulcate'''.&lt;ref name=Simp11&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C&amp;pg=PA453 |first1=Michael G. |last1=Simpson |title=Plant Systematics |chapter=Palynology|pages=453–464|publisher=Academic Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-08-051404-8 |access-date=6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singh1&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=142|page=142|chapter=Palynology|access-date=23 January 2014|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|isbn=9781578083510|last1=Singh|first1=Gurcharan|date=2004-01-01}} In {{Harvtxt|Singh|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Colpate pollen has furrows other than across the middle of the outer faces.&lt;ref name=Spor72&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Sporne, Kenneth R.  | year=1972 | title=Some Observations on the Evolution of Pollen Types in Dicotyledons | journal=New Phytologist | volume= 71 | issue=1 | pages=181–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1972.tb04826.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eudicots]] have pollen with three colpi ('''[[tricolpate]]''') or with shapes that are evolutionarily derived from tricolpate pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Judd, Walter S.  |author2=Olmstead, Richard G.  |name-list-style=amp |year = 2004|title = A survey of tricolpate (eudicot) phylogenetic relationships|journal = American Journal of Botany| volume = 91|pages = 1627–1644|doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1627|pmid=21652313|issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary trend in plants has been from monosulcate to polycolpate or polyporate pollen.&lt;ref name=Spor72/&gt;

Additionally, [[gymnosperm]] pollen grains often have air bladders, or vesicles, called '''sacci.''' The sacci are not actually balloons, but are sponge-like, and increase the [[buoyancy]] of the pollen grain and help keep it aloft in the wind, as most gymnosperms are [[Anemophily|anemophilous]]. Pollen can be '''monosaccate''', (containing one saccus) or '''bisaccate''' (containing two sacci). Modern [[pine]], [[Picea|spruce]], and [[Podocarpus|yellowwood]] trees all produce saccate pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paleopalynology|author=Traverse, Alfred|date=1988|publisher=Unwin Hyman|isbn=978-0045610013|oclc=17674795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure ('''''[[Carpel|pistil]]''''' in angiosperms) is called '''[[pollination]]'''. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as '''[[Anemophily|anemophilous]]''' (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. '''[[Entomophily|Entomophilous]]''' (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and [[protein]]-rich, for dispersal by [[insect]] [[pollinator]]s attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some [[mite]]s are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called [[palynivore]]s.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the [[Ovule|micropyle]], underneath the integuments of the ovule. A [[pollen tube]] is produced, which grows into the [[nucellus]] to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of [[Pinophyta]] and [[Gnetophyta]] are without [[flagella]], and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of [[Cycad]]ophyta and [[Ginkgophyta]] have many flagella.

When placed on the [[Carpel|stigma]] of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a [[pollen tube]], which grows down the tissue of the style to the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], and makes its way along the [[placenta]], guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an [[ovule]]. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the [[pollen tube]]. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during [[pollen tube]] growth appear to be efficiently [[DNA repair|repaired]] in the generative cell that carries the male [[genome|genomic information]] to be passed on to the next plant generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23550213&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T |title=DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth |journal=AoB Plants |volume=5 |pages=plt004 |year=2013 |pmid=23550213 |pmc=3583183 |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plt004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this [[DNA repair]] capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23550213&quot; /&gt;

==In the fossil record==
{{Main article|Palynology}}
Pollen's [[sporopollenin]] outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for [[biostratigraphy]] and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe|display-authors=etal|title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |publisher=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana 70, 1]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

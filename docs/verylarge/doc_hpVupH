'''John Bayard Anderson''' (February 15, 1922&amp;nbsp;– December 3, 2017) was an American politician from [[Illinois]]. As a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing [[Illinois's 16th congressional district]] from 1961 to 1981. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], he ran an [[Independent politician|independent]] campaign for president, receiving 6.6% of the popular vote.

Born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], Anderson practiced law after serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] during [[World War II]]. After a stint in the [[United States Foreign Service]], he won election as the State's Attorney for [[Winnebago County, Illinois]]. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1960 in a strongly Republican district. Initially one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the House, Anderson's views moderated during the 1960s, particularly regarding social issues. He became Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] in 1969 and remained in that position until 1979. He strongly criticized the [[Vietnam War]] as well as President [[Richard Nixon]]'s actions during the [[Watergate scandal]].

Anderson entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|1980 Republican presidential primaries]], introducing his signature campaign proposal of raising the [[Fuel taxes in the United States|gas tax]] while cutting [[Social Security (United States)#Taxation|social security taxes]]. He established himself as a contender for the nomination in the early primaries, but eventually dropped out of the Republican race, choosing to pursue an independent campaign for president. In the election, he finished third behind Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] and Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]]. He won support among [[Rockefeller Republican]]s, independents, liberal intellectuals, and college students.

After the election, he resumed his legal career and helped found [[FairVote]], an organization that advocates [[electoral reform]]s such as [[instant-runoff voting]]. He also won a lawsuit against the state of [[Ohio]], ''[[Anderson v. Celebrezze]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down early filing deadlines for independent candidates. Anderson served as a visiting professor at numerous universities and was on the boards of several organizations. He endorsed [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000 and helped found the [[Justice Party (United States)|Justice Party]] in 2012.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], where he grew up, the son of Mabel Edna (née Ring) and E. Albin Anderson. His father was a Swedish immigrant, as were his maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1980&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/26/archives/anderson-chooses-lucey-for-his-ticket-praises-exwisconsin-governor.html | work=The New York Times | title= Anderson Chooses Lucey for his Ticket; Praises Ex-Wisconsin Governor as Qualified for the White House Seeking Broader Support Anderson Picks Lucey, Ex-Governor of Wisconsin, as Running Mate Matter of Prominence Sees Effect on Congressmen Gives Carter 'No Chance' | date=August 26, 1980 | access-date=May 6, 2010 | first=Warren | last=Weaver Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/623990942.html?dids=623990942:623990942&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+06%2C+1980&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Wife+a+prime+mover+in+the+primary+campaign&amp;pqatl=google | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Wife a prime mover in the primary campaign | first=David | last=Axelrod | author-link=David Axelrod (political consultant) | date=March 6, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url= http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/anderson5.html |title=Index to Politicians: Anderson, J |website= The Political Graveyard |access-date=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Jim |date=2011 |title=No Holding Back: The 1980 John B.

==Early career==
Anderson was admitted to the Illinois [[bar (law)|bar]] the same year, and practiced law in Rockford.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; Soon after, he moved east to attend [[Harvard Law School]], obtaining a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; While at Harvard, he served on the faculty of [[Northeastern University School of Law]] in Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-john-anderson-dead-20171204-story.html|title=Illinois Republican John B.

==Political career==
[[File:John B. Anderson congress.jpg|thumb|upright|Anderson in 1965]]
Soon after his return, Anderson was approached about running for public office. In 1956, Anderson was elected [[State's attorney|State's Attorney]] in [[Winnebago County, Illinois]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Burnett|first=Sara|date=2017-12-04|title=Ex-Illinois Rep.

Allen]], announced his retirement. Anderson joined the Republican primary for Allen's 16th District seat—the real contest in this then-solidly Republican district—with four other contenders. He won first the primary (by 5,900 votes) in April and then the general election (by 45,000 votes) in November.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=10–14}} He served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for ten terms, from 1961 to 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Initially, Anderson was among the most conservative members of the Republican caucus. Three times (in 1961, 1963, and 1965) in his early terms as a Congressman, Anderson introduced a [[constitutional amendment]] to attempt to &quot;recognize the law and authority of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]&quot; over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=september-21-1980-debate-transcript | title=Debate Transcript | work=Commission on Presidential Debates | access-date=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bills died quietly, but later came back to haunt Anderson in his presidential candidacy.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=14–15, 234–35}}

As he continued to serve, the atmosphere of the [[History of the United States (1964–1980)|1960s]] weighed on Anderson and he began to re-think some of his beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; By the late 1960s, Anderson's positions on social issues shifted to the left, though his fiscal philosophy remained largely conservative.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1980&quot; /&gt; At the same time, he was held in high esteem by his colleagues in the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; In 1964, he won appointment to a seat on the powerful [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; In 1969, he became [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Chairman]] of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]], the number three position in the [[Leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican hierarchy]] in what was (at that time) the minority party.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=16–21}}

Anderson increasingly found himself at odds with conservatives in his home district and other members of the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; He was not always a faithful supporter of the Republican agenda, despite his high rank in the Republican caucus.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; He was very critical of the Vietnam War, and was a very controversial critic of [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Watergate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; In 1974, despite his criticism of Nixon, he was nearly swept out by the strong anti-Republican tide in that year's election. He was re-elected with 55 percent of the vote, what would be the lowest percentage of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; His spot as the chairman of the House Republican Committee was challenged three times after his election&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; and, when [[Gerald Ford]] was defeated in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 Presidential campaign]], Anderson lost a key ally in Washington.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=24–27}}

In 1970 and 1972, Anderson had a Democratic challenger in Rockford Professor John E. Devine. In both years, Anderson defeated Devine by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/devine.html|title=The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians: Devine|first=Lawrence|last=Kestenbaum|website=politicalgraveyard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1977, a fundamentalist television minister from Rockford, Don Lyon, announced that he would challenge Anderson in the Republican primary.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=30—35}} It was a contentious campaign, where Lyon, with his experience before the camera, proved to be a formidable candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;RMS&quot;&gt;Ira Teinowitz, &quot;Anderson–Lyon Race is Top Attraction&quot;, ''Rockford Morning Star'', February 26, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon raised a great deal of money, won backing from many conservatives in the community and party, and put quite a scare into the Anderson team.&lt;ref name=&quot;RMS&quot; /&gt; Though Anderson was a leader in the House and the campaign commanded national attention, Anderson won the primary by 16% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1980&quot; /&gt; Anderson was aided in this campaign by strong newspaper endorsements and crossover support from independents and Democrats.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=28–36}}

==1980 presidential campaign==
In 1978, Anderson formed a presidential campaign [[exploratory committee]],&lt;ref&gt;campaign Jon Moore, ed., The Campaign for President: 1980 in Retrospect (Cambridge, MA: Ballinger, 1981)5&lt;/ref&gt; finding little public or media interest. In late April 1979, Anderson made the decision to enter the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|Republican primary]], joining a field that included [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bob Dole]], [[John Connally]], [[Howard Baker]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and the [[perennial candidate]] [[Harold Stassen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/07/29/page/J12/article/from-back-in-the-pack-john-anderson-begins-to-move|title=From back in the pack John Anderson begins to move (July 29, 1979)|access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last weeks of 1979, Anderson introduced his signature campaign proposal, advocating that a 50-cent a gallon [[Fuel taxes in the United States|gas tax]] be enacted with a corresponding 50% reduction in [[Social Security (United States)#Taxation|social security taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;CBS Evening News, December 10, 1979; NBC Nightly News, December 13, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson built [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980|state campaigns]] in four targeted states—[[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Illinois]], and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; He won some political support among Republicans, picking up endorsements along the way that helped legitimize him in the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/john-b-anderson-fiery-third-party-candidate-in-1980-presidential-race-dies-at-95/2017/12/04/dd25dfda-d92a-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html|title=John B.

===Slogan and positions===

He often referred to his candidacy as &quot;a campaign of ideas.&quot; He supported tax credits for businesses' research-and-development budgets, which he believed would increase American productivity; he also supported increasing funding for research at universities. He supported conservation and environmental protection. He opposed Ronald Reagan's proposal to cut taxes broadly, which he feared would increase the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] and the [[inflation]] rate (which was very high at the time of the campaign).

He opposed the requirement for registration for the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]], which Jimmy Carter had reinstated. This made him appealing to many liberal college students who were dissatisfied with Carter.&lt;ref&gt;''A Campaign of Ideas: The 1980 Anderson/Lucey Platform (Contributions in American Studies)'' by Clifford W Brown Jr. (Author), Robert J.

On January 5, 1980, in the Republican candidates' debate in [[Des Moines, Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygGL9DGeSGM |title=Republican Debate, Iowa 1980 |publisher=YouTube |date=1980-01-05 |access-date=2019-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other candidates, Anderson said lowering taxes, increasing defense spending, and balancing the budget were an impossible combination.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; In a stirring summation,{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=120-127}} Anderson invoked his father's immigration to the United States and said that we would have to make sacrifices today for a better tomorrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; For the next week, Anderson's name and face were all over the national news programs, in newspapers, and in national news magazines.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=120-127}}

Anderson spent less than $2000 in Iowa, but he finished with 4.3% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; The television networks were covering the event, portraying Anderson to a national audience as a man of character and principle.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=133-156}} When the voters in New Hampshire went to the polls, Anderson again exceeded the expectations, finishing fourth with just under 10% of the vote.{{sfn|Mason|2011|pp=133-156}}

Anderson was declared the winner in both Massachusetts and Vermont by the Associated Press,&lt;ref&gt;CBS Evening News, western edition, March 4, 1980; MacPherson, &quot;Wow! Said John Anderson,&quot; March 6, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bisnow|1983|p=146}} but the following morning ended up losing both primaries by a slim margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; In Massachusetts, he lost to George Bush by 0.3% and in Vermont he lost to Reagan by 690 votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt;

Anderson arrived in Illinois following the New England primaries and had a lead in the state polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; but his Illinois campaign struggled despite endorsements from the state's two largest newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt; Reagan defeated him, 48% to 37%. Anderson carried Chicago and Rockford, the state's two largest cities at the time, but he lost in the more conservative [[Southern Illinois|southern section of the state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CTobit&quot; /&gt;

The next week, there was a primary in Connecticut, which (while Anderson was on the ballot) his team had chosen not to campaign actively in.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; He finished third in Connecticut with 22% of the vote, and it seemed to most like any other loss, whether Anderson said he was competing or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; Next was Wisconsin, and this was thought to be Anderson's best chance for victory, but he again finished third, winning 27% of the vote.{{sfn|Mason|2011|p=238}}

The Republican platform failed to endorse the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] or support extension of time for its ratification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25844 Republican Party Platform of 1980], July 15, 1980. ''The American Presidency Project''&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was a strong supporter of both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4president.org/brochures/andersonlucey1980brochure.htm John Anderson for President 1980 Campaign Brochure], www.4president.org&lt;/ref&gt; Pollsters were finding that Anderson was much more popular across the country with all voters than he was in the Republican primary states.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-anderson-former-illinois-congressman-presidential-candidate-dead-at-95/|title=John Anderson, former congressman and 1980 presidential candidate, dies at 95|work=[[CBS News]]|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without any campaigning, he was running at 22% nationally in a three-way race.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt; Anderson's personal aide and confidant, Tom Wartowski, encouraged him to remain in the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson faced a huge number of obstacles as a non-major party candidate: having to qualify for 51 ballots (which the major parties appeared on automatically), having to raise money to run a campaign (the major parties received close to $30 million in [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|government money for their campaigns]]), having to win national coverage, having to build a campaign overnight, and having to find a suitable running mate among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt; He built a new campaign team, qualified for every ballot, raised a great deal of money, and rose in the polls to as high as 26% in one [[Gallup poll]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 264–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the summer of 1980, he had an overseas campaign tour to show his foreign policy credentials and it took a drubbing on national television. The major parties, particularly the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republicans]], basked in the spotlight of their [[United States presidential nominating convention|national conventions]] where Anderson was left out of the coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt; Anderson made an appearance with [[Ted Kennedy]] and it, too, was a huge error.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; By the third week of August he was in the 13–15% range in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=With Kennedy Aid, Carter Cuts Reagan Lead in Poll |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 19, 1980 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/19/archives/with-kennedy-aid-carter-cuts-reagan-lead-in-poll-carter-gains-in.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical issue for Anderson was appearing in the fall [[1980 United States presidential debates|presidential debates]] after the League of Women Voters invited him to appear due to popular interest in his candidacy, although he was only polling 12% at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/18/open_up_the_debates_green_partys| title=Open Up the Debates: Green Party's Jill Stein Accuses Democrats &amp; GOP of Rigging Debate Rules| website=Democracy Now!| date=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August, he named [[Patrick Lucey]], the former two-term Democratic Governor of Wisconsin and Ambassador to Mexico as his running mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt; Late in August, Anderson released a 317-page comprehensive platform, under the banner of the National Unity Party,&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 352.&lt;/ref&gt; that was very well received. In early September, a court challenge to Federal Election Campaign Act was successful and Anderson qualified for post-election public funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/john-anderson-third-party-candidate-for-president-dies-at-95|title=John Anderson, Independent Who Ran for President, Dies at 95|website=Bloomberg|date=December 4, 2017|access-date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Anderson submitted his petitions for his fifty-first ballot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt; Then, the League ruled that the polls showed that he had met the qualification threshold and said he would appear in the debates.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 332-369.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall===
Carter said that he would not appear on stage with Anderson, and sat out the debate, which hurt the President in the eyes of voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt; Reagan and Anderson had a [[1980 United States presidential debates#First presidential debate (Convention Center)|debate]] in Baltimore on September 21, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiAf2Ch9QbM |title=1980 Presidential Candidate Debate: Governor Ronald Reagan and Congressman John Anderson – 9/21/80 |publisher=YouTube |date=1980-09-21 |access-date=2019-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson did well, and polls showed he won a modest debate victory over Reagan, but Reagan, who had been portrayed by Carter throughout the campaign as something of a warmonger, proved to be a reasonable candidate and carried himself well in the debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt; The debate was Anderson's big opportunity as he needed a break-out performance, but what he got was a modest victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot; /&gt; In the following weeks, Anderson slowly faded out of the picture with his support dropping from 16% to 10–12% in the first half of October.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1980&quot; /&gt; 

By the end of the month, [[1980 United States presidential debates#Second presidential debate (Public Music Hall)|Reagan debated Carter]] alone, but [[CNN]] attempted to let Anderson participate in the 2nd debate by tape delay. [[Daniel Schorr]] asked Anderson the questions from the Carter-Reagan debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEHGr4VuBYI |title=Carter/Reagan/Anderson Debate |publisher=YouTube |date=1980-10-28 |access-date=2019-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then CNN interspersed Anderson's live answers with tape delayed responses from Carter and Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1027/102722.html|title=Anderson to debate, too, via cable-TV network|date=October 27, 1980|access-date=January 5, 2019|journal=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3q0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263 |title=Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail - Alan Schroeder - Google Books |date=2016-06-28 |access-date=2019-01-05|isbn=9780231541503 |last1=Schroeder |first1=Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/10/29/archives/a-carter-flipflop-is-seen-by-anderson-responding-to-2-debaters.html |title=A CARTER 'FLIP-FLOP' IS SEEN BY ANDERSON; Responding to 2 Debaters' Views, He Says on Cable TV That Tax Cuts Are 'Irresponsible' Carter's Earlier Position Repeating Charges of Past Service in World War II - The New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=1980-10-29 |access-date=2019-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's support continued to fade down to 5%, although rose up to 8% just before election day.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1980&quot; /&gt; Although Reagan would win a sizable victory, the polls showed the two major party candidates closer (Gallup's final poll was 47–44–8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/9442/election-polls-accuracy-record-presidential-elections.aspx |title=Election Polls – Accuracy Record in Presidential Elections |website=Gallup |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216181548/http://www.gallup.com/poll/9442/election-polls-accuracy-record-presidential-elections.aspx |archive-date=February 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) going into the election and it was clear that many would-be Anderson supporters had been pulled away by Carter and Reagan.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPobit&quot; /&gt; In the end, Anderson finished with 6.6% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 366–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Anderson's support came from those [[Rockefeller Republican|Liberal Republicans]] who were suspicious of, or even hostile to, Reagan's conservative wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt; Many prominent intellectuals, including ''[[All in the Family]]'' creator [[Norman Lear]], and the editors of the liberal magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'', also endorsed the Anderson campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt; Cartoonist [[Garry Trudeau]]'s ''[[Doonesbury]]'' ran several strips sympathetic to the Anderson campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doonesbury @ 30&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://doonesbury.washingtonpost.com/strip/archive/timeline/1980 | title=Doonesbury's Timeline: 1980s | access-date=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], actor [[Paul Newman]] and historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] have also been reported as having supported Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/165276|title = The Last Serious, Qualified Third-Party Candidate for President Was … ?|date = March 5, 2017|website = [[History News Network]]|publisher = [[George Washington University]]|last = Feinman|first = Ronald L.|access-date = June 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Carter campaign feared Anderson could be a [[spoiler effect|spoiler]], Anderson's campaign turned out to be &quot;simply another option&quot; for frustrated voters who had already decided not to back Carter for another term. Polls found that around 37% of Anderson voters favored Reagan as their second choice over Carter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/04/04/third_party_myth_easterbrook/ |date=April 4, 2011 |title=The myths that just won't die |first=Steve |last=Kornacki |work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson did not carry a single precinct in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2011), 409, 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's finish was still the best showing for a third party candidate since [[George Wallace]]'s 14 percent in 1968 and stands as the seventh best for any such candidate since [[American Civil War|the Civil War]] (trailing [[James B. Weaver]]'s 8.5 percent in 1892, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s 27 percent in 1912, [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]]'s 17 percent in 1924, Wallace, and [[Ross Perot]]'s 19 percent and 8 percent in 1992 and 1996, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Dave and Benenson, Bob; ''Elections A to Z'', p. 632 {{ISBN|1506331505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt;

He pursued Ohio's refusal to provide ballot access to the U.S. Supreme Court and won 5–4 in ''[[Anderson v. Celebrezze]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; His inability to make headway against the ''de facto'' two-party system as an independent in that election would later lead him to become an advocate for [[instant-runoff voting]], helping to found [[FairVote]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot; /&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:John Anderson 1999.jpg|thumb|Anderson speaking in 1999]]
By the end of the campaign, much of Anderson's support came from college students.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt; He capitalized on that by becoming a visiting professor at a series of universities: [[Stanford University]], [[University of Southern California]], [[Duke University]], [[University of Illinois College of Law]], [[Brandeis University]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Oregon State University]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], and [[Nova Southeastern University]] and delivered the lecture at the 1988 [[Waldo Family Lecture Series on International Relations]] at [[Old Dominion University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waldo Family Lecture Series Digital Collection|url=http://dc.lib.odu.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/waldoseries|website=Old Dominion University|access-date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot; /&gt;

He was chair of [[FairVote]] from 1996 to 2008, after helping to found the organization in 1992, and continued to serve on its board until 2014. He also served as president of the [[Citizens for Global Solutions|World Federalist Association]] and on the advisory board of [[Public Campaign]] and the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], and was [[of counsel]] to the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Greenberg &amp; Lieberman]], LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplegal.com/ourattorneys.html |title= Washington DC Lawyer – Washington Attorney – Patent Lawyer |website=Aplegal.com |access-date=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first executive director of the [[Council for the National Interest]], founded in 1989 by former Congressmen [[Paul Findley]] (R-IL) and [[Pete McCloskey]] (R-CA) to promote American interests in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Ayoon |last= Wa Aza| url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242066683.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130518221949/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242066683.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= May 18, 2013 | title= How Pro-Israeli Lobbies Destroy U.S. Interests| edition=[[Al-Hayat|Dar Al Hayat, International]]| date= November 14, 2010| website=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Delinda C. | last= Hanely | url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1952602901.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130518215609/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1952602901.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= May 18, 2013 | title= CNI Cruises into a New Decade| work= [[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]| date=January 1, 2010| via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]], he was briefly considered as possible candidate for the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] nomination, but instead endorsed [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics1.com/greens.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317082438/http://www.politics1.com/greens.htm |archive-date=March 17, 2009 |title=Presidency 2000: Ralph Nader of Connecticut, Green Party Presidential Nominee |website=Politics1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, Anderson indicated strong support for the candidacy of a fellow Illinoisan, Democratic contender [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Campaign digest | work=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=January 7, 2008 | page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he played a role in the creation of the [[Justice Party (United States)|Justice Party]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]], [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] party organized to support the candidacy of former [[Salt Lake City]] mayor [[Rocky Anderson]] (no relation) for the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Rocky Anderson returns this time shooting for nation's top office&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

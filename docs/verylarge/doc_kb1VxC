Because of the stress of the long hours, he mails to a friend, &quot;B,&quot; back in London, asking if he could get him a job that allows more than five hours' sleep a night. His friend duly replies, offering a job taking care of a &quot;congenital imbecile,&quot; and sends him some money to get his possessions from the pawn. The narrator then quits his job as a ''plongeur'' and leaves for London.

===Chapters 24–38 (London)===
The narrator arrives in London expecting to have the job waiting for him. Unfortunately the would-be employers have gone abroad, &quot;patient and all.&quot;

Until his employers return, the narrator lives as a [[tramp]], sleeping in an assortment of venues: lodging houses, tramps' hostels or &quot;spikes,&quot; and [[Salvation Army]] shelters. Because vagrants can not &quot;enter any one spike, or any two London spikes, more than once in a month, on pain of being confined for a week,&quot; he is required to keep on the move, with the result that long hours are spent tramping or waiting for hostels to open. Chapters XXV to XXXV describe his various journeys, the different forms of accommodation, a selection of the people he meets, and the tramps' reaction to [[Charity (practice)|Christian charity]]: &quot;Evidently the tramps were not grateful for their free tea. And yet it was excellent [....] I am sure too that it was given in a good spirit, without any intention of humiliating us; so in fairness we ought to have been grateful—still, we were not.&quot; Characters in this section of the book include the Irish tramp called Paddy, &quot;a good fellow&quot; whose &quot;ignorance was limitless and appalling,&quot; and the [[Street painting|pavement artist]] Bozo, who has a good literary background and was formerly an amateur astronomer, but who has suffered a succession of misfortunes.

The final chapters provide a catalogue of various types of accommodation open to tramps. The narrator offers some general remarks, concluding,

&lt;blockquote&gt;At present I do not feel that I have seen more than the fringe of poverty. Still, I can point to one or two things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the [[Salvation Army]], nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Fact and fiction ==
One of the debates surrounding ''Down and Out'' is whether it was a piece of factual autobiography or part fiction. Orwell wrote in the Introduction to the 1935 French edition: &quot;I think I can say that I have exaggerated nothing except in so far as all writers exaggerate by selecting. I did not feel that I had to describe events in the exact order in which they happened, but everything I have described did take place at one time or another.&quot; In Chapter XXIV, it is &quot;clear that Orwell did distort facts by claiming on his return from Paris he found himself down and out in London and had not 'the slightest notion of how to get a cheap bed'. This of course heightens the tension [...] but the truth is that in Paris he had already written his first substantial essay, &quot;[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]&quot;, describing a night spent in a [[Notting Hill]] tramps' hostel. Before his departure from England he had voluntarily lived among tramps for some time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, Penguin Classics 2001 edition, pp. xiii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'', Orwell referred to the tramping experiences described in ''Down and Out'', writing that &quot;nearly all the incidents described there actually happened, though they have been re-arranged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell ''The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; Left Book Club 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measure of the work's veracity may be gleaned from a marked-up copy, containing sixteen annotations, which Orwell gave to Brenda Salkeld. Of the descent into poverty from Chapter III, he wrote, &quot;Succeeding chapters are not actually autobiography but drawn from what I have seen.&quot; Of Chapter VII, however, he wrote, &quot;This all happened;&quot; of Hotel X, &quot;All as exact as I could make it;&quot; and, of the Russian restaurant, &quot;All the following is an entirely accurate description of the restaurant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shelden ''Orwell: The Authorised Biography'' William Heinemann 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; On the personalities, Orwell's own introduction to the French edition states that the characters are individuals, but are &quot;intended more as representative types.&quot;

The luxury hotel in which Orwell worked in the autumn of 1929 was identified as the [[Hôtel de Crillon|Crillon]] by [[Sonia Orwell]], as recounted by [[Sam White (foreign correspondent)|Sam White]], the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'''s Paris correspondent in his column for 16 June 1967. The writers Stansky and Abrahams suggested, in their study of Orwell, that it was the Hotel Lotti.&lt;ref&gt;''A Kind of Compulsion 1903–36'' p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Within a month of publication, Humbert Possenti, &quot;a restaurateur and hotelier of forty years,&quot; had written to ''[[The Times]]'' complaining that the book was unfairly disparaging to the restaurant trade.&lt;ref&gt;Possenti, Humbert. &quot;Hotel Kitchens.&quot; ''The Times'', 31 January 1933: 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' had previously reviewed ''Down and Out in Paris and London'', describing it as &quot;a vivid picture of an apparently mad world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Google&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0FfsdUQc2OIC&amp;pg=PA60 Google Books] Scott Lucas, ''Orwell'' (2003) Haus Publishing,
{{ISBN|1904341330|978-1904341338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell responded to the restaurateur's criticism with a letter to the same newspaper: &quot;I do know that in our hotel there were places which no customer could possibly have been allowed to see with any hope of retaining his custom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. &quot;Hotel Kitchens.&quot; ''The Times'', 11 February 1933: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|Adelphi]]'', [[C. Day Lewis]] wrote, &quot;Orwell's book is a tour of the underworld, conducted without hysteria or prejudice [...] a model of clarity and good sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; [[JB Priestley]], in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', considered it &quot;uncommonly good reading. An excellent book and a valuable social document. The best book of its kind I have read in a long time.&quot;&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; [[Compton Mackenzie]] wrote of Orwell's &quot;immensely interesting book [...] a genuine human document, which at the same time is written with so much artistic force that, in spite of the squalor and degradation thus unfolded, the result is curiously beautiful with the beauty of an accomplished etching on copper. The account of a casual ward in this country horrifies like some scene of inexplicable misery in [[Dante]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Orwell, The Transformation'', Stansky and Abrahams, Paladin, 1984 edn., p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American publication, [[James T. Farrell]], writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', called it &quot;genuine, unexaggerated and intelligent,&quot; while Herbert Gorman wrote for the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', &quot;He possesses a keen eye for character and a rough-and-ready 'styleless style' that plunges along and makes the reader see what the author wants him to see.&quot; In contrast, the reviewer for ''[[New English Weekly]]'' wrote, &quot;This book [...] is forcefully written and is very readable, yet it fails to carry conviction. We wonder if the author was really down and out. Down certainly, but out?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in the Orwell Archive, quoted by Bernard Crick '' Orwell: A Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyril Connolly]] later wrote, &quot;I don't think ''Down and Out in London and Paris'' is more than agreeable journalism; it was all better done by his friend [[Henry Miller]]. Orwell found his true form a few years later.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Connolly ''The Evening Colonnade&amp;nbsp;– George Orwell I'' Harcourt Brace Jovanovich 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell agreed with this assessment.&lt;ref name=mishan&gt;{{cite web|last=Mishan|first=Ligaya|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/book-club/well-always-have-paris|title=We’ll Always Have Paris|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=20 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Miller's controversial work ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) is based on his own experiences in Paris around the time Orwell was there.

In an essay for the 1971 ''The World of George Orwell'', [[Richard Mayne (administrator)|Richard Mayne]] considered the book as typical of something that was true of a great deal of Orwell's later writing: his &quot;relish at revealing behind-the-scenes squalor. He was always taking the lid off things—poverty, parlour Socialism, life in a coal mine, prep-school tyranny, the Empire, the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[propaganda|political misuse]] of [[language]]. He might well have echoed [[W.H. Auden]]: ''All I have is a voice/To undo the folded lie.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mayne, ''The World of George Orwell'', p. 45 Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrator's comments on Jews in the book are cited by a journalist for ''[[Haaretz]]'' when considering what he terms &quot;Orwell’s latent anti-Semitism&quot;.&lt;ref name=haarz&gt;Pfeffer, Anshel (2012). &quot;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/was-orwell-an-anti-semite-1.455763 Was Orwell an anti-Semite?]&quot; ''Haaretz Group''. Retrieved 2014-07-05&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest the work may have been Orwell's [[parody]] of his own social upbringing and social class, noticing the narrator has both racist and anti-racist outbursts.&lt;ref name=Mendes&gt;{{Cite book|last=Philip|first=Mendes|year=2014|title=Jews and the Left: The Rise and Fall of a Political Alliance|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=62|isbn=9781-137008305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Isl&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shindler|first=Colin|year=2011|title=Israel and the European Left: Between Solidarity and Delegitimization (Google eBook)|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=91|isbn=978-1137008305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator cites the book as evidence that anti-Semitism was much more prevalent in Paris than in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aberbach|first=David|date=1972|title=The European Jews, Patriotism and the Liberal State, 1789–1939: A Study of Literature and Social Psychology|publisher=Routledge|page=32|isbn=978-0415540131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{terrorism}}
A '''letter bomb''', also called '''parcel bomb''', '''mail bomb''', '''package bomb''', '''note bomb''', '''message bomb''', '''gift bomb''', '''present bomb''', '''delivery bomb''', '''surprise bomb''', '''postal bomb''', or '''post bomb''', is an [[explosive device]] sent via the [[mail|postal service]], and designed with the intention to injure or kill the recipient when opened. They have been used in [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks such as those of the [[Theodore Kaczynski|Unabomber]]. Some countries have agencies whose duties include the interdiction of letter bombs and the investigation of letter bombings.&lt;ref&gt;*[[United States Postal Inspection Service|(USPIS)]] In the United States, the Postal Inspection Service is responsible for investigating the use, or threat of use, of letter bombs, harmful chemicals and dangerous devices sent through the postal system.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter bomb may have been in use for nearly as long as the common postal service has been in existence, as far back as 1764 (''see [[#Examples|Examples]]'').

==Description==
Letter bombs are usually designed to explode immediately on opening, with the intention of seriously injuring or killing the recipient (who may or may not be the person to whom the bomb was addressed). A related threat is mail containing unidentified powders or chemicals, as in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].

==Patentability==
Letter-bombs, along with [[anti-personnel mine]]s, are typical examples of [[patentable subject matter|subject-matter excluded from patentability]] under the [[European Patent Convention]], because the publication or exploitation of such [[invention]]s are contrary to the &quot;''[[ordre public]]''&quot; &lt;!-- yes ordre, not order! see the wording of Art. 53(a) EPC --&gt;and/or [[morality]] ({{EPC Article|53|a}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Guidelines|g|ii|4|1}}, &quot;Matter contrary to &quot;''ordre public''&quot; or morality&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* What might be the first recorded case of a device broadly similar to a modern parcel bomb featured in the 18th century affair known as the [[Bandbox Plot]]. On November 4, 1712 a bandbox (i.e. a lightweight hat-box) was sent to [[Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford]], the British [[Lord Treasurer]]. It contained a number of loaded and cocked [[pistols]], to whose triggers was attached a thread which would have made the pistols fire the moment the box was opened. The plot was foiled by the [[perspicacity]] of [[Jonathan Swift]] (author of “Gulliver’s Travels”), who happened to be visiting the Earl of Oxford. Swift, perceiving the thread, seized the package and cut the thread, thus disarming the device. The attack was laid at the door of the opposition [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party and threw enormous popular sympathy behind Harley. The precise perpetrators were never identified or apprehended. 
* One of the world's first mail bombs is mentioned in the 18th century diary of [[Danish people|Danish]] official and historian [[Bolle Willum Luxdorph]]. His diary mainly consists of concise references to news from [[Denmark]] and abroad. In the entry for January 19, 1764 he writes the following: ''Colonel Poulsen residing at [[Børglum Abbey]] was sent by mail a box. When he opens it, therein is to be found gunpowder and a firelock which sets fire unto it, so he became very injured.'' The entry for February 15 same year says: ''Colonel Poulsen receives a letter in German, [saying] that soon the dose will be increased.'' It is referring to the dose of gunpowder in the box. The perpetrator was never found.&lt;ref&gt;Eiler Nystrøm(ed.) - ''Luxdorphs Dagbøger'', volume I, p. 207 &amp; 209, Copenhagen, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In a later reference Luxdorph has found a mention of a similar bomb being used, also in 1764, but in [[Savona]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luxdorphs Dagbøger'', volume I, p. 293. The reference Luxdorph mentions is this: ''Theatrum Europæum'', tome XI, p. 745 column 2, fin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punched tape''' or '''perforated paper tape''' is a form of [[data storage device|data storage]] that consists of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched. It developed from and was subsequently used alongside [[punched card]]s, differing in that the tape is continuous.

It was used throughout the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries for programmable looms, [[teleprinter]] communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for [[minicomputer]]s and [[CNC machine tool]]s.

== History ==
[[file:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|thumb|upright|A paper tape, constructed from [[punched card]]s, in use in a [[Jacquard loom]]. The large holes on each edge are [[sprocket]] holes, used to pull the paper tape through the loom.]]

Paper tapes constructed from punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling looms. Perforated paper tapes were first used by [[Basile Bouchon]] in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for [[Jacquard loom]]s. The resulting paper tape, also called a &quot;chain of cards&quot;, was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair.

This led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one &quot;continuous card&quot; (or tape). Many professional [[embroidery]] operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as &quot;punchers&quot; even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s. In 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a [[Player piano|piano playing device]] that read data from [[Piano roll|perforated paper rolls]].

In 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] used punched tape to send [[telegram]]s. This technology was adopted by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1857 for the [[Wheatstone system|preparation, storage and transmission of data]] in telegraphy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxfield&quot;/&gt;

In 1880s, [[Tolbert Lanston]] invented the [[Monotype System]], which consisted of a keyboard (typesetting machine) and a composition [[Casting (metalworking)|caster]]. The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in 0, 1, or more of 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.

=== Current use ===

In the 21st century, use of punched tape is very rare. It may still be used in older military systems and by some hobbyists.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining applications, very few people still use tape. However, some modern CNC systems still measure the size of stored CNC programs in feet or meters, corresponding to the equivalent length if punched on paper tape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smid&quot;/&gt;

[[file:Papertape2.jpg|thumb|left|Fanfold paper tape]]

Data was represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical programmable calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or [[Harvard Mark I]], used paper tape with 24 rows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalakov&quot;/&gt; A row of smaller sprocket holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a [[sprocket|sprocket wheel]]. Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the [[least significant bit]]s, when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Dimensions ===

Tape for punching was 0.00394 inches (0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. The two most common widths were 11/16 inch (17.46&amp;nbsp;mm) for five bit codes, and 1 inch (25.4&amp;nbsp;mm) for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was 0.1 inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;mm) in both directions. Data holes were 0.072 inches (1.83&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter; feed holes were 0.046 inches (1.17&amp;nbsp;mm).

=== Chadless tape ===
[[file:1980-Paper Tape fromTeletype (chadless, 5-level Baudot)-02.jpg|thumb|left|Chadless 5-level Baudot paper tape circa ~1975–1980 punched at Teletype Corp]]

Most tape-punching equipment used solid punches to create holes in the tape. This process created &quot;[[chad (paper)|chad]]&quot;, or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment.

A variation on the tape punch was a device called a ''Chadless Printing Reperforator''. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no [[chad (paper)|chad]] would be produced; the &quot;hole&quot; was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no &quot;chad box&quot; to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape, once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later high-speed readers. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.

== Encoding ==
[[file:Papertape-Wikipedia-example-dark1.svg|thumb|upright|The word &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, and a [[Newline|CR/LF]] as 7-bit ASCII, without a parity bit, [[least significant bit]] on the right—e.g. &quot;W&quot; is 1010111]]

Text was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard [[character encoding]] was [[Baudot code|Baudot]], which dates back to the 19th century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the [[Baudot code#Murray code|Murray code]] (which added [[carriage return]] and [[line feed]]), [[Western Union code]], [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA 2), and [[American Teletypewriter code]] (USTTY), were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proesch&quot;/&gt; Other standards, such as [[Teletypesetter]] (TTS), [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], had six holes. In the early 1960s, the [[American Standards Association]] led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as [[ASCII]]. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] ([[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]). Others, such as [[teleprinter|Telex]], stayed with the earlier codes.

== Applications ==

=== Communications ===
[[file:Telex machine ASR-32.jpg|thumb|right|[[Teletype Model 33|Telex model 32 teletype]] with paper tape punch and reader on the left]]
[[file:Honolulu IFSS Teletype1964.faa.jpg|thumb|right|Paper tape relay operation at US [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s Honolulu flight service station in 1964]]

Punched tape was used as a way of storing messages for [[Teleprinter|teletypewriters]]. Operators typed in the message to the paper tape, and then sent the message at the maximum line speed from the tape. This permitted the operator to prepare the message &quot;off-line&quot; at the operator's best typing speed, and permitted the operator to correct any error prior to transmission. An experienced operator could prepare a message at 135 words per minute (WPM) or more for short periods.

The line typically operated at 75WPM, but it operated continuously. By preparing the tape &quot;off-line&quot; and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous &quot;on-line&quot; typing by a single operator. Typically, a single 75WPM line supported three or more teletype operators working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end could be used to relay messages to another station. Large [[store and forward]] networks were developed using these techniques.

Paper tape could be read into computers at up to 1,000 characters per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hult&quot;/&gt; In 1963, a Danish company called [[Regnecentralen]] introduced a paper tape reader called RC 2000 that could read 2,000 characters per second; later they increased the speed further, up to 2,500 cps. As early as [[World War II]], the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)#Tape reading|Heath Robinson tape reader]], used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2,000&amp;nbsp;cps while [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] could run at 5,000 cps using an optical tape reader designed by Arnold Lynch.

=== Minicomputers ===
[[file:Harvard Mark I program tape.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|A 24-channel program tape for the [[Harvard Mark I]]]]

When the first [[minicomputer]]s were being released, most manufacturers turned to the existing mass-produced [[ASCII]] [[teleprinter]]s (primarily the [[Teletype Model 33]], capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and printer output. The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for &quot;Automatic Send/Receive&quot; as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR – [[Keyboard Send Receive|Keyboard Send/Receive]] and RO – Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.

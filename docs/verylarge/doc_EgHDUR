Relations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=338}} Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=136}} When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=391}} Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]], describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as &quot;batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=392}}

The Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=137}} When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=394}} Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader [[Peng Zhen]] mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=470–71}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-49000-0329, Berlin, Chruschtschow trägt sich ins Goldene Buch ein.jpg|thumb|220px|Nikita Khrushchev with [[Anastas Mikoyan]] (far right) in Berlin]]

Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and nominal head of state [[Leonid Brezhnev]] began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to [[Scandinavia]] in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=617}}

The conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier [[Alexander Shelepin]], and KGB chairman [[Vladimir Semichastny]], struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at [[Pitsunda]], [[Abkhaz ASSR]] with his close ally [[Anastas Mikoyan]]. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=5}} Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=6}} he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General [[Aleksi Inauri]], but otherwise taking no precautions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=11–13}}
[[File:1964-10-15 Khrushchev Resigns.ogv|thumb|left|[[Universal Newsreel]] about Khrushchev's resignation]]
Khrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of [[Vnukovo Airport]]; KGB chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB security guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/478480 &quot;Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny, spy chief, died on January 12th, aged 77&quot;]. ''The Economist'' (18 January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:

{{quote|I didn't even close the Kremlin to visitors. People were strolling around outside, while in the room the Presidium was meeting. I deployed my men around the Kremlin. Everything that was necessary was done. Brezhnev and Shelepin were nervous. I told them: Let's not do anything that isn't necessary. Let's not create the appearance of a coup.&lt;ref&gt;Mccauley, Martin (1995) ''The Khrushchev Era 1953–1964''. Longman. p. 81. {{ISBN|9780582277762}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called his friend and Presidium colleague [[Anastas Mikoyan]], and told him:

{{quote|I'm old and tired. Let them cope by themselves. I've done the main thing. Could anyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore and suggesting he retire? Not even a wet spot would have remained where we had been standing. Now everything is different. The fear is gone, and we can talk as equals. That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p = 13}}}}

On 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee each voted to accept Khrushchev's &quot;voluntary&quot; request to retire from his offices for reasons of &quot;advanced age and ill health.&quot; Brezhnev was elected First Secretary (later General Secretary), while [[Alexei Kosygin]] succeeded Khrushchev as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p = 16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316972/Nikita-Sergeyevich-Khrushchev|title=Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in retirement==
Khrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was assured that his house and ''[[dacha]]'' were his for life.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=16–17}} Following his removal from power, he fell into deep depression.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=622}} He received few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=622–23}} In the autumn of 1965, he and his wife were ordered to leave their house and ''dacha'' to move to an apartment and to a smaller ''dacha'' in [[Petrovo-Dalneye]]. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=278}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=623}} The depression continued, and his doctor prescribed sleeping pills and tranquillizers. One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, &quot;Grandfather cries.&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=623–24}} Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}

As the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favourably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, then in his &quot;wilderness years&quot; before his election to the presidency, who went to Khrushchev's Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his ''dacha''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=279}}

Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev began his memoirs. He dictated them into a tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every word would be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes, which he refused to do.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=280}}
While Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44919697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''Chruschtschows letzter Kampfd'']&lt;/ref&gt; Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title ''Khrushchev Remembers''. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=280–81}} Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, ''[[Izvestia]]'' denounced them as a fraud.{{sfn|Shabad|1970}} Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} In the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', Khrushchev was given a short characterization: &quot;In his activities, there were elements of [[subjectivism]] and [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]]&quot;.

In his final days, Khrushchev visited his son-in-law and former aide [[Alexei Adzhubei]] (1924–1993&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alexei-adzhubei-1499406.html ''Obituary: Alexei Adzhubei'']&lt;/ref&gt;) and told him, &quot;Never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the Central Committee. We will yet be remembered!&quot;{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=281}}

==Death==
Khrushchev died of a heart attack in a hospital near his home in Moscow on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a [[state funeral]] with interment in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|Kremlin Wall]] and was instead buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=282–83}}

''Pravda'' ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=299}} Veteran ''New York Times'' Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, &quot;Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.&quot;{{sfn|Schwartz|1971}}

==Legacy==
[[File:DestroyKhrusch.JPG|thumb|alt=The remains of a low rise building are seen between two high rises|A ''[[khrushchyovka]]'' is destroyed, Moscow, January 2008]]

Many of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180–82}}

Historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits. According to him, Khrushchev was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Robert (1997) ''A History of Twentieth-Century Russia''. Harvard UP. p. 375. {{ISBN|9780713991482}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were also easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even ''kolkhozes'' which had been successful with it in Ukraine and other southern portions of the USSR refused to plant it.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=128}} [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180–82}} While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=185}} Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180–82}} Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. The KGB and Red Army were given increasing powers. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the &quot;[[Prague Spring]]&quot; of 1968.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=184}}

[[File:The transfer of Crimea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet &quot;On the transfer of the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Oblast]]&quot;. Khrushchev transferred Crimea from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].]]

Though Khrushchev's strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=544}}

The Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians in the 21st century evaluate positively are those under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], and under Khrushchev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} A poll in 1998 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good—except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=283–84}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text is a mix of prose and [[anustubh]]-meter poetry verses. The text acknowledges the Hindu concept of [[Purusharthas]], and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. Its chapters discuss methods for courtship, training in the arts to be socially engaging, finding a partner, flirting, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xi-xiii}} The majority of the book is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou, ''The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text'', {{ISBN|978-0892815258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Levy (2010), Kama sense marketing, iUniverse, {{ISBN|978-1440195563}}, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is one of many Indian texts on ''[[Kama Shastra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages. The ''Kamasutra'' has influenced many secondary texts that followed after the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old [[Hindu temples]]. Of these, the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] is a UNESCO world heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240 Khajuraho Group of Monuments] UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the surviving temples in north India, one in [[Rajasthan]] sculpts all the major chapters and sexual positions to illustrate the ''Kamasutra''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/d/019pho0001007s3u00660000.html Ramgarh temple], The British Library&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wendy Doniger]], the ''Kamasutra'' became &quot;one of the most pirated books in English language&quot; soon after it was published in 1883 by [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]]. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the ''Kamasutra'' because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doniger2016p9&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Redeeming the Kamasutra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrVjDQAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-049928-0|pages=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date, author and history ==
[[File:Kama sutra, Vatsyayayan, commentary, sample ii, Sanskrit, Devanagari.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A ''Kamasutra'' manuscript page preserved in the vaults of the Raghunatha Hindu temple in Jammu &amp; Kashmir.]]
The original composition date or century for the ''Kamasutra'' is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Refractions of Desire, Feminist Perspectives in the Novels of Toni Morrison, Michèle Roberts, and Anita Desai|author=Sengupta, J.|date=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126906291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9Y_tQfm_WgC|page=21|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Keay]], the ''Kama Sutra'' is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India: A History: from the Earliest Civilisations to the Boom of the Twenty-first Century|pages=81–103|author=John Keay|publisher=Grove Press|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUPZt-4yqzQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger who has co-translated ''Kama sutra'' and published many papers on related Hindu texts, the surviving version of the ''Kamasutra'' must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}} The text makes no mention of the [[Gupta Empire]] which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping ancient Indian arts, Hindu culture and economy from the 4th-century through the 6th-century. For these reasons, she dates the ''Kama sutra'' to the second half of the 3rd-century CE.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii with footnote 2}}

The place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north or northwest ancient India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now [[Patna]]).{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}}

Vatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] verse, but little is known about him.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xi-xii}} Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} He cites the work of others he calls &quot;teachers&quot; and &quot;scholars&quot;, and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|p=xii}} Vatsyayana's Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the ''Brihatsamhita'' of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.{{sfn|Daniélou|1993|pp=3-4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Varahamihira|author2=M Ramakrishna Bhat|title=Brhat Samhita of Varahamihira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VR8iriWmzUC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1060-0|pages=720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The ''Kamasutra'' belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the ''Ratirahasya'' (called ''Kokashastra'' in some Indian scripts), the ''Anangaranga'', the ''Nagarasarvasva'', the ''Kandarpachudmani'', and the ''Panchasayaka''.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar|2002|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite journal|title= Rethinking the History of the &quot;Kāma&quot; World in Early India| author= Daud Ali| journal= Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1|year= 2011| pages= 1–13| jstor=23884104| doi=10.1007/s10781-010-9115-7| doi-access= free}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite journal| title= Padmaśrī's &quot;Nāgarasarvasva&quot; and the World of Medieval Kāmaśāstra|author= Daud Ali| journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39| number= 1| year= 2011| pages= 41–62| jstor= 23884106| doi=10.1007/s10781-010-9116-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desmond2011p15&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Pleasure is Mine: The Changing Subject of Erotic Science|author=Laura Desmond| journal= Journal of Indian Philosophy| volume= 39|number= 1| year= 2011| pages= 15–39|publisher= Springer| jstor= 23884105| doi=10.1007/s10781-010-9117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining object of the Indian Kamasastra literature, according to Laura Desmond – an anthropologist and a professor of Religious Studies, is the &quot;harmonious sensory experience&quot; from a good relationship between &quot;the self and the world&quot;, by discovering and enhancing sensory capabilities to &quot;affect and be affected by the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=desmond2011p15/&gt; Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha.

===Vedic heritage===
The earliest foundations of the ''kamasutra'' are found in the [[Vedic era]] literature of Hinduism.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;De1969p89&quot;/&gt; Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Svetaketu Uddalaka as the &quot;first human author of the ''kamasutra''&quot;. Uddalaka is an early Upanishadic [[rishi]] (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' such as in section 6.2, and the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10.{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}} These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (self, soul) and the ontological concept of [[Brahman]], these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious ''[[yajna]]'' ritual (sacrificial fire, [[Agni]]) and suffused in spiritual terms:{{sfn|Wendy Doniger|Sudhir Kakar |2002 |pp=xiv with footnote 8}}

&lt;poem&gt;
A fire – that is what a woman is, Gautama.
Her firewood is the vulva,
her smoke is the pubic hair,
her flame is the vagina,
when one penetrates her, that is her embers,
and her sparks are the climax.
In that very fire the gods offer semen,
and from that offering springs a man.

According to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the ''kamasutra'' began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a ''sutra''-genre text by Vatsyayana.&lt;ref name=&quot;De1969p89&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sushil Kumar De|title=Ancient Indian Erotics and Erotic Literature|url= https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.71326|year= 1969|publisher= K.L.

Governmental institutions in China conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years, but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus, reflecting its own particular interests. The Ming administration utilized [[Grand Secretaries]] to assist the emperor, handling paperwork under the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]] and later appointed as top officials of agencies and Grand Preceptor, a top-ranking, non-functional civil service post, under the [[Hongxi Emperor]] (r. 1424–25).{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=29–30}} The Grand Secretariat drew its members from the [[Hanlin Academy]] and were considered part of the imperial authority, not the ministerial one (hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times).{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=30}} The Secretariat operated as a coordinating agency, whereas the Six Ministries{{snd}}[[Ministry of Personnel|Personnel]], [[Ministry of Revenue (imperial China)|Revenue]], [[Ministry of Rites|Rites]], [[Ministry of War (imperial China)|War]], [[Ministry of Justice (imperial China)|Justice]], and [[Ministry of Public Works (imperial China)|Public Works]]{{snd}}were direct administrative organs of the state:{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=31–32}}
# The [[Ministry of Personnel]] was in charge of appointments, merit ratings, promotions, and demotions of officials, as well as granting of honorific titles.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=32}}
# The [[Ministry of Revenue (imperial China)|Ministry of Revenue]] was in charge of gathering census data, collecting taxes, and handling state revenues, while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=33}}
# The [[Ministry of Rites]] was in charge of state ceremonies, rituals, and sacrifices; it also oversaw registers for Buddhist and Daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=33–35}}
# The [[Ministry of War (imperial China)|Ministry of War]] was in charge of the appointments, promotions, and demotions of military officers, the maintenance of military installations, equipment, and weapons, as well as the courier system.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=35}}
# The [[Ministry of Justice (imperial China)|Ministry of Justice]] was in charge of judicial and penal processes, but had no supervisory role over the Censorate or the Grand Court of Revision.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=36}}
# The [[Ministry of Public Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Public Works]] had charge of government construction projects, hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service, manufacturing government equipment, the maintenance of roads and canals, standardization of weights and measures, and the gathering of resources from the countryside.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=36}}

====Bureaus and offices for the imperial household====
[[File:Ming coinage 14th 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese coinage in the Ming dynasty|Ming coinage]], 14–17th century]]
The imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=24}} Female servants were organized into the Bureau of Palace Attendance, Bureau of Ceremonies, Bureau of Apparel, Bureau of Foodstuffs, Bureau of the Bedchamber, Bureau of Handicrafts, and Office of Staff Surveillance.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=24}} Starting in the 1420s, eunuchs began taking over these ladies' positions until only the Bureau of Apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=24}} Hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the Directorate of Palace Attendants, but as eunuch power at court increased, so did their administrative offices, with eventual twelve directorates, four offices, and eight bureaus.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=24}} The dynasty had a vast imperial household, staffed with thousands of eunuchs, who were headed by the Directorate of Palace Attendants. The eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance, ceremonial rites, food, utensils, documents, stables, seals, apparel, and so on.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=25}} The offices were in charge of providing fuel, music, paper, and baths.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=25}} The bureaus were in charge of weapons, silverwork, laundering, headgear, bronze work, textile manufacture, wineries, and gardens.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=25}} At times, the most influential eunuch in the Directorate of Ceremonial acted as a ''de facto'' dictator over the state.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=11, 25}}

Although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies, there was a civil service office called the Seal Office, which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals, tallies, and stamps.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=25–26}} There were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=26}}

===Personnel===

====Scholar-officials====
[[File:Ming-Beamtenprüfungen1.jpg|thumb|upright|Candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted; detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk, by [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552).{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=200}}]]
The Hongwu emperor from 1373 to 1384 staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only. After that the scholar-officials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous [[Imperial examinations|examination system]] that was initially established by the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618).{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=12}}{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=96}}{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=145–146}} Theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials (although it was frowned upon for merchants to join); in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class. However, the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials. This was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions, where education was the most advanced. The expansion of the [[Technology of the Song dynasty#Movable type printing|printing industry since Song times]] enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces.  For young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary; for adult examination candidates there were mass-produced, inexpensive volumes of Confucian classics and successful examination answers.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=198–202}}

As in earlier periods, the focus of the examination was classical Confucian texts, while the bulk of test material centered on the [[Four Books]] outlined by [[Zhu Xi]] in the 12th century. {{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=198}} Ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the 1487 requirement of completing the &quot;[[eight-legged essay]]&quot;, a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends. The exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level, and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants. Officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades, each grade divided into two degrees, with ranging salaries (nominally paid in piculs of rice) according to their rank. While provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to low-ranking posts like the county graduates, those who passed the palace examination were awarded a ''jinshi'' ('presented scholar') degree and assured a high-level position.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=xxv}} In 276 years of Ming rule and ninety palace examinations, the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was 24,874.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=11–14}} Ebrey states that &quot;there were only two to four thousand of these ''jinshi'' at any given time, on the order of one out of 10,000 adult males.&quot; This was in comparison to the 100,000 ''shengyuan'' ('government students'), the lowest tier of graduates, by the 16th century.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=199}}

The maximum tenure in office was nine years, but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials.  If they were graded as superior then they were promoted, if graded adequate then they retained their ranks, and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank. In extreme cases, officials would be dismissed or punished. Only capital officials of grade 4 and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation, although they were expected to confess any of their faults. There were over 4,000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years. The Chief Instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a second-grade county graduate. The Supervisorate of Imperial Instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne; this office was headed by a Grand Supervisor of Instruction, who was ranked as first class of grade three.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=15–17, 26}}

Historians debate whether the examination system expanded or contracted upward social mobility. On the one hand, the exams were graded without regard to a candidate's social background, and were theoretically open to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;For the argument that they increased social mobility see [[Ping-ti Ho]], ''The Ladder of Success in Imperial China: Aspects of Social Mobility, 1368–1911'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; In actual practice, the successful candidates had years of a very expensive, sophisticated tutoring of the sort that wealthy gentry families specialized in providing their talented sons. In practice, 90 percent of the population was ineligible due to lack of education, but the upper 10 percent had equal chances for moving to the top. To be successful young men had to have extensive, expensive training in classical Chinese, the use of Mandarin in spoken conversation, calligraphy, and had to master the intricate poetic requirements of the eight-legged essay. Not only did the traditional gentry dominated the system, they also learned that conservatism and resistance to new ideas was the path to success.  For centuries critics had pointed out these problems, but the examination system only became more abstract and less relevant to the needs of China.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Elman, &quot;Political, social, and cultural reproduction via civil service examinations in late imperial China.&quot; ''Journal of Asian Studies'' 50.1 (1991): 7–28. [https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil_Service_Examinations.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The consensus of scholars is that the eight-legged essay can be blamed as a major cause of &quot;China's cultural stagnation and economic backwardness.&quot; However Benjamin Ellman argues there were some positive features, since the essay form was capable of fostering “abstract thinking, persuasiveness, and prosodic form”  and that its elaborate structure discouraged a wandering, unfocused narrative”.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin A. Elman. ''A Cultural History of Civil Examinations in Late Imperial China'' (2000) quoting pp 380, 394, 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lesser functionaries====

Scholar-officials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=18}} The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=18–19}}

====Eunuchs, princes, and generals====
[[File:Detail of The Emperor's Approach, Xuande period.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of ''The Emperor's Approach'' showing the [[Wanli Emperor]]'s royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry ([[:File:Departure Herald-Ming Dynasty.jpg|full panoramic painting here]])]]
Eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the Ming dynasty. One of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the Eastern Depot at the beginning of the dynasty, later the Western Depot. This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial, hence this state organ's often totalitarian affiliation.  Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks, only theirs had four grades instead of nine.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=24–25}}&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Mote, ''Imperial China: 900–1800'' (1999) pp 602–606&lt;/ref&gt;

Descendants of the first Ming emperor were made princes and given (typically nominal) military commands, annual stipends, and large estates. The title used was &quot;king&quot; ({{lang|zh|王}}, ''wáng'') but – unlike the princes in the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] dynasties – these estates were not [[feudatories]], the princes did not serve any administrative function, and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=8}} The [[Jingnan Campaign|rebellion of the Prince of Yan]] was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes, but once the [[Yongle Emperor]] was enthroned, he continued his nephew's policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border. Although princes served no organ of state administration, the princes, consorts of the imperial princesses, and ennobled relatives did staff the [[Imperial Clan Court]], which supervised the imperial genealogy.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=26}}

Like scholar-officials, military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years (as opposed to three years for officials).{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|p=19}} However, military officers had less prestige than officials. This was due to their hereditary service (instead of solely merit-based) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence (wu) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge (wen).{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|pp=109–112}} Although seen as less prestigious, military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations, and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills.{{sfnp|Hucker|1958|pp=19–20}} In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period, the Ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector. In the early half of the dynasty, men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office; this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.{{sfnp|Robinson|1999|pp=116–117}}

[[Chinese literature|Literature]], [[Chinese painting|painting]], [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Music of China|music]], and [[Chinese opera]] of various types flourished during the Ming dynasty, especially in the economically prosperous lower Yangzi valley. Although short fiction had been popular as far back as the Tang dynasty (618–907),{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104–105}} and the works of contemporaneous authors such as Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic, the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel. While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of [[Classical Chinese]], those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families, merchants, and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed [[Vernacular Chinese]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|pp=202–203}} Literati scholars edited or developed [[Four Great Classical Novels|major Chinese novels]] into mature form in this period, such as ''[[Water Margin]]'' and ''[[Journey to the West]]''. ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', published in 1610, although incorporating earlier material, marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew H. Plaks]], ''Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel''. (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-691-06708-2}}). Plaks counts ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Water Margin'' (or, ''Men of the Marshes''),  ''Journey to the West'', and ''Golden Lotus''  (or ''Plum in a Golden Vase'').&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of the dynasty, [[Feng Menglong]] and [[Ling Mengchu]] innovated with vernacular short fiction. Theater scripts were equally imaginative. The most famous, ''[[The Peony Pavilion]]'', was written by [[Tang Xianzu]] (1550–1616), with its first performance at the [[Pavilion of Prince Teng]] in 1598.

Informal essay and travel writing was another highlight. [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641), a [[travel literature]] author, published his ''Travel Diaries'' in 404,000 written [[Chinese characters|characters]], with information on everything from local [[History of geography|geography]] to [[mineralogy]].{{sfnp|Needham|1959|p=524}}{{sfnp|Hargett|1985|p=69}} The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582; by 1638 the Beijing [[Gazette]] switched from using [[woodblock printing|woodblock print]] to [[movable type]] printing.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=xxi}} The new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late Ming period, for the readership of the merchant class.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=215–217}}

[[File:Mingdynasty.jpg|thumb|left|Poetry of Min Ding, 17th century]]
In contrast to Xu Xiake, who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature, the Chinese poet and official [[Yuan Hongdao]] (1568–1610) used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|pp=318–319}} Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholar-official. This anti-official sentiment in Yuan's travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the Song dynasty poet and official [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101).{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=319}} Yuan Hongdao and his two brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and [[Yuan Zhongdao]] (1570–1623), were the founders of the Gong'an School of letters.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=318}} This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism, which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the ''Jin Ping Mei''.{{sfnp|Chang|2007|p=318}} Yet even gentry and scholar-officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature, seeking courtesans as soulmates to re-enact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=229–231}}

Famous painters included [[Ni Zan]] and [[Dong Qichang]], as well as the [[Four Masters of the Ming dynasty]], [[Shen Zhou]], [[Tang Yin]], [[Wen Zhengming]], and [[Qiu Ying]]. They drew upon the techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8&amp;nbsp;kg (100&amp;nbsp;oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=201}}

[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.]]

The period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelains. The major production center for porcelain was the [[Jingdezhen porcelain#Ming|imperial kilns at Jingdezhen]] in [[Jiangxi]] province, most famous in the period for [[Blue and white pottery|blue and white porcelain]], but also producing other styles. The [[Dehua porcelain factories]] in [[Fujian]] catered to European tastes by creating [[Chinese export porcelain]] by the late 16th century. Individual potters also became known, such as [[He Chaozong]], who became famous in the early 17th century for his style of [[Blanc-de-Chine|white porcelain]] sculpture. In ''The Ceramic Trade in Asia'', Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=206}}

[[Carved lacquer|Carved designs in lacquerware]] and designs glazed onto [[porcelain]] wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting. These items could be found in the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in [[Chinese jade|jade]], ivory, and [[cloisonné]]. The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery [[latticework]]. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=10}}

Connoisseurship in the late Ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=10}} The Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=224–225}} However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; [[Liu Tong]] (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=225}} He revealed that a [[Xuande|Xuande era]] (1426–1435) bronze work could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=225–226}}

The dominant religious beliefs during the Ming dynasty were the various forms of [[Chinese folk religion]] and the [[Three Teachings]] – [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]]-supported [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan lamas]] fell from favor, and the early Ming emperors particularly favored Taoism, granting its practitioners many positions in the state's ritual offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickwang&quot;&gt;Wang, Richard G.

The most influential was [[Matteo Ricci]], whose &quot;[[Kunyu Wanguo Quantu|Map of the Myriad Countries of the World]]&quot; upended [[Chinese geography|traditional geography]] throughout East Asia, and whose work with the convert [[Xu Guangqi]] led to the first Chinese translation of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' in 1607. The discovery of a [[Nestorian stele]] at [[Xi'an]] in 1625 also permitted Christianity to be treated as an old and established faith, rather than as a new and dangerous cult. However, there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the [[Imperial cult#Ancient China|emperor]], [[Confucian temple#Worship|Confucius]], or their [[Chinese ancestor veneration|ancestors]]: Ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the [[Nanjing Incident of 1616]], which exiled four Jesuits to [[Macau]] and forced the others out of public life for six years.{{sfnp|Wong|1963|pp=30–32}} A series of spectacular failures by the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] – including missing an eclipse easily computed by Xu Guangqi and [[Sabatino de Ursis]] – and a return by the Jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the Confucian mold{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=212}} restored their fortunes.

===Philosophy===

====Wang Yangming's Confucianism====
[[File:Wang-yang-ming.jpg|thumb|[[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529), considered the most influential Confucian thinker since [[Zhu Xi]]]]
During the Ming dynasty, the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] doctrines of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] [[scholar-bureaucrat|scholar]] [[Zhu Xi]] were embraced by the court and the Chinese literati at large, although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the [[Yongle Emperor]]'s [[extermination of the ten degrees of kinship]] of [[Fang Xiaoru]] in 1402. The Ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations, however, was [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529), whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to [[Zen|Chan Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=282}} Building upon Zhu Xi's concept of the &quot;extension of knowledge&quot; ({{lang|zh|理學}} or {{lang|zh|格物致知}}), gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events, Wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=281}} Therefore, he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]] had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=281–282}} A peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the [[five Classics|Classics]] but not experienced the real world.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=281–282}}

Other [[scholar-bureaucrat]]s were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=282}} Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin ({{lang|zh|何心隱}}) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=282}} His contemporary [[Li Zhi (Ming dynasty)|Li Zhi]] even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading &quot;dangerous ideas&quot;.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=283}} Yet these &quot;dangerous ideas&quot; of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=158}} and by [[courtesan]]s who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=230}}

The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the [[Censorate]] and by the [[Donglin Academy]], re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=213}}

===Urban and rural life===

Wang Gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the Song dynasty – communities in Ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking. Schools, descent groups, religious associations, and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=206}} [[Jonathan Spence]] writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in Ming China, since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city. Not only was the blurring of town and country evident, but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations (Chinese: {{lang|zh|士農工商}}), since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods, and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=13}}

A variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a father's line of work. This would include – but was not limited to – coffin makers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=20}}{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=12–13}} Virtually every town had a [[brothel]] where female and male prostitutes could be had.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=229, 232}} Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since [[pederasty]] with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of [[sodomy]] being repugnant to sexual norms.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=232–223}} [[Public bathing]] became much more common than in earlier periods.{{sfnp|Schafer|1956|p=57}} Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as [[Joss paper|special paper money]] to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|pp=12–13}} Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=13}}

Farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet, while farmers south of the [[Huai River]] engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised. The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the [[Yangzi River]]; even further south [[sugarcane]] and citrus were grown as basic crops.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=13}} Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo. Besides cutting down trees to sell wood, the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal, and by burning [[oyster]] shells to make [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and fired pots, and weaving mats and baskets.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=95}} In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common, while in the south the myriad of rivers, canals, and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport. Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers, there were on average many more owner-cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate, living not far above subsistence level.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=14}}

Early Ming dynasty saw the strictest [[sumptuary laws]] in Chinese history. It was illegal for commoners to wear fine silk or dress in bright red, dark green or yellow colors; nor could they wear boots or ''[[Ancient Chinese clothing#Hats, headwear and hairstyles|guan]]'' hats. Women could not use ornaments made from gold, jade, pearl or emerald. Merchants and their families were further banned from using silk. However, these laws were no longer enforced from the middle Ming period onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=周绍泉 |title=明代服饰探论 |journal=史学月刊 |year=1990 |issue=6 |pages=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the flourishing of [[Science and technology of the Song dynasty|science and technology in the Song dynasty]], the Ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the [[Western world]]. In fact, key advances in Chinese science in the late Ming were spurred by contact with Europe. In 1626 [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] wrote the first Chinese treatise on the [[telescope]], the ''Yuanjingshuo'' (''Far Seeing Optic Glass''); in 1634 the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] acquired the telescope of the late [[Johann Schreck]] (1576–1630).{{sfnp|Needham|1959|pp=444–445}} The [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system was rejected by the Catholic missionaries in China, but [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ideas slowly trickled into China starting with the Polish Jesuit [[Michael Boym]] (1612–1659) in 1627, Adam Schall von Bell's treatise in 1640, and finally [[Joseph Edkins]], [[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alex Wylie]], and [[John Fryer Thomas Keane|John Fryer]] in the 19th century.{{sfnp|Needham|1959|pp=444–447}} Catholic Jesuits in China would promote [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory at court, yet at the same time embrace the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] system in their writing; it was not until 1865 that Catholic missionaries in China sponsored the heliocentric model as their Protestant peers did.{{sfnp|Wong|1963|loc=p. 31, footnote 1}} Although [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) and [[Guo Shoujing]] (1231–1316) had laid the basis for [[History of trigonometry|trigonometry]] in China, another important work in Chinese trigonometry would not be published again until 1607 with the efforts of Xu Guangqi and Matteo Ricci.{{sfnp|Needham|1959|p=110}} Ironically, some inventions which had their origins in ancient China were reintroduced to China from Europe during the late Ming; for example, the [[Field mill (carriage)|field mill]].{{sfnp|Needham|1965|pp=255–257}}

The [[Chinese calendar]] was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the [[solar year]] at 365 ¼ days, giving an error of 10 min and 14 sec a year or roughly a full day every 128 years.{{sfnp|Kuttner|1975|p=166}} Although the Ming had adopted [[Guo Shoujing]]'s ''Shoushi'' calendar of 1281, which was just as accurate as the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the Ming Directorate of Astronomy failed to periodically readjust it; this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the Ming and the Statutes of the Ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy.{{sfnp|Engelfriet|1998|p=78}} A sixth-generation descendant of the Hongxi Emperor, the &quot;Prince&quot; [[Zhu Zaiyu]] (1536–1611), submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in 1595, but the ultra-conservative astronomical commission rejected it.{{sfnp|Kuttner|1975|p=166}}{{sfnp|Engelfriet|1998|p=78}} This was the same Zhu Zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as [[equal temperament]], a discovery made simultaneously by [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620) in Europe.{{sfnp|Kuttner|1975|pp=166–117}} In addition to publishing his works on music, he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in 1597.{{sfnp|Engelfriet|1998|p=78}} A year earlier, the memorial of Xing Yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the Supervisor of the Astronomical Bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy; Xing would later serve with Xu Guangqi in reforming the calendar (Chinese: {{lang|zh|崇禎暦書}}) in 1629 according to Western standards.{{sfnp|Engelfriet|1998|p=78}}

When the Ming founder Hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the Yuan dynasty's palace at Khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets, [[Automaton|self-operating tiger automata]], dragon-headed devices that spouted mists of perfume, and [[Striking clock|mechanical clocks]] in the tradition of [[Yi Xing]] (683–727) and [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) – he associated all of them with the decadence of Mongol rule and had them destroyed.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|pp=133, 508}} This was described in full length by the Divisional Director of the Ministry of Works, Xiao Xun, who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the Yuan dynasty palace.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|pp=133, 508}} Later, European Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]] would briefly mention indigenous Chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|p=438}} However, both Ricci and Trigault were quick to point out that 16th-century European clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in China, which they listed as [[water clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s, and &quot;other instruments&amp;nbsp;... with wheels rotated by sand as if by water&quot; (Chinese: {{lang|zh|沙漏}}).{{sfnp|Needham|1965|p=509}} Chinese records – namely the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan Shi]]'' – describe the 'five-wheeled sand clock', a mechanism pioneered by Zhan Xiyuan ([[floruit|fl.]] 1360–80) which featured the scoop wheel of Su Song's earlier [[astronomical clock]] and a [[Dial (measurement)|stationary dial face]] over which a pointer circulated, similar to European models of the time.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|p=511}} This sand-driven wheel clock was improved upon by Zhou Shuxue (fl. 1530–58) who added a fourth large gear wheel, changed gear ratios, and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|pp=510–511}}

The Chinese were intrigued with European technology, but so were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology. In 1584, [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1527–1598) featured in his atlas ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'' the peculiar Chinese innovation of [[Wheelbarrow#Chinese sailing carriage|mounting masts and sails onto carriages]], just like [[Junk (ship)|Chinese ships]].{{sfnp|Needham|1965|p=276}} [[Juan González de Mendoza|Gonzales de Mendoza]] also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1512–1594) featured them in his atlas, [[John Milton]] (1608–1674) in one of his famous poems, and [[Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest]] (1739–1801) in the writings of his travel diary in China.{{sfnp|Needham|1965|pp=274–276}}
The encyclopedist [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666) documented a wide array of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'' encyclopedia of 1637. This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation,{{sfnp|Song|1966|pp=7–30, 84–103}} nautical technology such as vessel types and [[snorkeling]] gear for pearl divers,{{sfnp|Song|1966|pp=171–72, 189, 196}}{{sfnp|Needham|1971|p=668}}{{sfnp|Needham|1971|pp=634, 649–50, 668–69}} the annual processes of [[sericulture]] and weaving with the [[loom]],{{sfnp|Song|1966|pp=36–36}} metallurgic processes such as the [[crucible]] technique and [[quench]]ing,{{sfnp|Song|1966|pp=237, 190}} manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron [[pyrite]] in converting sulphide to oxide in [[sulfur]] used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and [[crystallization|crystallize]]{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=126}} – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a [[naval mine]] ignited by use of a rip-cord and [[wheellock|steel flint wheel]].{{sfnp|Needham|1987|pp=205, 339ff}}

[[File:Chinese Cannon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A [[cannon]] from the ''[[Huolongjing]]'', compiled by [[Jiao Yu]] and [[Liu Bowen]] before the latter's death in 1375.]]

Focusing on agriculture in his ''Nongzheng Quanshu'', the agronomist [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) took an interest in irrigation, fertilizers, famine relief, economic and textile crops, and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry.{{sfnp|Needham|1984|pp=65–66}}

There were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms.{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=372}} The ''[[Huolongjing]]'', compiled by [[Jiao Yu]] and [[Liu Bowen]] sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412),{{sfnp|Needham|1987|pp=24–25}} featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled [[round shot|exploding cannonballs]],{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=264}} [[land mine]]s that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses,{{sfnp|Needham|1987|pp=203–205}} naval mines,{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=205}} fin-mounted winged rockets for [[aerodynamic]] control,{{sfnp|Needham|1987|pp=498–502}} [[multistage rocket]]s propelled by [[booster rocket]]s before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile (shaped like a dragon's head),{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=508}} and [[hand cannon]]s that had up to [[gun barrel|ten barrels]].{{sfnp|Needham|1987|p=229}}

[[Li Shizhen]] (1518–1593) – one of the most renowned [[pharmacology|pharmacologists]] and physicians [[Traditional Chinese medicine|in Chinese history]] – belonged to the late Ming period. His ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a ''gang''.

==Population==
[[File:Chen Hongshou, Appreciating Plums, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|''Appreciating Plums'', by [[Chen Hongshou]] (1598–1652) showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum.]]
[[Sinology|Sinologist historians]] debate the population figures for each era in the Ming dynasty. The historian [[Timothy Brook]] notes that the Ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=27}} Children were often underreported, especially female children, as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the Ming.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=267}} Even adult women were underreported;{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=97–99}} for example, the Daming Prefecture in [[North Zhili]] reported a population of 378,167 males and 226,982 females in 1502.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=97}} The government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household, but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=28, 267}} Some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female [[infanticide]]. The practice is well documented in China, going back over two thousand years, and it was described as &quot;rampant&quot; and &quot;practiced by almost every family&quot; by contemporary authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese views of childhood|author=Anne Behnke Kinney|pages=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dramatically skewed sex ratios, which many counties reported exceeding 2:1 by 1586, cannot likely be explained by infanticide alone.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=97–99}}

[[File:Portrait assis de l'empereur Ming Xuanzong.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Xuande Emperor]] (r. 1425–35); he stated in 1428 that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures. But the population was rising under him, a fact noted by Zhou Chen – governor of [[Hebei|South Zhili]] – in his 1432 report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=28}}]]
The number of people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped significantly when the government found that some 3&amp;nbsp;million people were missing from the tax census of 1391.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=27–28}} Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=28}} In his ''Studies on the Population of China'', Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65&amp;nbsp;million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census.{{sfnp|Ho|1959|pp=8–9, 22, 259}} Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62&amp;nbsp;million, while the population was in fact increasing.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=28}} Even the [[Hongzhi Emperor]] (r. 1487–1505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=95}} William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90&amp;nbsp;million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.{{sfnp|Atwell|2002|p=86}}

Historians are now turning to local [[gazetteer]]s of Ming China for clues that would show consistent growth in population.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=267}} Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the [[Chenghua Emperor]] (r. 1464–87) was roughly 75&amp;nbsp;million,{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=28, 267}} despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=95}} While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|pp=94–96}} The [[Hongzhi Emperor|Hongzhi]] and [[Zhengde Emperor|Zhengde]] emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=97}}

Even with the Jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants, by the late Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=162}} Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160&amp;nbsp;million in the late Ming dynasty,{{sfnp|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=128}} while Brook estimates 175&amp;nbsp;million,{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=162}} and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=195}} However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a gazetteer in northern [[Zhejiang]] noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.{{sfnp|Brook|1998|p=163}}

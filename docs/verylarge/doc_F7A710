The decision in favour of West Ham's bid was unanimous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12424549 |title=West Ham chosen as preferred Olympic Stadium tenant |work=BBC News|date= 11 February 2011|access-date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23922167-spurs-ready-for-legal-battle-as-west-ham-win-olympic-stadium-bid.do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212153349/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23922167-spurs-ready-for-legal-battle-as-west-ham-win-olympic-stadium-bid.do |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 February 2011 |title=Spurs ready for legal battle as West Ham win Olympic stadium bid |work=London Evening Standard |access-date=6 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their [[Brisbane Road|Brisbane Road ground]] could steal support from the club and put them out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13082972 |title=Leyton Orient in 2012 Olympic stadium High Court action |work=BBC News|date=14 April 2011 |access-date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/23/tottenham-olympic-stadium-judicial-review |title=Tottenham fail with appeal over West Ham's use of the Olympic Stadium |work=The Guardian |date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]].

On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the [[Westfield London Shopping Centre|Westfield Shopping Centre]] had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2011/06/06/westfield-to-sponsor-west-ham-olympic-stadium |title=Westfield to sponsor West Ham Olympic stadium |work=Construction Enquirer |date= 8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name=Stratford&gt;{{cite news|title=West Ham to call 2012 stadium home after Games|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-olympics/article-23980097-west-ham-to-call-2012-stadium-home-after-games.do|access-date=22 August 2011|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=22 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent inquiry into Olympic Stadium decision clears West Ham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/23/inquiry-olympic-stadium-west-ham|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs return to High Court over Olympic Stadium verdict|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/13964363|work=BBC Sport|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spurs win Olympic review|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/7122003/spurs-win-olympic-review|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012: West Ham Olympic Stadium deal collapses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15251893|work=BBC Sport|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham Hotspur ends 2012 Olympic Stadium legal bid|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15344523|work=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the original deal collapsed, a new process to select a tenant was begun. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brady&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20111011/west-ham-newham-statement_2236884_2478075 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012233754/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20111011/west-ham-newham-statement_2236884_2478075 | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 October 2011 | title=West Ham&amp;nbsp;– Newham Statement | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | date=11 October 2011 | access-date=11 October 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2012, West Ham was one of the four bidders for the Stadium. With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012, Mayor of London Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating that it was &quot;overwhelmingly likely&quot; that the tenants would be West Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/16335-west-ham-among-four-formal-bidders-for-london-2012-olympic-stadium|title=West Ham among four formal bidders for London 2012 Olympic Stadium|first=David| last=Gold|work=insidethegames.biz|date=23 March 2012|access-date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borisdecides&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelso|first=Paul|title=London 2012 Olympics: West Ham likely to get Olympic Stadium despite delays, says Boris Johnson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9271826/London-2012-Olympics-West-Ham-likely-to-get-Olympic-Stadium-despite-delays-says-Boris-Johnson.html|access-date=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 22 March 2013 that West Ham had signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £1&amp;nbsp;million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was to move into the stadium prior to the start of the [[2016–17 in English football|2016–17 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=West Ham get Olympic Stadium after government ups funding|journal=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21889864|first=David| last=Bond|date=22 March 2013|access-date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benge|first1=James|title=Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham fan coalition's call for public inquiry into West Ham Olympic stadium deal rejected by government|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/government-rejects-arsenal-chelsea-and-tottenham-fan-coalitions-bid-for-public-inquiry-into-west-ham-a2926561.html|access-date=4 September 2015|work=London Evening Standard|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Academy of Football==
{{Main|The Academy of Football}}
[[File:Footballacademy.JPG|200px|right|thumb|&quot;Academy of Football&quot;]]
The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being &quot;[[The Academy of Football]]&quot;, with the moniker adorning the ground's new stadium façade. The comment predominantly refers to the club's youth development system which was established by manager [[Ted Fenton]] during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1192517.stm |title=Hammer house of legends |work=BBC Sport |date=27 February 2001 |access-date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the club contributed three players to the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup-winning]] [[England national football team|England]] side of 1966, including club icon [[Bobby Moore]], as well as [[Martin Peters]] and [[Geoff Hurst]] who between them scored all of England's goals in the eventual 4–2 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included [[Trevor Brooking]], [[Alvin Martin]], [[Tony Cottee]] and [[Paul Ince]].

Since the late 1990s, [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Frank Lampard]], [[Joe Cole]], [[Michael Carrick]] and [[Glen Johnson (English footballer)|Glen Johnson]] began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for much bigger clubs. Most recently, the likes of first teamers [[Mark Noble]] and [[James Tomkins (footballer)|James Tomkins]], as well as Welsh international [[Jack Collison]], have emerged through the Academy. Frustratingly for fans and managers alike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418151747/http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 April 2005 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=19 December 2007 |access-date=6 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529201217/http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archive-date=29 May 2006 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=29 May 2006 |access-date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Ham, during the 2007–08 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7417746.stm |work=BBC Sport | title=England player numbers at new low | date=27 May 2008 | access-date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having &quot;homegrown players.&quot; Between 2000 and 2011, the club produced eight England players, as many as Manchester United and one fewer than Arsenal.&lt;ref name=Number&gt;{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Tim|title=Fergie's four-letter outburst at the FA|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/fergies-fourletter-outburst-at-the-fa-2344578.html|access-date=30 August 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the success of The Academy has been attributed to [[Tony Carr]], who was West Ham youth coach between 1973 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/03/12/tony-carr-best-developer-young-talent-english-football-keen/|title=Tony Carr - the best developer of young talent in English football - keen to rebuild bridges at West Ham|first=William|last=Pugh|date=12 March 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifetime Achievement Award===
In 2013, West Ham United introduced a new annual award, the West Ham United Lifetime Achievement Award.

The first award was presented to club-record appearance maker [[Billy Bonds]], who picked up the award on the pitch at Upton Park before kick-off against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on the opening day of the [[2013–14 West Ham United F.C. season|2013–14 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130818/bonds-honoured-at-the-boleyn_2236884_3365079 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819102820/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130818/bonds-honoured-at-the-boleyn_2236884_3365079 | url-status=dead | archive-date=19 August 2013 | title=Bonds Honoured at the Boleyn | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 award was presented to Sir [[Trevor Brooking]], a record five-time winner of the Hammer of the Year award. Brooking received the award before the [[2014–15 West Ham United F.C. season|2014–15 season]] curtain-raiser against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11685/9300736/west-ham-award-for-sir-trevor-brooking | title=West Ham award for Sir Trevor Brooking | publisher=Sky Sports | access-date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooking had already had the Centenary Stand at the Boleyn ground named after him in 2009.

The 2015 award was awarded to [[Martin Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20150210/hammers-to-honour-peters_2236884_4476925 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216010414/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20150210/hammers-to-honour-peters_2236884_4476925 | url-status=dead | archive-date=16 February 2015 | title=Hammers to honour Peters | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=25 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2016, it was announced via the club's official website that the fourth recipient of the award would be Sir [[Geoff Hurst]], the club's second all-time leading goalscorer, and scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] Final. Hurst would be honoured at the club's 2015/16 Player Awards Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/3-May/Hurst-to-be-honoured-at-Player-Awards | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604014603/http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2016/May/3-May/Hurst-to-be-honoured-at-Player-Awards | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 June 2016 | title=Hurst to be honoured at Player Awards | publisher=West Ham United F.C. | access-date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Brown (footballer)|Ken Brown]] became the sixth recipient of the award, in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/april/25-april/wonderful-ken-brown-set-receive-lifetime-achievement-award|title='Wonderful' Ken Brown set to receive Lifetime Achievement Award |publisher=West Ham United F.C.|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2019 honour was awarded to [[midfielder]] [[Ronnie Boyce]] who made his debut for West Ham in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2018/october/22-october/ronnie-boyce-hammers-legend-who-debuted-58-years-ago-today | title=Ronnie Boyce: The Hammers legend who debuted 58 years ago today &amp;#124; West Ham United}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dick Tracy''''' is an American comic strip featuring [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]] (originally Plainclothes Tracy),&lt;ref&gt;[[American Pickers]], Urban Cowboys&lt;/ref&gt; a tough and intelligent police detective created by [[Chester Gould]]. It made its debut on Sunday, October 4, 1931 in the ''[[Detroit Mirror]]'',&lt;ref name=ME/&gt; and it was distributed by the [[Tribune Media Services|Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate]]. Gould wrote and drew the strip until 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;ME&quot;&gt;webpage:

Dick Tracy has also been the hero in a number of films, including [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|''Dick Tracy'']] in which [[Warren Beatty]] played the lead in 1990. [[Tom De Haven]] praised Gould's ''Dick Tracy'' as an &quot;outrageously funny American Gothic&quot;, while Brian Walker described it as a &quot;ghoulishly entertaining creation&quot; which had &quot;gripping stories filled with violence and pathos&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;De Haven, &quot;[https://ew.com/article/1990/10/05/your-guide-classic-comic-strips/ Your guide to classic comic-strips]&quot;.

==Comic strip==
===Creation and early years===
Basing the character on U.S. federal agent [[Eliot Ness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.atf.gov/our-history/eliot-ness |title=Eliot Ness |publisher=[[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] |access-date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould drafted an idea for a detective named &quot;Plainclothes Tracy&quot; and sent it to [[Joseph Medill Patterson]] of the [[Tribune Content Agency|Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate]]. Patterson suggested changing the hero's name to Dick Tracy, and also put forward an opening storyline in which Tracy joined the police after his girlfriend's father was murdered by robbers. Gould agreed to these ideas, and ''Dick Tracy'' was first published on October 4, 1931. The strip was instantly popular, and was soon appearing in newspapers across the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot; /&gt; The strip's popularity also resulted in the creation of numerous ''Dick Tracy'' merchandise, including novelizations, toys, and games. In April 1937, a poll of adult comic strip readers in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' voted ''Dick Tracy'' their third favourite comic strip after ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' and ''[[Popeye]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot; /&gt; However, ''Dick Tracy'' was also attacked by some journalists as being too violent, a criticism that would dog Gould throughout his time on the strip.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot; /&gt;

===Characters and story===
{{POV section|date=May 2013}}
Tracy uses [[forensic science]], advanced gadgetry, and wits in an early example of the [[police procedural]] mystery story—although stories often end in gunfights just the same. Stories typically follow a criminal committing a crime followed by Tracy's relentless pursuit. The strip's most popular [[List of Dick Tracy villain debuts|villain]] was [[Flattop (Dick Tracy villain)|Flattop Jones]], a freelance hitman hired by [[black market]]eers to murder Tracy. When Flattop was killed, fans went into public mourning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Flattop story was reprinted in ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly|first=Rob|title=The World's Second Greatest Detective: Dick Tracy |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=71|pages=48–49|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villains' small crimes led to bigger, out-of-control situations, reflecting [[film noir]]. Similarly, innocent witnesses were frequently killed, and Tracy's paramour [[Tess Trueheart (character)|Tess Trueheart]] was often endangered by the villains. As the story progressed, Tracy adopted an orphan under the name Dick Tracy Jr., or &quot;Junior&quot; for short, who appeared in investigations until becoming a police [[forensic artist]] in his father's precinct. He also cultivated a professional partner, ex-steelworker Pat Patton, who gradually became a detective of skill and courage enough to satisfy Tracy's requirements.
{{Original research section|date=November 2014}}
Tracy characters were often caricatures of celebrities. There was [[Breathless Mahoney]], modeled after [[Veronica Lake]].{{sfn|Roberts|1993|pp=105&amp;ndash;6}} Likewise, B.O. Plenty was inspired by [[George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes]] (with perhaps a nod to [[Al St. John]] also), Vitamin Flintheart by [[John Barrymore]],{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=99}} and Spike Dyke by [[Spike Jones]]. Others include villains like Rughead ([[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), Oodles ([[Jackie Gleason]]) and Mumbles ([[Bing Crosby]]).  Gould even parodied himself as the out-of-shape Pearshape.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The character Barnek was modeled after real life Chicago police officer and martial arts trainer Stanley Sarbenak.

===Evolution of the strip===
{{anchor|WristRadio}}
On January 13, 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Garyn G. Roberts, ''Dick Tracy and American Culture: Morality and Mythology, Text and Context'' (McFarland, 2003), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; the two-Way Wrist Radio became one of the strip's most immediately recognizable icons, worn as a wristwatch by Tracy and members of the police force. This radio wristwatch inspired [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]]'s invention of the mobile phone, and may have inspired later [[smartwatch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-dick-tracy-invented-smartwatch-180954506/ |title=How Dick Tracy Invented the Smartwatch |date=March 9, 2015 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-Way Wrist Radio was upgraded to a two-Way Wrist TV in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;https://infostory.com/2011/01/24/the-evolution-of-dick-tracys-wristwatch/&lt;/ref&gt; This development also led to the introduction of an important supporting character, Diet Smith, an eccentric industrialist who financed the development of this equipment. In a conspicuous coincidence, the idea of a radio built into a wrist watch played an important role in the story line of &quot;Superman – The Talking Cat&quot; broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System on January 9 through 28, 1946 (episodes 878 through 891).

In late 1948, a botched security detail led to the death of the semi-regular character Brilliant, the [[Blindness|blind]] inventor of the two-Way Wrist Radio (among other devices) whereupon Chief Brandon, Dick Tracy's superior on the police force and a presence in the strip since 1931, resigned in shame and Pat Patton was promoted to police chief in Brandon's place on Tracy's recommendation after declining promotion himself, previously having been Tracy's buffoonish partner. A new character was introduced named Sam Catchem to take Patton's place as Tracy's sidekick.

===The 1950s===
[[File:Spike Dyke Dick Tracy.jpg|right|thumb|370px|In 1949, [[Spike Jones]] was caricatured in the ''Dick Tracy'' dailies as Spike Dyke.]]

Gould introduced topical story lines about television, [[juvenile delinquency]], [[Police corruption|graft]], [[organized crime]], and other developments in American life during the 1950s; and elements of [[soap opera]] depicted Dick, Tess, and Junior (along with the Tracys' baby daughter Bonnie Braids) at home as a family. Depictions of family life alternated with the story's crime drama, as in the kidnapping of Bonnie Braids by fugitive Crewy Lou, or Junior's girlfriend Model being accidentally killed by her brother.

Gould incurred some controversy when he had Tracy live in an unaccountably ostentatious manner on a police officer's salary, and responded with a story wherein Tracy was accused of corruption and had to explain the origin of his possessions in detail. In his book-length examination of the strip, ''Dick Tracy – The Official Biography'', Jay Maeder suggested that Gould's critics were unsatisfied by his explanation. Nevertheless, the controversy eventually faded, and the cartoonist reduced exposure to Tracy's home life.

[[File:Dicktracy10121941.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Chester Gould's Dick Tracy vs. &quot;The Mole&quot; (October 12, 1941)]]

Tracy's cases generally incriminated independent operators rather than organized crime—with a few exceptions, such as [[Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice|Big Boy]], a fictionalized version of [[Al Capone]] and the strip's first villain. Tracy opposed a series of big-time mobsters in the 1950s, such as the King, George &quot;Mr. Crime&quot; Alpha, Odds Zonn, and Willie &quot;The Fifth&quot; Millyun, after events like the [[Kefauver Hearings]]. As Tess faded into the background, Tracy assumed as his assistant the rookie policewoman Lizz Worthington.

From 1956 to 1964, the ''Dick Tracy'' Sunday page was accompanied by a [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] humor strip called ''The Gravies'' and drawn by Gould and his assistants.

===Space period===
As technology progressed, the methods that Tracy and the police used to track and capture criminals took the form of increasingly fanciful [[atom]]ic-powered gadgets developed by Diet Smith Industries. This eventually led to the 1960s advent of the Space Coupe, a spacecraft with a magnetic propulsion system. This marked the beginning of the strip's &quot;Space Period,&quot; which saw Tracy and friends having adventures on the Moon and meeting [[Moon Maid (comics)|Moon Maid]], the daughter of the leader of a race of humanoid people living in &quot;Moon Valley&quot; in 1964. After an eventual sharing of technological information, Moon technology became standard issue on Tracy's police force, including air cars, flying cylindrical vehicles. The villains became even more exaggerated in power, resulting in an escalating series of stories that no longer resembled the urban crime drama roots of the strip. During this period, Tracy met famed cartoonist Chet Jade, creator of the comic strip ''Sawdust'', in which the only characters are talking dots.

One of the new characters, Mr. Intro, was only manifested as a disembodied voice. His goal was world domination in the vein of a [[James Bond]] villain. Tracy eventually used an atomic laser beam to annihilate Intro and his island base.

Junior married Moon Maid in October 1964. Their daughter Honey Moon Tracy had antennae and magnetic hands. In the spring of 1969, Tracy was offered the post of Chief of Police in Moon Valley. However, he ended up back on Earth when the [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969 showed that the moon was barren of all life. Many of the accoutrements of the space period stories remained for many years afterward, such as the Space Coupe and much of the high-tech gadgetry. Moon Maid receded from the storyline.

The stories of this period took an increasingly condemnatory tone pertaining to contemporary court decisions concerning the [[rights of the accused]], which often involved Tracy being frustrated by legal technicalities. For example, having caught a gang of diamond thieves red-handed, Tracy was forced to let them walk because he could not ''prove'' beyond a reasonable doubt that the diamonds were stolen. As he saw the thieves get off without penalty, Tracy was heard to grumble, &quot;Yes, under today's interpretation of the laws, it seems it's the police who are handcuffed!&quot;

The strip was criticized for advocating violence in 1968. On June 7 — the day after Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was killed by an assassin — the strip's final panel announced, &quot;Violence is golden, when it's used to put down evil.&quot; The strip was obviously prepared weeks before the assassination, but the timing of the strip's publication attracted negative attention. Some newspapers dropped the strip as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Tracydickmarch870.jpg|thumb|400px|Color guide for ''Dick Tracy'' (March 8, 1970)]]
In the 1970s, Gould modernized Tracy by giving him a longer hairstyle and a [[mustache]], and added a [[hippie]] [[sidekick]], Groovy Grove. Groovy's first appearance in print, as it happened, occurred during the same week as the [[Kent State shootings]]. Groovy remained with the strip, off and on until his death in 1984.

Shortly before his retirement, Gould drew a strip in which Sam, Lizz, and Groovy held Tracy down to shave off his mustache.

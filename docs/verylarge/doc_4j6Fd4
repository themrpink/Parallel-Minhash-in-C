==History==
{{Missing information|section|the origins of psychedelic culture that is available for copy at  [[Acid rock#Origins and ideology]]. |date=January 2017}}

From the second half of the 1950s, [[Beat Generation]] writers like [[William Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Campbell, ''This is the Beat Generation: New York, San Francisco, Paris'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-520-23033-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about and took drugs, including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[Benzedrine]], raising awareness and helping to popularise their use.&lt;ref&gt;R. Worth, ''Illegal Drugs: Condone Or Incarcerate?'' (Marshall Cavendish, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7614-4234-0}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period [[Lysergic acid diethylamide]], better known as LSD, or &quot;acid&quot; (at the time a legal drug), began to be used in the US and UK as an experimental treatment, initially promoted as a potential cure for mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Farber, &quot;The Psychologists Psychology:The Intoxicated State/Illegal Nation - Drugs in the Sixties Counterculture&quot;, in P. Braunstein and M. W. Doyle (eds), ''Imagine Nation: The Counterculture of the 1960s and '70s'' (New York: Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|0-415-93040-5}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by proponents of the new &quot;consciousness expansion&quot;, such as [[Timothy Leary]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Arthur Koestler]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Applebaum]], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/26/did-the-death-of-communis_n_435939.html &quot;Did The Death Of Communism Take Koestler And Other Literary Figures With It?]&quot;, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.cthome.net/tobelman/The_Out-Of-Sight_SMiLE_Site.html|title=''Out-Of-Sight!''

R. Veysey, ''[[The Communal Experience: Anarchist and Mystical Communities in Twentieth-Century America]]'' (Chicago IL, University of Chicago Press, 1978), {{ISBN|0-226-85458-2}}, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; There had long been a culture of drug use among [[jazz]] and [[blues]] musicians, and use of drugs (including cannabis, [[peyote]], [[mescaline]] and LSD&lt;ref&gt;T. Albright, ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay area, 1945-1980: an Illustrated History]]'' (University of California Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0-520-05193-9}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;) had begun to grow among folk and rock musicians, who also began to include drug references in their songs.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), {{ISBN|0-8264-6321-5}}, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|New York folk musician [[Peter Stampfel]] claimed to be the first to use the word &quot;psychedelic&quot; in a song lyric ([[The Holy Modal Rounders]]' version of &quot;[[Hesitation Blues]]&quot;, 1963).{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=8}}}}

By the mid-1960s, the psychedelic life-style had already developed in California, and an entire [[subculture]] developed. This was particularly true in San Francisco, due in part to the first major underground LSD factory, established there by [[Owsley Stanley]].{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|pp=8–9}} There was also an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations catering to a population of students at nearby [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and to free thinkers that had gravitated to the city.&lt;ref name=Unterberger2003pp11-13&gt;R.

Mann, ''Turn on and Tune in: Psychedelics, Narcotics and Euphoriants'' (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2009), {{ISBN|1-84755-909-3}}, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary was a well-known proponent of the use of psychedelics, as was [[Aldous Huxley]]. However, both advanced widely different opinions on the broad use of psychedelics by [[State (polity)|state]] and [[civil society]].  Leary promulgated the idea of such substances as a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]], while Huxley suggested that only the cultural and intellectual elite should partake of entheogens systematically.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s]] the use of psychedelic drugs became widespread in modern [[Western culture]], particularly in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The movement is credited to [[Michael Hollingshead]] who arrived in America from London in 1965. He was sent to the U.S. by other members of the psychedelic movement to get their ideas exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, Andrew|title=Summer of Love: Psychedelic Art, Social Crisis and Counterculture in the 1960s|year=2007|publisher=[[Liverpool University Press]]|location=Liverpool|edition=8|chapter=Spontaneous Underground: An Introduction to Psychedelic Scenes, 1965-1968|editor=Christopher Grunenberg, Jonathan Harris|pages=63–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Summer of Love]] of 1967 and the resultant popularization of the [[hippie]] culture to the mainstream popularized psychedelia in the minds of [[popular culture]], where it remained dominant through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/the-summer-of-love-was-more-than-hippies-and-lsd-it-was-the-start-of-modern-individualism-77212|title=The Summer of Love was more than hippies and LSD – it was the start of modern individualism|website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
[[Image:PsychedelicVACHulaHoop.JPG|thumb|A [[retro]] example of psychedelia; the dancer combines 1960s fashion with modern LED lighting.]]
The impact of psychedelic drugs on western culture in the 1960s led to [[semantic drift]] in the use of the word &quot;psychedelic&quot;, and it is now frequently used to describe anything with abstract decoration of multiple bright colours, similar to those seen in drug-induced hallucinations. In objection to this new meaning, and to what some{{Who|date=June 2011}} consider [[pejorative]] meanings of other synonyms such as &quot;[[hallucinogen]]&quot; and &quot;[[psychotomimetic]]&quot;, the term &quot;entheogen&quot; was proposed and is seeing increasing use. However, many consider the term &quot;entheogen&quot; best reserved for religious and spiritual usage, such as certain Native American churches do with the peyote sacrament, and &quot;psychedelic&quot; left to describe those who are using these drugs for recreation, psychotherapy, physical healing, or creative problem solving.  In science, [[hallucinogen]] remains the standard term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/drugs-world/|title=Drugs World |publisher=Informationisbeautiful.net|accessdate=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing and photographic technology in the 1960s saw the traditional [[lithography]] printing techniques rapidly superseded by the [[offset printing]] system. This and other technical and industrial innovations gave young artists access to exciting new graphic techniques and media, including photographic and mixed media collage, metallic foils, and vivid new fluorescent &quot;[[DayGlo]]&quot; inks. This enabled them to explore innovative new illustrative styles including highly distorted visuals, cartoons, and lurid colors and full [[spectrum]]s to evoke a sense of altered consciousness; many works also featured idiosyncratic and complex new fonts and lettering styles (most notably in the work of San Francisco-based poster artist Rick Griffin). Many artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience in  [[paintings]], [[drawings]], [[illustration]]s, and other forms of graphic design. In the modern era, [[computer graphics]] may be used to produce psychedelic effects for artwork.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] music scene frequently used psychedelic designs on posters during the [[Summer of Love]], leading to a popularization of the style. The most productive and influential centre of psychedelic art in the late 1960s was [[San Francisco]]; a scene driven in large measure by the patronage of the popular local music venues of the day like the [[Avalon Ballroom]] and [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Fillmore West]], which regularly commissioned young local artists like [[Robert Crumb]], [[Stanley Mouse]], [[Rick Griffin]] and others. They produced a wealth of distinctive psychedelic promotional [[poster]]s and handbills for concerts that featured emerging psychedelic bands like [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[The Grateful Dead]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]]. Many of these works  are now regarded as classics of the poster genre, and original items by these artists command high prices on the collector market today. [[Peter Max]]'s psychedelic poster designs helped popularize brightly colored spectrums widely, especially among [[college]] students.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Contemporary with the burgeoning San Francisco scene, a smaller but equally creative psychedelic art movement emerged in London, led by expatriate Australian pop artist [[Martin Sharp]], who created many striking psychedelic posters and illustrations for the influential underground publication [[Oz magazine]], as well as the famous album covers for the [[Cream (band)|Cream]] albums ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' and ''[[Wheels of Fire]]''. Other prominent London practitioners of the style included: design duo [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]], whose work included numerous famous posters, as well as psychedelic &quot;makeovers&quot; on a piano for [[Paul McCartney]] and a car for doomed [[Guinness]] heir [[Tara Browne]], and  design collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]], who created clothes and album art for several leading UK bands including [[The Beatles]], Cream, and [[The Move]]. The Beatles loved psychedelic designs on their albums, and designer group called The Fool created psychedelic design, art, paint at the short-lived [[Apple Boutique]] (1967–1968) in Baker St, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.strawberrywalrus.com/applestore.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818095857/http://www.strawberrywalrus.com/applestore.html |archive-date=2006-08-18 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Janis Joplin's Porsche 356 convertible.jpg|thumb|right|Joplin's [[Porsche 356]]C in &quot;[[Summer of Love]] – Art of the Psychedelic Era&quot; at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York City.]]

Blues rock singer Janis Joplin had psychedelic car Porsche 356. The trend also extended to motor vehicles. The earliest, and perhaps most famous of all psychedelic vehicles was the famous &quot;[[Further (bus)|Further]]&quot; bus, driven by [[Ken Kesey]] and [[The Merry Pranksters]], which was painted inside and out in 1964 with bold psychedelic designs (although these were executed in primary colours, since the DayGlo colours that soon became ''de rigueur'' were then not widely available). Another very famous example is the Rolls Royce owned by [[John Lennon]] – originally black, he had it repainted in 1967 in a vivid psychedelic gypsy caravan style, prompting bandmate George Harrison to have his [[Mini Cooper]] similarly repainted with logos and devices that reflected his burgeoning interest in Indian spirituality.

==Music==
{{Main|Psychedelic music}}

The fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia, a term describing a category of [[rock music]] known as [[psychedelic rock]], as well as [[visual art]], [[fashion]], and [[culture]] that is associated originally with the high 1960s, hippies, and the [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Campbell, ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on'' (Boston, MA: [[Cengage Learning]], 3rd edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-495-50530-7}}, pp. 212-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It often used new recording techniques and effects while drawing on [[Music of Asia|Eastern sources]] such as the [[raga]]s and [[Drone (music)|drones]] of [[Music of India|Indian music]].

One of the first uses of the word in the music scene of this time was in the 1964 recording of  &quot;[[Hesitation Blues]]&quot; by folk group the [[Holy Modal Rounders]].&lt;ref name=Hicks2000&gt;M. Hicks, ''Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions'' (Chicago IL: [[University of Illinois Press]], 2000), {{ISBN|0-252-06915-3}}, pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to rock music and popularized by the [[13th Floor Elevators]] 1966 album ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]''.&lt;ref name=Hicks2000/&gt; Psychedelia truly took off in 1967 with the [[Summer of Love]] and, although associated with San Francisco, the style soon spread across the [[United States|US]], and worldwide.&lt;ref name=AllmusicPsych&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|S. T. Erlewine]], ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: [[Backbeat Books]], 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0-87930-653-X}}, pp. 1322-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterculture of the 1960s had a strong influence on the popular culture of the early 1970s. It later became linked to a style of [[electronic dance music]] known as [[psychedelic trance]].

==Festivals==
[[File:Rave xxxperience bh.jpg|Psychedelic Festival in [[Brazil]]|thumb]]

A psychedelic festival is a gathering that promotes [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic art|art]] in an effort to unite participants in a communal [[psychedelic experience]].&lt;ref name=StJohn /&gt; Psychedelic festivals have been described as &quot;temporary communities reproduced via personal and collective acts of transgression ... through the routine expenditure of excess energy, and through self-sacrifice in acts of abandonment involving ecstatic dancing often fuelled by chemical cocktails.&quot;&lt;ref name=StJohn&gt;St John, Graham.

'''Pope Evaristus''' was the [[bishop of Rome]]  from {{circa|lk=no}} 99 to his death {{circa|lk=no}} 107.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Evaristus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', he died in 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as '''Aristus'''. He is venerated as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/ortpopes.htm Orthodox England - The Holy Orthodox Popes of Rome]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].
He is usually accorded the title of martyr; however, there is no confirmation of this. It is likely that he was the bishop of Rome when [[John the Apostle]] died, marking the end of the [[Apostolic Age]].

==Biography==
Little is known about Evaristus. According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he came from a family of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek Jews]] living in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;(bibliothecarius)1602&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anastasius (bibliothecarius)|title=Bibliothecarii Historia, de vitis romanorvm pontificvm a b.Petro apostolo vsqve ad Nicolavm I. nunquam hactenus typis excusa.

[[Eusebius]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' IV, I, stated that Evaristus died in the 12th year of the reign of Emperor [[Trajan]] after holding the office of bishop of the Romans for eight years. He is said by the ''Liber Pontificalis'' to have divided Rome into several [[Titular church|titles]], assigning a [[priest]] to each, and appointed seven [[deacon]]s for the city.

'''Smoke testing''' refers to various classes of tests of systems, usually intended to determine whether they are ready for more robust testing. The expression probably was first used in [[plumbing]] in referring to tests for the detection of cracks, leaks or breaks in closed systems of pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonhygien01stev Stevenson, Thomas. A Treatise on Hygiene and Public Health, Volume 1. Published by: J. &amp; A. Churchill, 1892]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

The plumbing industry started using the smoke test in 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoyalScottishSocietyArts1891&quot;&gt;Buchan, W.P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GBc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22smoke+test%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nuD7TfjsH5KcgQfknJ3nCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22smoke%20test%22&amp;f=false&quot; Institution of the Smoke-Test for Drains]. Read before the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, 13 April 1891. Retrieved 2011-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smoke testing in various industries ==

=== Plumbing ===
In [[plumbing]] a smoke test forces non-toxic, [[smoke bomb|artificially created smoke]] through waste and drain pipes under a slight pressure to find leaks.&lt;ref name=masterplumbers&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masterplumbers.com/plumbviews/2002/smoketesting.asp|title=Smoke Testing: The Diagnostic Secret Weapon|publisher=masterplumbers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plumes of smoke form where there are defects. This test can be performed when the plumbing is brand new, but more often it is used to find sewer gas leaks that may plague a building or an area.&lt;ref name=masterplumbers/&gt; Any sign of smoke escaping can be considered a possible site for sewer gas to escape. Sewer gas typically has a rotten egg smell and can contain [[methane gas]], which is explosive, or [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas, which is deadly.

Plumbing smoke tests are also used to find places where pipes will spill fluid,&lt;ref name=masterplumbers/&gt; and to check [[sanitary sewer]] systems for places where ground water and storm runoff can enter. Smoke testing is particularly useful in places such as ventilated sanitary sewer systems, where completely sealing the system is not practical.

When smoke testing a [[sanitary sewer]] system it is helpful to partially block off the section of sewer to be tested. This can be done by using a sand bag on the end of a rope. The sand bag is lowered into the manhole and swung into position to partially block lines. Completely blocking the line can cause water to back up and prevent smoke from escaping through defects. Smoke testing may not be done after rain or when ground water is unusually high as this may also prevent detection of defects.

Large downdraft fans, usually powered by gasoline engines, are placed on top of open [[manhole]]s at either end of the section to be tested. If possible all lines in the manholes except for the line between the manholes are partially blocked. Smoke is created using either a [[smoke bomb]] or liquid smoke. Smoke bombs are lit and placed on a grate or in a holder on top of each fan, while liquid smoke is injected into the fan via a heating chamber. The fans create a pressure differential that forces the smoke into the sewer at a pressure just above atmospheric. With properly installed plumbing, the [[Plumbing trap|traps]] will prevent the smoke from entering the house and redirect it out the plumbing vents. Defective plumbing systems or dry traps will allow smoke to enter the inside of the house.
[[File:Smoke_Testing,_726_Emma_Ave,_Springdale,_AR.jpg|right|thumb|Smoke testing a sanitary sewer produces visible smoke at a residence in [[Springdale, Arkansas]]]]
The area around the section being tested is searched for smoke plumes. Plumes coming from plumbing vents or the interface between the fan shroud and manhole rim are normal; however, smoke plumes outside of the manhole rim are not. Plumes are marked, usually with flags, and defects are noted using measurements from stationary landmarks like the corners of houses. The plumes or markers may also be photographed.

=== Woodwind instrument repair ===
In [[woodwind instrument]] repair, a smoke test involves plugging one end of an instrument and blowing smoke into the other to test for leaks. Escaping smoke reveals improperly seated pads and faulty joints (i.e. leaks). After this test the instrument is cleaned to remove nicotine and other deposits left by the smoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodwind instruments and their history&quot;&gt;Anthony Baines, Woodwind Instruments and their history&quot;, 1967 (page 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to tobacco smoke being used, this test may be hazardous to the health of the technician in the long run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Described in a repair manual written in the 1930s,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} smoke testing is considered obsolete, {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and is no longer used by reputable technicians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The usual alternative to smoke is to place a bright light inside the instrument then check for light appearing around pads and joints.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Automotive repair ===
In the same way that plumbing and woodwind instruments are tested, the [[vacuum]] systems of automobiles may be tested in order to locate difficult-to-find vacuum leaks. Artificial smoke is deliberately introduced into the system under slight pressure and any leaks are indicated by the escaping smoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;pm&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/maintenance/how-to-find-a-vacuum-leak|title=How to Find a Vacuum Leak|last=Allen|first=Mike|date=2011-02-28|website=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2019-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke can also be used to locate difficult-to-find leaks in the fuel evaporative emissions control ([[EVAP]]) system.&lt;ref name=&quot;pm&quot;/&gt;

=== Infectious disease control ===
[[File:Smoke generator.png|alt=A hand grasping a small blue apparatus with white smoke emerging from its top|thumb|upright|A smoke generator used to visualize air flow.  Smoke generators provide a low-cost method to visualize air flow patterns around [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard control]] measures, including in and around [[Fume hood|fume hoods]] and pressure differences between adjacent areas or rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=9–20|access-date=2017-03-05|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2014102|doi-access=free}} {{PD-inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[infectious disease]] control a smoke test is done to see whether a room is under [[Negative room pressure|negative pressure]]. A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not at negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

On May 13, 2015, [[Military of Burundi|Burundi army]] General Godefroid Niyombareh, former head of Burundian intelligence, [[Burundian unrest|declared a coup]] via radio while Nkurunziza was abroad attending a summit in [[Tanzania]] with other African leaders. Niyombareh had been fired by the President in February. Despite reports that gunshots had been heard and people were celebrating in the streets of the capital, government officials dismissed the threat and claimed to remain in control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Melvin|first1=Don|date=May 13, 2015|title=Amid fears of ethnic violence, coup attempt reported in Burundi|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/13/africa/burundi-coup-attempt/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition groups announced on 26 June that they would boycott the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/26/us-burundi-politics-idUSKBN0P60X520150626|title=Burundi crisis escalates as opposition boycotts elections|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/burundi-crisis-escalates-as-opposition-boycotts-elections-775623|title=Burundi Crisis Escalates as Opposition Boycotts Elections|date=26 June 2015|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to a Kenyan television station on 6 July, one of the coup leaders, General [[Leonard Ngendakumana]], called for armed rebellion against Nkurunziza. He said that his group was responsible for the grenade attacks and said that &quot;our intent is to intensify&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/06/us-burundi-politics-idUSKCN0PG1OE20150706 &quot;Burundi coup general says force only way to oust president&quot;], Reuters, 6 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting was reported in northern Burundi on 10&amp;ndash;11 July.&lt;ref name=Gunmen&gt;Clement Manirabarusha, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/12/us-burundi-politics-idUSKCN0PM0EV20150712 &quot;Gunmen captured, killed by Burundi army in clashes in north: governor&quot;], Reuters, 12 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The military said on 13 July that 31 rebels had been killed and 170 had been captured in those battles; it said that six of its own soldiers had also been wounded. The Burundian government stated that the rebels had crossed into northern Burundi through the [[Nyungwe Forest]] from [[Rwanda]] but the Rwandan government denied this.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Nzohabona, [https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/burundi-military-31-suspected-rebels-killed-fighting-32417981 &quot;Burundi military: 31 suspected rebels killed in fighting&quot;], Associated Press, 13 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Ngendakumana said that the rebels were from his group.&lt;ref name=Gunmen/&gt;

Shortly after [[Burundian presidential election, 2015|the election]] was held on 21 July, without the participation of the opposition, main opposition leader [[Agathon Rwasa]] proposed the formation of a national unity government, while warning of the potential for more violence and armed rebellion against Nkurunziza. As conditions for participating in such a government, Rwasa said that Nkurunziza's third term would need to be greatly truncated to no more than a year and new elections would have to be held, although he admitted that he doubted Nkurunziza would accept those conditions. He also urged those hoping to oust Nkurunziza through violence to instead focus on dialogue. The government welcomed the idea of forming a national unity government, but rejected the notion of truncating Nkurunziza's new term.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Manirabarusha and Edmund Blair, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/22/us-burundi-politics-opposition-idUSKCN0PW1E020150722 &quot;Burundi opposition leader calls for unity government to avert conflict&quot;], Reuters, 22 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presidential election results were announced on 24 July 2015. Nkurunziza won the election with 69.41% of the vote. [[Agathon Rwasa]] was placed second and credited with 18.99% despite calling for a boycott.&lt;ref name=&quot;ret24&quot;&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/24/us-burundi-election-results-idUSKCN0PY1TN20150724 &quot;Nkurunziza wins third term as Burundi president: electoral commission&quot;], Reuters, 24 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 2018, the government moved Burundi's political capital from [[Bujumbura]] back to [[Gitega]], where it had been until 1966.

'''Anorexia''' is a decreased [[appetite]]. While the term in non-scientific publications is often used interchangeably with [[anorexia nervosa]], many possible causes exist for a decreased appetite, some of which may be harmless, while others indicate a serious clinical condition or pose a significant risk.

Anorexia is a [[symptom]], not a [[diagnosis]]. When a healthcare provider states that a patient has anorexia, they are simply referring to a decreased appetite. This means that the provider must find and treat the underlying cause of the anorexia. Anorexia is not to be confused with the mental health disorder [[anorexia nervosa]]. Because the terms are often used interchangeably, a provider must clarify to a patient to which they are referring as to avoid confusion. Anyone can manifest with anorexia regardless of their gender, age, or weight.

The symptom also occurs in other animals, such as cats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Daniel L.|date=November 1, 2009|title=The Inappetent Hospitalised Cat: Clinical Approach to Maximising Nutritional Support|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=11|issue=11|pages=925–933|doi=10.1016/j.jfms.2009.09.013|pmid=19857855|s2cid=20998698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CatAnorexia&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anorexia|url=https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/anorexia|access-date=July 19, 2020|website=Cornell Feline Health Center|publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Carrozza|first1=Amanda|last2=Marks|first2=Stanley|date=November 20, 2018|title=NY Vet: The Best Approach to Treating Inappetence|url=https://www.americanveterinarian.com/news/ny-vet-the-best-approach-to-treating-inappetence|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719093002/https://www.americanveterinarian.com/news/ny-vet-the-best-approach-to-treating-inappetence|archive-date=July 19, 2020|access-date=July 19, 2020|website=American Veterinarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DogAnorexia&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Llera|first1=Ryan|last2=Downing|first2=Robin|title=Anorexia in Dogs|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/anorexia-in-dogs|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719095051/https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/anorexia-in-dogs|archive-date=July 19, 2020|access-date=July 19, 2020|website=VCA Animal Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt; cattle, goats, and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Jubb|first1=Tristan|last2=Perkins|first2=Nigel|title=Inappetence/Inanition|url=http://www.veterinaryhandbook.com.au/Diseases.aspx?speciesid=&amp;syndromeid=9&amp;diseasenameid=124&amp;id=49|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719094622/http://www.veterinaryhandbook.com.au/Diseases.aspx?speciesid=&amp;syndromeid=9&amp;diseasenameid=124&amp;id=49|archive-date=July 19, 2020|access-date=July 19, 2020|website=Veterinary Handbook for the Livestock Export Industry|publisher=Australian Livestock Export Corporation, Meat &amp; Livestock Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these species, anorexia may be referred to as inappetence.

The term is from {{Lang-grc|ανορεξία}} ({{lang|grc|ἀν-}}, 'without' + {{lang|grc|όρεξις}}, spelled {{transl|grc|órexis}}, meaning 'appetite').&lt;ref name=&quot;Psyhogeos2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Psyhogeos|first=Matina|date=14 April 2016|title=English Words Deriving from the Greek Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CX4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq#v=onepage|editor=Page Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1682134283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common manifestations ==
Anorexia simply manifests as a decreased appetite. This can present as not feeling hungry or lacking the desire to eat. Sometimes people do not even notice they lack an appetite until they begin to lose weight from eating less. In other cases, it can be more noticeable, such as when a person becomes nauseated from just the thought of eating. Any form of decreased appetite that leads to changes in the body (such as weight loss or muscle loss) that is not done intentionally as part of dieting is clinically significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Endocrinology: Adult and Pediatric|last=Jameson|first=Larry|publisher=Saunders|year=2016|isbn=978-0-323-18907-1|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=506–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology of anorexia ==
[[Appetite]] stimulation and suppression is a complex process involving many different parts of the brain and body by the use of various hormones and signals. Appetite is thought to be stimulated by interplay between peripheral signals to the brain (taste, smell, sight, gut hormones) as well as the balance of [[neurotransmitter]]s and [[neuropeptide]]s  in the [[hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Examples of these signals or hormones include [[neuropeptide Y]], [[leptin]], [[Ghrelin|grehlin]], [[insulin]], [[serotonin]], and [[orexin]]s (also called hypocretins). Anything that causes an imbalance of these signals or hormones can lead to the symptom of anorexia. While it is known that these signals and hormones help control appetite, the complicated mechanisms regarding a pathological increase or decrease in appetite are still being explored.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

*[[Tuberculosis]]
*[[Thalassemia]]
*[[Ulcerative colitis]]
*[[Zinc deficiency]]
*[[Infection]] : Anorexia of infection is part of the [[acute phase response]] (APR) to infection. The APR can be triggered by [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[peptidoglycan]]s from bacterial cell walls, bacterial DNA, and double-stranded viral RNA, and viral [[glycoprotein]]s, which can trigger production of a variety of [[proinflammatory cytokines]]. These can have an indirect effect on appetite by a number of means, including [[afferent nerve fiber|peripheral afferent]]s from their sites of production in the body, by enhancing production of [[leptin]] from fat stores. Inflammatory cytokines can also signal to the [[central nervous system]] more directly by specialized transport mechanisms through the [[blood–brain barrier]], via [[circumventricular organ]]s (which are outside the barrier), or by triggering production of [[eicosanoid]]s in the [[endothelial cell]]s of the brain vasculature. Ultimately, the control of appetite by this mechanism is thought to be mediated by the same factors normally controlling [[appetite]], such as neurotransmitters ([[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[corticotropin releasing factor]], [[neuropeptide Y]], and [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Langhans W.|title=Anorexia of infection: current prospects|journal=Nutrition|volume=16|issue=10|pages=996–1005|date=October 2000|pmid=11054606|doi=10.1016/s0899-9007(00)00421-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
*[[Stimulant]]s, such as [[ephedrine]], [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[MDMA]], [[cathinone]], [[methylphenidate]], [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[caffeine]], etc.
*[[Narcotic]]s, such as [[heroin]], [[morphine]], [[codeine]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], etc.
*[[Antidepressants]] can have anorexia as a side effect, primarily [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) such as [[fluoxetine]].
* [[Exenatide|Byetta]], a [[Type 2 diabetes|type II diabetes]] drug, will cause moderate nausea and loss of appetite.
* Abruptly stopping appetite-increasing drugs, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[corticosteroid]]s.
* Chemicals that are members of the [[phenethylamine]] group. (Individuals with anorexia nervosa may seek them to suppress appetite.)
*[[Topiramate]] may cause anorexia as a side effect.
* Other drugs may be used to intentionally cause anorexia in order to help a patient [[fasting|preoperative fasting]] prior to [[general anesthesia]]. It is important to avoid food before surgery to mitigate the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]], which can be fatal.

===Other===
* During the post-operative recovery period for a [[tonsillectomy]] or [[adenoidectomy]], it is common for adult patients to experience a lack of appetite until their throat significantly heals (usually 10–14 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umhc.com/oth/Page.asp?PageID=OTH001009|title=Home Care After Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717153234/www.umhc.com/oth/Page.asp?PageID=OTH001009|archive-date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Altitude sickness]]
* Significant [[Broken heart|emotional pain]] caused by an event (rather than a [[mental disorder]]) can cause an individual to temporarily lose all interest in food.
* [[Psychological stress]]
* Experiencing grotesque or unappealing thoughts or conversations, or viewing similar images
* Being in the presence of unappealing things such as waste matter, dead organisms, or bad smells

==Complications==
Complications of anorexia are related to poor oral intake. Poor food intake can lead to [[dehydration]], severe weight loss, [[electrolyte imbalance]]s, [[anemia]] and [[Malnutrition|nutritional deficiencies]]. These imbalances will worsen the longer that food is avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

===Sudden cardiac death===
Anorexia is a relatively common condition that can lead patients to have dangerous electrolyte imbalances, leading to acquired [[long QT syndrome]] which can result in [[sudden cardiac death]]. This can develop over a prolonged period of time, and the risk is further heightened when feeding resumes after a period of abstaining from consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

=== Refeeding syndrome ===
Care must be taken when a patient begins to eat after prolonged starvation to avoid the potentially fatal complications of [[refeeding syndrome]]. The initial signs of refeeding syndrome are minimal, but can rapidly progress to death. Thus, the reinitiation of food or oral intake is usually started slowly and requires close observation under supervision by trained healthcare professionals. This is usually done in a hospital or nutritional rehabilitation center.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jáuregui-Garrido|first1=B.|last2=Jáuregui-Lobera|first2=I.|title=Sudden death in eating disorders|journal=Vascular Health and Risk Management|date=2012|volume=8|pages=91–98|pmid=22393299|pmc=3292410|doi=10.2147/VHRM.S28652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Anorexia can be treated with the help of [[orexigenic]] drugs.

== &quot;Anorexia&quot; vs &quot;anorexic&quot; vs anorexia nervosa ==
[[Image:Woman_suffering_from_anorexia_nervosa_Wellcome_L0066994.jpg|thumb|160px|Example of severe anorexia leading to an anorexic appearance|alt=]]

Anorexic is a description of somebody with the stereotypical thin, frail, malnourished appearance. The appearance is classically associated with anorexia, although in rare cases do patients end up becoming anorexic. An anorexic or [[anorectic]] is also a description given to substances that cause anorexia for weight loss purposes.

[[Anorexia nervosa]] is an [[eating disorder]] characterized by food restriction due to the strong desire to remain thin. It is considered a mental health diagnosis where people see themselves as overweight regardless of their weight or appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Eating Disorders|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2019-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person does not necessarily exhibit anorexia as a symptom in their quest to restrict food intake.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
She was born 17 November 1966 in Paris, the second child of Simone (née Morisset), a shop assistant (d. 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parismatch.com/People/La-mere-de-Sophie-Marceau-est-decedee-1163480 (retrieved 2017-02-02)&lt;/ref&gt;), and Benoît Maupu, a [[truck driver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;filmref&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/12/Sophie-Marceau.html|title=Sophie Marceau Biography (1966–)|work=Film Reference|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/sophie-marceau-fatal-attraction-850871.html|title=Sophie Marceau: Fatal attraction|work=[[The Independent]]|date=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced when she was nine years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;billen&quot;&gt;Billen, Andrew. &quot;Lies and loves of ma belle Marceau&quot; in ''Sunday Herald'', 10 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
In February 1980, Marceau and her mother came across a model agency looking for teenagers. Marceau had photos taken at the agency, but did not think anything would come of it. At the same time, Françoise Menidrey, the casting director for [[Claude Pinoteau]]'s ''[[La Boum]]'' (1980), asked modeling agencies to recommend a new teenager for the project. After viewing the rushes, Alain Poiré, the director of the [[Gaumont Film Company]], signed Marceau to a long-term contract. ''La Boum'' was a hit movie, not only in France, where 4,378,500 tickets were sold, but also in several other European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdbboxoffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Box office for The Party |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082100/business |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Marceau made her singing debut with French singer François Valéry on record &quot;Dream in Blue&quot;, written by Pierre Delanoë.&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=François Valéry et Sophie Marceau–Dream in Blue |work=Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/Fran%C3%A7ois-Val%C3%A9ry-Et-Sophie-Marceau-Dream-In-Blue/release/3798769 |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected the main role in a soon-to-be controversial film, [[Beau-père]], in which she would have played as a teenage girl who seduces her step-father for a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 March 1983 |title=&quot;Les bonheurs de Sophie Marceau: deux films, 15 millions d'admirateurs et la gloire à 16 ans&quot; |newspaper=[[France-Soir]] |number=11990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was eventually played by [[Ariel Besse]].

In 1982, at age 16, Marceau bought back her contract with Gaumont for one million [[French francs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pallister&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Janis L. Pallister |author2=Ruth A.

After starring in the sequel film ''[[La Boum 2]]'' (1982), Marceau focused on more dramatic roles, including the historical drama ''[[Fort Saganne]]'' in 1984 with [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]], ''Joyeuses Pâques'' (''[[Happy Easter]]'') in 1984, ''[[L'amour braque]]'' and ''[[Police (1985 film)|Police]]'' in 1985, and ''Descente aux enfers'' (''Descent into Hell'') in 1986. In 1988, she starred in ''[[L'Étudiante (film)|L'Étudiante]]'' (''The Student'') and the historical adventure film ''[[Chouans!]]''. That year, Marceau was named Best Romantic Actress at the International Festival of Romantic Movies for her role in ''Chouans!''&lt;ref name=&quot;netglimpse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sophie Marceau |work=Net Glimpse |url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/sophie_marceau/index.shtml |accessdate=1 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117144318/http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/sophie_marceau/index.shtml |archivedate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sophie Marceau Césars 1996.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Marceau at the César Awards, 1996]]
In 1989, Marceau starred in ''[[My Nights Are More Beautiful Than Your Days]]'', which was directed by her long-time boyfriend [[Andrzej Zulawski]]. In 1990, she starred in ''[[Pacific Palisades (film)|Pacific Palisades]]'' and ''La note bleue'', her third film directed by her companion. In 1991, she ventured into the theater in ''[[Eurydice (Anouilh play)|Eurydice]]'', which earned Marceau the [[Moliere Award]] for Best Female Newcomer.&lt;ref name=&quot;netglimpse&quot;/&gt; Throughout the 1990s, Marceau began making less-dramatic films, such as the comedy ''[[Fanfan]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Revenge of the Musketeers]]'' (''La fille de d'Artagnan'') in 1994—both popular in Europe and abroad. That year, she returned to the theatre as Eliza Doolittle in ''Pygmalion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;netglimpse&quot;/&gt;

Marceau achieved international recognition in 1995 playing the role of Princess Isabelle in [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[Braveheart]]''. That year, she was part of an ensemble of international actors in the French film directed by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Wim Wenders]], ''[[Beyond the Clouds (1995 film)|Beyond the Clouds]]''. In 1997, she continued her string of successful films with William Nicholson's ''[[Firelight]]'', filmed in England, Véra Belmont's ''[[Marquise (film)|Marquise]]'', filmed in France, and Bernard Rose's ''[[Anna Karenina (1997 film)|Anna Karenina]]'', filmed in Russia. In 1999, she played Hippolyta in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and the villainess [[Bond girl]] [[Elektra King]] in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''. In 2000, Marceau teamed up again with her then-boyfriend [[Andrzej Zulawski]] to film ''[[Fidelity (2000 film)|Fidelity]]'', playing the role of a talented photographer who takes a job at a scandal-mongering tabloid and becomes romantically involved with an eccentric children's book publisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;netglimpse&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sophie Marceau avp 2013.jpg|thumb|Marceau at the premiere of ''Arrêtez-moi'', 2013]]
In recent years, Marceau has continued to appear in a wide variety of roles, mainly in French films, playing a widowed nurse in ''[[Nelly (2004 film)|Nelly]]'' (''À ce soir'') in 2004, an undercover police agent in ''[[Anthony Zimmer]]'' in 2005, and the troubled daughter of a murdered film star in ''[[Trivial (film)|Trivial]]'' in 2007. In 2008, Marceau played a member of the French Resistance movement in ''[[Female Agents]]'', and a struggling single mother in ''[[LOL (Laughing Out Loud)]]''. In 2009, she teamed up with [[Monica Bellucci]] in ''[[Don't Look Back (2009 film)|Don't Look Back]]'' about the mysterious connection between two women who have never met. In 2010, Marceau played a successful business executive forced to confront her unhappy childhood in ''[[With Love... from the Age of Reason]]'' (''L'âge de raison'').

In 2012, Marceau played a 40-something career woman who falls in love with a young jazz musician in ''[[Happiness Never Comes Alone]]''. In 2013, she appeared in ''[[Arrêtez-moi]]'' (''Arrest Me'') as a woman who shows up at a police station and confesses to the murder of her abusive husband several years earlier.

She was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Main-Jury-Cannes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/61318.html |title=The Jury of the 68th Cannes Film Festival |accessdate=21 April 2015 |work=Cannes Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MainJury&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/jake-gyllenhaal-sienna-miller-and-guillermo-del-toro-join-cannes-film-festival-jury/ |title=Jake Gyllenhaal, Sienna Miller and Guillermo del Toro Join Cannes Film Festival Jury  |accessdate=21 April 2015 |work=The Wrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author and director==
In 1995, Marceau wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, ''Menteuse'' (the English translation, ''Telling Lies'', was published in 2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;telling&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Marceau |first=Sophie |editor=Adriana Hunter |title=Telling Lies |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0753814314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marceau's work was described as &quot;an exploration of female identity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;billen&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, Marceau made her directorial debut in the feature film ''[[Speak to Me of Love]]'', for which she was named Best Director at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]]. The film starred [[Judith Godrèche]]. It was her second directorial effort, following her nine-minute short film ''L'aube à l'envers'' in 1995, which also starred Godrèche.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb-laube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=L'aube à l'envers |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112411/ |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she directed ''Trivial'', her second feature film.

==Personal life==

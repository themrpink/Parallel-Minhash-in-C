In 1963, ''[[Astro Boy]]'' was adapted into a highly influential [[anime]] television series. ''[[Phantom Agents]]'' in 1964 focused on [[ninjas]] working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for [[Sentai]]-type series. 1966 saw the debut of sci-fi/horror series ''[[Ultra Q]]'' created by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] this would eventually lead on to the sequel ''[[Ultraman (1966 TV series)|Ultraman]]'', spawning a [[Ultra Series|successful franchise]] which pioneered the [[Kyodai Hero]] subgenre where the superheroes would be as big as giant monsters (''[[kaiju]]'') that they fought.

The ''kaiju'' monster [[Godzilla]], originally a villain, began being portrayed as a radioactive superhero in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' films]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffington&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-lankes/godzillas-secret-history_b_5192284.html|title=Godzilla's Secret History|last=Lankes|first=Kevin|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=June 22, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grebey |first1=James |title=The history of Ghidorah, Godzilla's rival for the title of King of the Monsters |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-history-of-ghidorah-godzillas-rival-for-the-title-of-king-of-the-monsters |website=[[Syfy Wire]] |publisher=[[NBCUniversal]] |accessdate=27 May 2020 |date=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine ''King of the Monsters'' in 1977 describing Godzilla as &quot;Superhero of the '70s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glut |first1=Donald F. |chapter=Godzilla, Saurian Superhero |title=Jurassic Classics: A Collection of Saurian Essays and Mesozoic Musings |date=2001 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |isbn=978-0-7864-6246-9 |page=225 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5znudeYRzEC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In 1971, ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' launched the &quot;Henshin Boom&quot; on [[Japanese television]] in the early 1970s, greatly impacting the [[tokusatsu]] superhero genre in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Takeshobo|date=1995-11-30 |script-title=ja:超人画報 国産架空ヒーロー四十年の歩み|trans-title=The Super Heroes Chronicles: The History of Japanese Fantastic Televisions, Movies and Videos, 1957-1995 |publisher=[[Takeshobo]] |pages=85|chapter=BonusColumn「変身ブーム到来!!」|trans-chapter=Bonus Column 'The Henshin Boom Arrives!'|id=C0076 |isbn=4-88475-874-9|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the ''[[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman]]'' anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action ''Phantom Agents'' as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' by Go Nagai, creating the [[Super Robot]] genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga ''[[Cutey Honey]]'' in 1973; although the [[Magical Girl]] genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media.

The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s [[Skull Man]] (the basis for his later ''Kamen Rider'') in 1970, Go Nagai's [[Devilman]] in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John Romita's [[Punisher]] in 1974.

The dark [[Skull Man]] manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes. The character was redesigned to resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the [[Kamen Rider]] series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Metamorphosis) to don his costume and gain superhuman powers.

The ideas of [[second-wave feminism]], which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a [[mod (subculture)|mod-dressing]] [[martial artist]] directly inspired by the [[Emma Peel]] character from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television series]] [[The Avengers (TV series)|''The Avengers'']] (no relation to the superhero team of the same name),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We were all in love with Diana Rigg and that show she was on.&quot; Mike Sekowsky, quoted in Les Daniels, ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History'' (Chronicle, 2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; but later reverted to Marston's original concept after the editors of [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms. magazine]] publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional costume;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_twenty-four_/matsuuchi.pdf Wonder Woman Wears Pants: ''Wonder Woman'', Feminism and the 1972 “Women’s Lib” Issue], by [http://Ann%20Matsuuchi Ann Matsuuchi]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''Colloquy: text theory critique'', no.24 (2012); archived at [[Monash University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on ''[[Action Comics]]'' to headline ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' in 1969; the [[Lady Liberators]] appeared in an issue of ''The Avengers'' as a group of mind-controlled superheroines led by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] (actually a [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|disguised supervillainess]]) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= W.

Both major publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development. Examples include [[Big Barda]], [[Power Girl]], and [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]] by DC comics; and from Marvel, the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|second Black Widow]], [[Shanna the She-Devil]], and [[Tigra#The Cat|The Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 1970): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; Female [[supporting character]]s who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late 1950s onward: [[Hal Jordan]]'s love interest [[Carol Ferris]] was introduced as the Vice-President of [[Ferris Aircraft]] and later took over the company from her father; [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], who was first introduced in the ''Fantastic Four'' series, is a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman Royal Family]] and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal society; and [[Carol Danvers]], a decorated [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[United States Air Force]] who would become a costumed superhero herself years later.

In 1975 [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s ''[[Himitsu Sentai Gorenger]]'' debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action, and began the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' franchise (later adapted into the American ''[[Power Rangers]]'' series in the 1990s). In 1978, Toei adapted [[Spider-Man]] into [[Spider-Man (Japanese TV series)|a live-action Japanese television series]]. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's [[Battle Fever J]] (also co-produced with Marvel) and now multi-colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with.

===1980-present===
In subsequent decades, popular characters like [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Catwoman]], [[Witchblade]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], [[Batgirl]] and [[Birds of Prey (comics)|the Birds of Prey]] became stars of long-running eponymous titles.

Critics in the legal community dispute whether the &quot;Super Hero&quot; marks meet the legal standard for trademark protection in the United States: distinctive designation of a single source of a product or service. Controversy exists over each element of that standard: whether &quot;Super Hero&quot; is distinctive rather than generic, whether &quot;Super Hero&quot; designates a source of products or services, and whether DC and Marvel jointly represent a single source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/?p=413 | last=Coleman| first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Coleman (legal scholar)|publisher= Likelihood of Confusion| title=SUPER HERO® my foot| date= March 27, 2006 | archive-date= July 22, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722133516/http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/super-hero-my-foot/ | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics further characterize the marks as a misuse of trademark law to chill competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/18/marvel-comics-steali.html | last=Doctorow| first=Cory| authorlink=Cory Doctorow| publisher= [[Boing Boing]]| title= Marvel Comics: stealing our language| date= March 18, 2006 | archive-date= August 18, 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140818085048/http://boingboing.net/2006/03/18/marvel-comics-steali.html| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, aside from a failed trademark removal action brought in 2016 against DC Comics' and Marvel Comics' United Kingdom registration,  no dispute involving the trademark &quot;Super Hero&quot; has ever been to trial or hearing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;/&gt;

===Female superheroes and villains===

{{Main|Portrayal of women in American comics}}

Female super heroes—and villains—have been around since the early years of comic books dating back to the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Comic Book Lecture Moore, Dr. Eric. 2019. TAMUCC.&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of women in comic books has been questioned in the past decade following the rise of comic book characters in the film industry (Marvel/ DC movies).

Villains, such as [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], use their sexuality to take advantage of their male victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery-Natale&quot; /&gt; In the film versions of these characters, their sexuality and seductive methods are highlighted. Poison Ivy uses seduction through poison to take over the minds of her victims as seen in the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''. Harley Quinn in 2016's ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' uses her sexuality to her advantage, acting in a promiscuous manner.

Through the overdeveloped bodies of the heroes or the seductive mannerisms of the villains, women in comic books are used as subordinates to their male counterparts, regardless of their strength or power.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Alexandra. 2015. &quot;The Female Superhero: Fighting Villains and Stereotypes.&quot; ''A Publication of the Critical Writing Program the University of Pennsylvania 3808 Walnut Street Philadelphia, PA 19104-6221'':18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017's ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', she had the power of a god, but was still drawn to a much weaker, mortal male character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade, Lisa Professor&quot; /&gt; This can be explained by the sociological concept &quot;feminine apologetic,&quot; which reinforces a woman's femininity to account for her masculine attributes (strength, individualism, toughness, aggressiveness, bravery).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade, Lisa Professor&quot; /&gt; Women in comic books are considered to be misrepresented due to being created by men, for men.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMAD 954–984&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawshaw, Trisha L 2015&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[African-American]] superhero, the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], followed in 1969, and three years later, [[Luke Cage]], a self-styled [[Heroes for Hire|&quot;hero-for-hire&quot;]], became the first [[list of black superheroes|black superhero]] to star in [[Power Man and Iron Fist|his own series]]. In 1989, the [[Monica Rambeau]] [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)#Monica Rambeau|incarnation of Captain Marvel]] was the first female black superhero from a major publisher to get her own title in a special one-shot issue. In 1971, [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] became the first [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] in the superheroic tradition to headline a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redwf2.htm |title=Red Wolf (Old West, Johnny Wakely) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[Shang-Chi]] became the first prominent [[List of Asian superheroes|Asian superhero]] to star in an American comic book ([[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] had been a secondary character of the ''[[Green Hornet]]'' media franchise series since its inception in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-kim/rethink-review-the-green-_b_809097.html?ir=Australia| title= Why The Green Hornet's Kato Matters | authorlink= Jonathan Kim| first= Jonathan| last= Kim | work= The Huffington Post| date = January 15, 2011| accessdate = August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Kitty Pryde]], a member of the X-Men, was an openly Jewish superhero in mainstream American comic books as early as 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8aH3H7DC6BQC&amp;q=first+jewish+superhero+kitty+pryde&amp;pg=PA120| title= From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and Comic Books | authorlink= Arie Kaplan| first= Arie | last= Kaplan | publisher= The Jewish Publication Society| year=2008| isbn=978-0827608436 | page=120 | quote=In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129 [[cover-date]]d Jan. 1979 and on sale in late 1978, writer [[Chris Claremont]] and the artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] created Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Pryde, aka Shadowcat, a young Jewish girl who possess the mutant ability to walk through walls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic-book companies were in the early stages of cultural expansion and many of these characters played to specific [[stereotype]]s; Cage and many of his contemporaries often employed lingo similar to that of [[blaxploitation]] films, Native Americans were often associated with [[shamanism]] and [[Totemism|wild animals]], and [[Asian American]]s were often portrayed as [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu martial artist]]s. Subsequent minority heroes, such as the [[X-Men]]'s [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Teen Titans]]' [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] avoided such conventions; they were both part of ensemble teams, which became increasingly diverse in subsequent years. The X-Men, in particular, were revived in 1975 with a line-up of characters drawn from several nations, including the [[Kenya]]n Storm, [[Germany|German]] [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/[[Russians|Russian]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Japan]]ese [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]. In 1993, [[Milestone Comics]], an African-American-owned media/publishing company entered into a publishing agreement with DC Comics that allowed them to introduce a line of comics that included characters of many ethnic minorities. Milestone's initial run lasted four years, during which it introduced ''[[Static (superhero)|Static]],'' a character adapted into the [[WB Television Network|WB Network]] [[animated series]] ''[[Static Shock]]''.

In addition to the creation of new minority heroes, publishers have filled the identities and roles of once-Caucasian heroes with new characters from minority backgrounds. The African-American [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] appeared in the 1970s as an alternate for Earth's Green Lantern [[Hal Jordan]], and would become a regular member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] from the 1980s onward. The creators of the 2000s-era [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'' animated series]] selected Stewart as the show's Green Lantern. In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], a youth of [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] and African-American ancestry who was also bitten by a genetically-altered spider, debuted as [[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man|the new Spider-Man]] after the [[List of Ultimate Spider-Man story arcs#Death of Spider-Man (#156-160)|apparent death]] of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|the original Spider-Man, Peter Parker]]. [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Kamala Khan]], a [[Pakistani-American]] [[Islam|Muslim]] teenager who is revealed to have [[Inhumans|Inhuman lineage]] after her [[shapeshifting]] powers manifested, takes on the identity of [[Ms. Marvel]] in 2014 after [[Carol Danvers]] had become Captain Marvel. Her self-titled comic book series became a cultural phenomenon, with extensive media coverage by [[CNN]], the [[New York Times]] and [[The Colbert Report]], and embraced by anti-[[Islamophobia]] campaigners in [[San Francisco]] who plastered over anti-Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/25/feminist-superheroes-she-hulk-ms-marvel-thor | work= [[The Guardian]] | location = UK | title=Kapow!

Certain established characters have had their ethnicity changed when adapted to another continuity or media. A notable example is [[Nick Fury]], who is reinterpreted as [[Ultimate Nick Fury|African-American]] both in the Ultimate Marvel as well as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] continuities.

===Sexual orientation and gender identity===

In 1992, Marvel [[the closet|revealed]] that [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], a member of the [[Canada|Canadian]] mutant superhero team [[Alpha Flight]], was [[homosexuality|homosexual]], after years of implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anton|last=Kawasaki |url=http://www.gayleague.com/wordpress/northstar/ |title=Northstar – GAY LEAGUE |publisher=Gayleague.com |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended a long-standing editorial mandate that there would be no homosexual characters in Marvel comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hick|first1=Darren|title=The Comics Journal Performs a Public Service|url=http://www.tcj.com/3_online/f_nuremburg.html|website=The Comics Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005234302/http://www.tcj.com/3_online/f_nuremburg.html|archivedate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some minor secondary characters in [[DC Comics]]' mature-audience 1980s miniseries ''[[Watchmen]]'' were gay, and the reformed supervillain [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] [[coming out|came out]] to [[Wally West]] in an issue of ''[[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 2 (1987–2006, 2007-08)|The Flash]]'' in 1991, Northstar is considered to be the first openly gay superhero appearing in mainstream comic books. From the mid-2000s onward, several established Marvel and DC comics characters (or a variant version of the pre-existing character) were outed or reintroduced as LGBT individuals by both publishers. Examples include the [[Mikaal Tomas|Mikaal Tomas incarnation of Starman]] in 1998; [[Alternative versions of Colossus#Ultimate Marvel|Colossus]] in the [[Ultimate X-Men]] series; [[Renee Montoya]] in DC's ''[[Gotham Central]]'' series in 2003; the [[Batwoman#Kate Kane|Kate Kane incarnation of Batwoman]] in 2006; [[Rictor]] and [[Shatterstar]] in an issue of [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] in 2009; the Golden Age Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] is reimagined as openly gay following [[The New 52]] reboot in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5030518.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Batwoman hero returns as lesbian |work=BBC News |date=May 30, 2006 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Neuman |first=Clayton |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1200745,00.html |title=Caped Crusaders |magazine=TIME |date=June 4, 2006 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015, a younger time displaced version of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] in an issue of ''[[All-New X-Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanks |first=Henry |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/21/entertainment/ice-man-gay-feat-xmen/ |title='X-Men' character Iceman outed as gay |publisher=CNN.com |date=April 22, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new openly gay, lesbian and bisexual characters have since emerged in superhero fiction, such as [[Gen¹³]]'s [[Sarah Rainmaker|Rainmaker]], [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]] and [[Midnighter]] of [[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]], and [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Hulkling]] of the [[Young Avengers]]. Notable [[transgender]] or [[gender bending]] characters are fewer in number by comparison: the alter ego of superheroine [[Zsazsa Zaturnnah]], a seminal character in Philippine popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/32539/the-return-of-zsazsa-zaturnnah |title=The return of Zsazsa Zaturnnah &amp;#124; Inquirer lifestyle |publisher=Lifestyle.inquirer.net |date= January 27, 2012|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an effeminate gay man who transforms into a female superhuman after ingesting a magical stone. [[Desire (DC Comics)|Desire]] from [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''The Sandman'']] series, Cloud from [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], and [[Xavin]] from the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] are all characters who could (and often) change their gender at will. [[Alysia Yeoh]], a supporting character created by writer [[Gail Simone]] for the [[Batgirl]] ongoing series published by DC Comics, received substantial media attention in 2011 for being the first major transgender character written in a contemporary context in a mainstream American comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Matt |url=https://www.glaad.org/blog/batgirl-comic-introduces-transgender-character |title='Batgirl' Comic Introduces Transgender Character |publisher=GLAAD |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sailor Moon'' series is known for featuring a substantial number of openly [[LGBT]] characters since its inception, as [[Japan]] have traditionally been more open about portraying homosexuality in its children's media compared to many countries in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue3/mclelland2.html |title=Intersections: Male Homosexuality and Popular Culture in Modern Japan |publisher=She.murdoch.edu.au |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040923091132/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2003_Oct_14/ai_110809191 Anime, mon amour: Forget Pokemon - Japanese animation explodes with gay, lesbian, and trans themes - video] - Charles Solomon&lt;/ref&gt; Certain characters who are presented as homosexual or transgender in one continuity may not be presented as such in others, particularly with dubbed versions made for international release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sara-ronceromenendez/kissing-cousins-viz-wont-_b_5353859.html?ir=Australia | work=Huffington Post | title=Sailor Neptune and Uranus Come Out of the Fictional Closet | date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An animated short ''[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]'' parodies comic book superheros and features Ace and Gary (Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell). It originated on ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' and then moved to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

== History ==

Interleaf was founded by David Boucher and Harry George in 1981. Boucher served as chief executive officer from 1981 until 1992; George served as chief financial officer. Earlier, both were among the founders of [[Ray Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]]. Other early personnel came from NBI and [[Wang Labs]]. The company initially produced &quot;turnkey&quot; systems, that is, combinations of hardware and software integrated by the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitz Simon&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Interleaf released its first product in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitz Simon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Xerox Star]] and [[Apple Lisa]], TPS (Technical Publishing Software) uniquely enabled authors to write their text and create technical graphics on a computer screen that showed what the page would look like when formatted and printed on a [[laser printer]]. Although modern word processors routinely allow that, at the time this capability was so unusual that the company's name referred to the &quot;interleaving&quot; of text and graphics. TPS was also noted for its ability to handle the sorts of long documents corporate technical publishing departments routinely created.

Interleaf had its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in June 1986, raising $24.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

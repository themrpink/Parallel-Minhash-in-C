'''Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|t|iː|s|t|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/batista &quot;Batista&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|fulˈxensjo βaˈtista i salˈdiβaɾ|lang}}; born '''Rubén Zaldívar''',&lt;ref name=&quot;ruben&quot;/&gt; January 16, 1901 – August 6, 1973) was a Cuban military officer and politician who served as the elected [[President of Cuba]] from 1940 to 1944 and as its U.S.-backed [[Dictator|military dictator]] from 1952 to 1959, before being overthrown during the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Batista initially rose to power as part of the [[Sergeants' Revolt|1933 Revolt of the Sergeants]], which overthrew the provisional government of [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]]. He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of [[colonel]] and effectively controlled the [[Pentarchy of 1933|five-member &quot;pentarchy&quot;]] that functioned as the collective head of state. He maintained this control through a string of [[Puppet state|puppet]] presidents until 1940, when he was himself elected President of Cuba on a [[populism|populist]] platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;libraries.ucsd.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/cuba/elections-and-events-19351951.html |title=Elections and Events 1935-1951 – The Library |publisher=Libraries.ucsd.edu |access-date=August 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112150705/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/cuba/elections-and-events-19351951.html |archive-date=January 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fulgencio Batista|volume=1|page=[https://archive.org/details/fulgenciobatista00argo/page/50 50]|last=Argote-Freyre|first=Frank|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8135-3701-6|url=https://archive.org/details/fulgenciobatista00argo/page/50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then instated the [[1940 Constitution of Cuba]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Place in the Sun: Canada and Cuba in the Castro Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwY1yvfHs_IC&amp;pg=PA8|isbn=978-0-8020-9666-1|year=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|page=8|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Wright|editor2-first=Lana|editor2-last=Wylie|access-date=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served until 1944. After finishing his term, Batista moved to [[Florida]], returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a [[1952 Cuban coup d'état|military coup]] against President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] that pre-empted the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cavendish (occult writer) |title=General Batista Returns to Power in Cuba |url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/general-batista-returns-power-cuba |magazine=[[History Today]] |location=London |publisher=History Today Ltd |date=March 2002 |volume=52 |issue=3 |access-date=September 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest [[sugar plantation]]s, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dictionary1950&quot;&gt;''Historical Dictionary of the 1950s'', by [[James S.

These murders mounted in 1957, as [[socialism|socialist ideas]] became more influential. Many people were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to about 20,000 people killed. &lt;ref name=&quot;CIA, 1963 P. 1&quot;&gt;CIA (1963).

Catalyzing the resistance to such tactics, for two years (December 1956 – December 1958) [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[26th of July Movement]] and other [[communist]] rebelling elements led an urban- and rural-based [[guerrilla]] uprising against Batista's government, which culminated in his eventual defeat by rebels under the command of [[Che Guevara]] at the [[Battle of Santa Clara]] on New Year's Day 1959. Batista immediately fled the island with an amassed personal fortune to the [[Dominican Republic]], where [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] and previous military ally [[Rafael Trujillo]] held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in [[Oliveira Salazar]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], where he first lived on America of [[Madeira]] and then in [[Estoril]], outside [[Lisbon]]. He was involved in business activities in [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and was staying there in Guadalmina near [[Marbella]] at the time of his death from a heart attack on August 6, 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Batista Dies in Spain at 72 |date=August 7, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Fulgencio Batista, president of Cuba.jpg|left|thumb|A young Batista]]

Batista was born in the town of Veguita, located in the municipality of [[Banes, Cuba|Banes]], province of [[Holguín Province|Holguín]], Cuba, in 1901, to Belisario Batista Palermo&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubagen.org/mil/mambi/ &quot;Mambí Army&quot; Data Base].&lt;/ref&gt; and Carmela Zaldívar González, who had fought in the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. He was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Afro-Cubans|African]], [[Taíno]] and [[Chinese Cubans|Chinese]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/batista.htm |title=Fulgencio Batista, from army sergeant to dictator |first=Jerry A. |last=Sierra |website=www.historyofcuba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Havana By Brendan Sainsbury [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nts8mp9megcC&amp;pg=PA91].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XkJqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Batista+fulgencio+indian+spanish+chinese&amp;dq=Batista+fulgencio+indian+spanish+chinese Fidel Castro's Road to Power, Volume 1].&lt;/ref&gt; His mother named him Rubén and gave him her last name, Zaldívar. His father did not want to register him as a Batista. In the registration records of the Banes courthouse, he was legally Rubén Zaldívar until 1939, when, as Fulgencio Batista, he became a presidential candidate and it was discovered that this name did not exist in the [[birth certificate]]s; he thus had to postpone the presentation of his candidacy and pay 15,000 [[cuban peso|pesos]] to the local judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruben&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cino |first=Luis |date=March 13, 2006 |title=Rubén el terrible |trans-title=Rubén the terrible |url=http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y06/mar06/13a7.htm |work=Cubanet |location=Coral Gables, FL |publisher=CubaNet News, Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130020940/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y06/mar06/13a7.htm |archive-date=November 30, 2007 |access-date=September 30, 2017 |quote=En las actas del juzgado de Banes siguió siendo legalmente Rubén Zaldívar hasta que en 1939, al ser nominado a la candidatura presidencial, se descubrió que la inscripción de nacimiento de Fulgencio Batista no existía.

In 1933, Batista led an uprising called the [[Sergeants' Revolt]], as part of the coup that overthrew the government of [[Gerardo Machado]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSBatista&quot;&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_batista.html American Experience: Fulgencio Batista] by ''PBS''.&lt;/ref&gt; Machado was succeeded by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]], who lacked a political coalition that could sustain him and was soon replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;images.library.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933.

A short-lived five-member presidency, known as the [[Pentarchy of 1933]], was established. The Pentarchy included a representative from each anti-Machado faction. Batista was not a member, but controlled Cuba's armed forces. Within days, the representative for the students and professors of the [[University of Havana]], [[Ramón Grau San Martín]], was made president—and Batista became the Army Chief of Staff, with the rank of colonel, effectively putting him in control of the presidency.&lt;ref name=Argote1&gt;Frank Argote-Freyre.

Grau remained president for just over [[One Hundred Days Government|100 days]] before Batista, conspiring with the U.S. envoy [[Sumner Welles]], forced him to resign in January 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSBatista&quot;/&gt; Grau was replaced by [[Carlos Mendieta]], and within five days the U.S. recognized Cuba's new government, which lasted eleven months. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was elected president in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSBatista&quot;/&gt; After Mendieta, succeeding governments were led by [[José Agripino Barnet]] (5 months) and [[Miguel Mariano Gómez]] (7 months) before [[Federico Laredo Brú]] ruled from December 1936 to October 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;images.library.wisc.edu&quot;/&gt;

Cuba entered World War II on the side of the Allies on December 9, 1941, declaring war on Japan two days after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. On December 11, the Batista government declared war on Germany and Italy. In December 1942, after a friendly visit to Washington, Batista said Latin America would applaud a decision by the [[Declaration by United Nations|United Nations]] to go to war with [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Spanish State|Spain]], calling the regime &quot;fascist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886090,00.html &quot;Plain Talk in Spanish&quot;], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', December 28, 1942, Retrieved March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html &quot;Batista's Boost&quot;], ''Time'', January 18, 1943, Retrieved March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
In 1944, Batista's handpicked successor, [[Carlos Saladrigas Zayas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuba/voting-ballot.jpg|title=See}}&lt;/ref&gt; was defeated by Grau. In the final months of his presidency, Batista sought to handicap the incoming Grau administration. In a July 17, 1944, dispatch to the U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador [[Spruille Braden]] wrote: 

{{quote|It is becoming increasingly apparent that President Batista intends to discomfit the incoming Administration in every way possible, particularly financially. A systematic raid on the Treasury is in full swing with the result that Dr. Grau will probably find empty coffers when he takes office on October 10. It is blatant that President Batista desires that Dr. Grau San Martin should assume obligations which in fairness and equity should be a matter of settlement by the present Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Foreign relations of the United States : diplomatic papers, 1944|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1944v07.p0924&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1944v07&amp;isize=L&amp;q1=grau%20san%20martin|last=United States Department of State|author-link=United States Department of State|year=1944|work=The American Republics|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]] Digital Collections|page=910|volume=VII|access-date=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly after his successor was inaugurated, Batista left Cuba for the United States. &quot;I just felt safer there,&quot; he said. He divorced his wife, Elisa, and married Marta Fernández Batista in 1945. Two of their four children were born in the United States.

For the next eight years, Batista remained in the background, spending time in the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York City and a home in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSBatista&quot;/&gt;

He continued to participate in Cuban politics, and was elected to the Cuban Senate ''in absentia'' in 1948. Returning to Cuba, he decided to run for president and received permission from President Grau, whereupon he formed the United Action Party. On taking power he founded the Progressive Action Party, but he never regained his former popular support, though the unions supported him until the end.&lt;ref name=aboutcom&gt;[http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/historyofthecaribbean/a/08fbatista.htm Biography of Fulgencio Batista—Fulgencio Batista Profile] About.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/lang/batista ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Batista again ran for president. In a three-way race, [[Roberto Agramonte]] of the [[Partido Ortodoxo|Orthodox Party]] led in all the polls, followed by [[Carlos Hevia]] of the [[Partido Auténtico|Authentic Party]].

On March 10, 1952, three months before the elections, Batista, with army backing, [[1952 Cuban coup d'état|staged a coup and seized power]]. He ousted outgoing President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], canceled the elections and took control of the government as a provisional president. The United States recognized his government on March 27.&lt;ref&gt;This date is given in many sources although there is none that seemed to be clearly definitive. The closest is a recommendation from US Secretary of State Dean Acheson to President Truman on March 24 recommending recognition on that date:  {{cite web|last1=Acheson|first1=Dean|title=Continuation of Diplomatic Relations with Cuba|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v04/d327|website=Office of the Historian of the United States Department of State|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=March 9, 2017|date=March 24, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by the U.S. government to analyze Batista's Cuba, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] said 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The corruption of the Government, the brutality of the police, the government's indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic justice&amp;nbsp;... is an open invitation to revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dynamics of World Power: A Documentary History of the United States Foreign Policy 1945-1973'', by [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], 1973, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070797293}}, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Economy of Cuba===
Upon his seizure of power, Batista inherited a country that was relatively prosperous for Latin America. According to Batista's government, although a third of Cubans still lived in poverty, Cuba was one of the five most developed countries in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Cuban revolution at 50: Heroic myth and prosaic failure|date=December 30, 2008|newspaper=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12851254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Cuba's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was roughly equal to that of Italy at the time, although Cuba's per-capita GDP was still only a sixth of that of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Fidel Castro|author=Servando Gonzalez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although corruption and inequality were rife under Batista, Cuban industrial workers' wages rose significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzalez&quot;/&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], the average industrial salary in Cuba was the world's eighth-highest in 1958, and the average agricultural wage was higher than some European nations. However, despite an array of positive indicators, in 1953, the average Cuban family only had an income of $6.00 a week, 15% to 20% of the labor force was chronically unemployed, and only a third of the homes had running water.&lt;ref name = &quot;JFK1960&quot;&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25660 Remarks of Senator John F.

===Relationship with organized crime===
{{quote|[[Brothels]] flourished. A major industry grew up around them; government officials received bribes, policemen collected protection money. Prostitutes could be seen standing in doorways, strolling the streets, or leaning from windows. One report estimated that 11,500 of them worked their trade in Havana.

Throughout the 1950s, Havana served as &quot;a hedonistic playground for the world's elite&quot;, producing sizable gambling, prostitution and drug profits for the [[American mafia]], corrupt law-enforcement officials, and their politically elected [[Cronyism|cronies]].&lt;ref name = &quot;CubanH&quot;&gt;[http://www.thecubanhistory.com/2012/05/william-morgan-a-rebel-americano-in-cuba/ William Morgan: A Rebel &quot;Americano&quot; in Cuba] at ''The Cuban History'', May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of the Cuban-American historian Louis Perez, &quot;Havana was then what [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] has become.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot; Smithson&quot;/&gt; Relatedly, it is estimated that by the end of the 1950s the city of Havana had 270 brothels.&lt;ref name=&quot;CubaBefore&quot;&gt;[http://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/cuban-revolution-fidel-castro-casinos-batista/ Cuba Before the Revolution] by [[Samuel Farber]], [[Jacobin (magazine)|''Jacobin Magazine'']], September 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, drugs, be it [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] or [[cocaine]], were so plentiful at the time that one American magazine in 1950 proclaimed &quot;Narcotics are hardly more difficult to obtain in Cuba than a shot of [[rum]]. And only slightly more expensive.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;CubanH&quot; /&gt; As a result, the playwright [[Arthur Miller]] described Batista's Cuba in ''[[The Nation]]'' as &quot;hopelessly corrupt, a Mafia playground, (and) a bordello for Americans and other foreigners.

In a bid to profit from such an environment, Batista established lasting relationships with [[organized crime]], notably with American mobsters [[Meyer Lansky]] and [[Lucky Luciano]], and under his rule Havana became known as &quot;the Latin [[Las Vegas history#1947–1963: postwar boom and organized crime|Las Vegas]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistCuba&quot;&gt;[http://historyofcuba.com/history/funfacts/batist.htm Fulgencio Batista] fun facts by ''History of Cuba''.&lt;/ref&gt; Batista and Lansky formed a friendship and business relationship that flourished for a decade. During a stay at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York in the late 1940s, it was mutually agreed that, in return for kickbacks, Batista would give Lansky and the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] control of Havana's racetracks and casinos.&lt;ref&gt;''Havana Nocturne: How the Mob Owned Cuba and Then Lost It to the Revolution'', by [[T. J. English]], William Morrow, 2008, {{ISBN|0-06-114771-0}}, p. 15, 16, 20&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, Luciano was paroled from prison on the condition that he permanently return to [[Sicily]]. Luciano secretly moved to Cuba, where he worked to resume control over American Mafia operations. Luciano also ran a number of casinos in Cuba with the sanction of Batista, though the American government eventually succeeded in pressuring the Batista government to deport him.&lt;ref&gt;''Havana Nocturne: How the Mob Owned Cuba and Then Lost It to the Revolution'', by [[T. J. English]], William Morrow, 2008, {{ISBN|0-06-114771-0}}, p. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Batista encouraged large-scale gambling in Havana. In 1955, he announced that Cuba would grant a gaming license to anyone who invested US$1&amp;nbsp;million in a hotel or $200,000 in a new nightclub—and that the government would provide matching public funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption, and waive duties on imported equipment and furnishings for new hotels. Each casino would pay the government $250,000 for the license, plus a percentage of the profits. The policy omitted background checks, as required for casino operations in the United States, which opened the door for casino investors with illegally obtained funds. Cuban contractors with the right connections made windfalls by importing, duty-free, more materials than needed for new hotels and selling the surplus to others. It was rumored that, besides the $250,000 to obtain a license, an additional &quot;under the table&quot; fee was sometimes required.&lt;ref&gt;''Havana Nocturne: How the Mob Owned Cuba and Then Lost It to the Revolution'', by [[T. J. English]], William Morrow, 2008, {{ISBN|0-06-114771-0}}, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lansky became a prominent figure in Cuba's gambling operations,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSBatista&quot;/&gt; and exerted influence over Batista's casino policies. The Mafia's [[Havana Conference]] was held on December 22, 1946, at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba]]; this was the first full-scale meeting of American underworld leaders since the Chicago meeting in 1932. Lansky set about cleaning up the games at the Montmartre Club, which soon became the &quot;place to be&quot; in Havana. He also wanted to open a casino in the Hotel Nacional, the most elegant hotel in Havana. Batista endorsed Lansky's idea over the objections of American [[expatriate]]s such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the renovated casino wing opened for business in 1955 with a show by [[Eartha Kitt]]. The casino was an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&amp;artID=222 Cuban History, Architecture &amp; Culture].&lt;/ref&gt;

As the new hotels, nightclubs, and casinos opened, Batista collected his share of the profits. Nightly, the &quot;bagman&quot; for his wife collected 10% of the profits at [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante's]] casinos, the Sans Souci cabaret, and the casinos in the hotels Sevilla-Biltmore, Commodoro, Deauville, and Capri (partly owned by the actor [[George Raft]]). His take from the Lansky casinos—his prized [[Hotel Habana Riviera|Habana Riviera]], the Hotel Nacional, the Montmartre Club, and others—was said to be 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1768.html Fulgencio Batista: Cuban Dictator, 1901–1973] at U-S History.&lt;/ref&gt; Lansky was said to have personally contributed millions of dollars per year to Batista's Swiss bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Díaz-Briquets, Sergio &amp; Pérez-López, Jorge F.|title=Corruption in Cuba: Castro and beyond|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-71482-3|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fiquofr8LSoC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

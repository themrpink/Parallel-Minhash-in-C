===Hares ===
{{main|Hare}}[[File:Bushhase.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scrub hare]] in South Africa]]
Hares, members of genus ''[[Lepus]]'' of family Leporidae, are medium size mammals native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. North American [[jackrabbit]]s are actually hares. Species vary in size from {{cvt|40|to|70|cm|0}} in length and have long powerful back legs, and ears up to {{cvt|20|cm|0}} in length. Although usually greyish-brown, some species turn white in winter. They are solitary animals and several litters of young are born during the year in a form, a hollow in the ground amongst dense vegetation. The young are born fully furred and active. They are preyed upon by large mammalian carnivores and birds of prey.&lt;ref name=Britanniahare&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.britannica.com/animal/hare-mammal |title=Hare |author=Smith, Andrew T. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2020-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbits ===
{{main|Rabbit}}
Rabbits, members of family Leporidae outside ''Lepus'', are generally much smaller than hares and include the [[Red rock hare|rock hares]] and the [[hispid hare]]. They are native to Europe, parts of Africa, Central and Southern Asia, North America and much of South America. They inhabit both grassland and arid regions. They vary in size from {{cvt|20|to|50|cm|0}} and have long, powerful hind legs, shorter forelegs and a tiny tail. The colour is some shade of brown, buff or grey and there is one black species and two striped ones. Domesticated rabbits come in a wider variety of colours. Newborn rabbits are less developed than hares and require parental care. Although most species live and breed in burrows, the cottontails and hispid hares have forms (nests). Most of the burrowing species are colonial, and may feed together in small groups. Rabbits play an important part in the terrestrial [[food chain]], eating a wide range of [[forb]]s, grasses, and herbs, and being part of the staple diet of many carnivorous species. Many breeds of rabbit can be litter-trained, and—assuming they are given sufficient room to run—can live happy lives as house pets.

==Distribution==
Lagomorphs are widespread around the world and inhabit every continent except Antarctica. However, they are not found in most of the southern cone of South America, in the West Indies, Indonesia or Madagascar, nor on many islands. Although they are not native to Australia, humans have introduced them there and they have successfully colonized many parts of the country and caused disruption to native species.&lt;ref name=aboutcom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.about.com/od/lagomorphs/p/hares-rabbits-pikas.htm |title=Hares, Rabbits and Pikas |author=Klappenbach, Laura |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
=== Digestion ===
[[File:Alaskan Hare Skeleton.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of Alaskan Hare ([[Museum of Osteology]])]]
Like other herbivores, lagomorphs have to deal with a bulky diet in which the cell walls are composed of [[cellulose]], a substance which mammalian digestive enzymes are unable to break down. Despite this, lagomorphs have developed a way of extracting maximum nourishment from their diet. First they bite off and shred plant tissues with their incisors and then they grind the material with their molars. Digestion continues in the stomach and small intestine where nutrients are absorbed. After that, certain food remains get diverted into the [[caecum]], a blind-ended pouch. Here, they are mixed with bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms that are able to digest cellulose and turn it into sugar, a process known as [[hindgut fermentation]]. Other faecal matter passes along the colon and is excreted in the normal way as small, dry pellets. About four to eight hours after the meal, the contents of the caecum pass into the colon and are eliminated as soft, moist pellets known as [[cecotrope]]s. These are immediately eaten by the lagomorph, which can thus extract all the remaining nutrients in the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/exploring-a-rabbits-unique-digestive-system.html |title=Exploring a Rabbit's Unique Digestive System |work=Rabbits for Dummies |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth and early life ===
Many lagomorphs breed several times a year and produce large litters. This is particularly the case in species that breed in underground, protective environments such as burrows. The [[altricial]] young of rabbits, called kittens, are born naked and helpless after a short gestation period and the mother can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth. The mothers are able to leave these young safely and go off to feed, returning at intervals to feed them with their unusually rich milk. In some species, the mother only visits and feeds the litter once a day but the young grow rapidly and are usually weaned within a month. Hares live above ground and their litters, containing leverets, are born in &quot;forms&quot; concealed among tussocks and scrub. They have a strategy to prevent predators from tracking down their litter by following the adults' scent. They approach and depart from the nesting site in a series of immense bounds, sometimes moving at right angles to their previous direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Observer's Book of British Wild Animals |last=Burton |first=Maurice |year=1971 |publisher=Frederick Warne &amp; Co. |isbn=9780723215035 |pages=109–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young are [[precocial]] and a small number are born after a longer gestation period, already clad in short fur and able to move around.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannialagomorph&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/lagomorph |title=Lagomorph |author=Smith, Andrew T. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2020-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociality and safety ===
Many species of lagomorphs, particularly the rabbits and the pikas, are gregarious and live in colonies, whereas hares are generally solitary species, although many hares travel and forage in groups of two, three, or four. The rabbits and pikas rely on their holes as places of safety when danger threatens, but hares rely on their long legs, great speed and jinking gait to escape from predators.

'''Columbia''' is a [[census-designated place]] in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]], [[Maryland]], United States, and is one of the principal communities of the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]]. It is a [[planned community]] consisting of 10 self-contained villages.

Columbia began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' [[quality of life]]. Creator and developer [[James W. Rouse]] saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering.

Columbia proper consists only of that territory governed by the [[Columbia Association]], but larger areas are included under its name by the U.S. Postal Service and the Census Bureau. These include several other communities which predate Columbia, including [[Simpsonville, Maryland|Simpsonville]], [[Atholton, Maryland|Atholton]], and in the case of the census, part of [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]]. The [[census-designated place]] had a population of 99,615 at the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt; It is the second most populous community in Maryland after [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_1YR/S0101/0400000US24.16000| title=Age and Sex: 2015 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates (S0101): All places within Maryland| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| access-date=August 1, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213125757/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_1YR/S0101/0400000US24.16000| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau's [[American Community Survey]] put the population at approximately 103,467 as of 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 ACS&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Columbia was founded by James W. Rouse (1914-1996), a native of [[Easton, Maryland]]. In 1935, Rouse obtained a job in [[Baltimore]] with the [[Federal Housing Administration]], a [[New Deal]] agency whose purpose was to promote home ownership and home construction. This position exposed Rouse to all phases of the housing industry.&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, this section is derived from {{cite book| title=New City Upon a Hill: A History of Columbia, Maryland|author1=Joseph R. Mitchell |author2=David Stebenne | pages=28–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1930s he co-founded a Baltimore mortgage banking business, the Moss-Rouse Company. In the 1950s his company, by then known as James W. Rouse and Company, branched out into developing shopping centers and malls. In 1957 Rouse formed Community Research and Development, Inc. (CRD) for the purpose of building, owning and operating shopping centers throughout the country. Community Research and Development, Inc., which was managed by James W. Rouse and Company, became a publicly traded company in 1961. In 1966, Community Research and Development, Inc. changed its name to The Rouse Company, after it had acquired James W. Rouse and Company in exchange for company stock.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;C.R.D. Board Backs Swap of Stock With Rouse Firm,&quot; ''The Baltimore Sun'', Feb. 9, 1966, p. C11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Suit Filed to Void Rouse's Recent Acquisition of Firm,&quot; ''The Baltimore Sun'', August 21, 1966, p. FE29&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s Rouse was also active in organizations whose goals were to combat [[urban decay|blight]] and promote [[urban renewal]]. Along the way, he came to recognize the importance of [[comprehensive planning]] and action to address housing issues. A talented public speaker, Rouse's speeches on housing matters attracted media attention. By the mid-1950s he was espousing his belief that in order to be successful, cities had to be places where people succeeded. In a 1959 speech he declared that the purpose of cities is for people, and that the objective of city planning should be to make a city into neighborhoods where men, women, and their families can live and work, and, most importantly, grow in character, personality, religious fulfillment, brotherhood, and the capacity for joyous living.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
  
In the early 1960s, Rouse decided to develop a new model city. Rouse's ideas about what a new model city should be like were informed by a number of factors, including his personal Christian faith as well as the goal for his company to earn a profit, influences that he did not consider to be incompatible with one another.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  After exploring possible new city locations near [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and [[Raleigh-Durham]], North Carolina, Rouse focused his attention between Baltimore and [[Washington, D.C.]], in Howard County, Maryland.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Howard County land acquisition===
In April 1962, Mel Berman, a longtime Howard County resident who was also a member of the CRD's Board of Directors, saw a sign on Cedar Lane in Howard County advertising {{convert|1309|acre}} for sale. Berman reported the option to the CRD and a decision was made to purchase the land. This was the first of 165 land purchases made by Rouse over the next year-and-a-half. In order to keep land costs low, Jack Jones, an attorney from Rouse's firm of [[DLA Piper|Piper Marbury]], set up a grid system to secretly buy land through dummy corporations like the &quot;Alaska Iron Mines Company&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Property and Law |first1=Charles Monroe |last1=Haar |first2=Lance |last2=Liebman |publisher=Little, Brown |page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reforming Suburbia: The Planned Communities of Irvine, Columbia, and The Woodlands |author=Forsythe |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these straw purchasers included Columbia Industrial Development Corporation, 95-32 Corporation, 95-216 Corporation, Premble, Inc., Columbia Mall, Inc., Oakland Ridge Industrial Development Corporation, and Columbia Development Corporation. Robert Moxley's firm Security Realty Company (now Security Development Group Inc),&lt;ref name=Sachs&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Baltimore Sun| title=Developer envisions 22 homes on 10 acres of Dasher Homestead; Moxley has ties to Columbia's birth| date=16 November 1993| author=Adam Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiated many of the land deals for Jones, becoming his best client.&lt;ref name=Sachs /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=New City Upon a Hill: A History of Columbia, Maryland |author1=Joseph R. Mitchell |author2=David Stebenne}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Columbia| author=Barbara Kellner| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRD accumulated {{convert|14178|acre|km2}}, 10 percent of Howard County, from 140 separate owners. Rouse was turned down in financing from [[David Rockefeller]], who had recently cancelled a planned Rouse &quot;Village&quot; concept called Pocantico Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|58}} The $19,122,622 acquisition was then funded by Rouse's former employer [[Cigna|Connecticut General Life Insurance]] in October 1962 at an average price of $1,500 per acre ($0.37/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The town center land of [[Oakland Manor]] was purchased from Isadore Guldesky who was turned down from building high-rises on the site by Rob Moxley's brother, County Commissioner and land developer [[Norman E. Moxley]]. Sensing that he had a key property, he requested $5 million for his {{convert|1000|acre}}, signing an agreement by hand on a land plat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Columbia and the New Cities |author=Gurney Breckenfeld |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition between Rouse and Guldesky carried over to the competing [[Tysons Corner Center]] and [[Tysons Galleria]] projects, with each hiring their competitor's employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=H. Max Ammerman Dies; Development Suburban Malls |date=1 November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1962, citizens had elected an all-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] three-member council. J. Hubert Black, [[Charles E. Miller]], and David W. Force campaigned on a slow-growth ballot, but later approved the Columbia project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper = The Baltimore Sun| date=5 December 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning|Howard County Planning Commission]] Chairman Wilmer Sanner declared, &quot;if this adds to the orderly development of the county, that's what we are looking for.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}} That July, Sanner sold the majority of his {{convert|73|acre|adj=on}} [[Simpsonville, Maryland|Simpsonville]] farm to Howard Research prior to the public announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Maryland State Archives Book 440| pages=80–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1963, the acquisition was revealed to the residents of Howard County, putting to rest rumors about the mysterious purchases. These had included theories that the site was to become a [[medical research]] laboratory or a giant [[compost]] heap. Despite the moniker of being a &quot;planned city&quot;, the planning for the city occupied Rouse officials for most of 1964 after the announcement while marketing director Scott Ditch was brought from Baltimore's [[Village of Cross Keys|Cross Keys]] development to promote the project to community groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |title=Rouse Official Oversaw Naming Of Columbia's Streets, Helped Gain Harborplace Approval |date=20 June 2009 |author=Jacques Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In December 1964 the zoning was rejected by planning director Tom Harris Jr. for handing nearly all planning control to the developer. A media push was instituted to approve the zoning by Dorris Thompson of ''[[The Howard County Times]]'', Seymour Barondes of the Howard County Civic Association, and Anita Iribe of the [[League of Women Voters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|64}} In June 1965 zoning was approved for the project, and Howard Research and Development entered into a $37.5 million construction deed backed by the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Baltimore Sun| title=Columbia's first 25 years: a chronology| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-06-14/news/1992166270_1_columbia-association-merriweather-post-pavilion-wilde-lake| date=14 June 1992| author=Columbia Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oag.state.md.us&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=HOWARD COUNTY, MARYLAND et al. v.

Miller stated that if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have voted to approve Columbia.

Clark| page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller had been defeated in the November 1974 Howard County Council elections, in part as a result of the changed political landscape that Columbia's development brought. In early 1976, a ''Columbia Flier'' editorial charged that Miller was a fear-mongering reactionary who had a personal vendetta against Columbia, Rouse and Columbia residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Columbia Flier |title=Middle Patuxent: a solid proposal |date=15 January 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unveiling and growth===
[[File:View looking southwest - Blandair, 6651 Highway 175, Columbia, Howard County, MD HABS MD-1149-6.tif|thumb|[[Blandair]], a historic plantation located in the center of Columbia]]

At the unveiling on June 21, 1967, [[James Rouse]] described Columbia as a [[planned community|planned new city]] which would avoid the [[Urban sprawl|leap-frog]] and spot development threatening the county. The new city would be complete with jobs, schools, shopping, and medical services, and a range of housing choices. [[Property tax]]es from commercial development would cover the additional services with which housing would burden the county. The [[urban planning]] process for Columbia included not only planners, but also a convened panel of nationally recognized experts in the [[social science]]s, known as the Work Group. The fourteen member group of men and one woman, [[Antonia Handler Chayes]], met for two days, twice a month, for half a year starting in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|68}} The Work Group suggested innovations for planners in education, recreation, religion, and health care, as well as ways of improving social interactions. Columbia's [[open classroom]]s, [[Interfaith worship spaces|interfaith centers]], and the then-novel idea of a [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) with a group practice of medical doctors (the Columbia Medical Plan) sprung from these meetings. The community's physical plan, with neighborhood and village centers, was also decided. Columbia's &quot;New Town District&quot; [[zoning]] ordinance gave developers great flexibility about what to put where, without requiring county approval for each specific project.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1968, vice-presidential candidate [[Spiro Agnew]] referenced Columbia to reporters, saying, &quot;Government should act as a catalyst to encourage the local governments to encourage industry and business to move next to a planned community,&quot; and &quot;I want to lessen the density in the ghettos, and concurrently rebuild the ghetto areas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Agnew Says Vice President Should Quit in a Major Rift |author=Richard Reeves |date=25 August 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, County Executive Omar J. Jones felt that the increase in tax base was lagging behind the need for infrastructure as the operating budget doubled to $15 million in three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellen Hoffman&quot;&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Washington Post| title=New Towners, The Voiceless Marylanders: Columbia Citizens Seeking More Say| author=Ellen Hoffman| date=26 September 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime rates shot up around the county by 30-50% a year, with hot spots around the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Washington Post| title=Howard County Boom Malignant or Benign?| date=19 September 1972| author=Tom Huth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Washington Post| title=Rural Howard County Goes on a Crime Alert| date=11 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, the project required additional financing to continue, borrowing $30 million from Connecticut General, [[Manufacturers Hanover Trust]], and [[Morgan Guaranty]]. In 1972, amendments to New Town zoning proposing to place a maximum height for buildings and maintain the original density limit of 2.2 units per acre were opposed by Rouse allies including the [[Columbia Association]], the Ellicott City Businessman's Association and the Columbia Democratic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |title=Rouse campaigning against Columbia zoning amendments |date=22 June 1972 |author=Michael J. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, the amount owed reached $100,000 million,{{dubious|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--that's 100 billion--&gt; prompting partner Connecticut General to consider [[bankruptcy]]. An effort to create a special taxing district in 1978 and an effort to incorporate with a mayor in 1979 failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |title=Plan to Incorporate Columbia Faces Defeat |author=Micheal J. Clark |date=21 February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Cigna (Connecticut General) divested itself of the project for $120 million. By 1990 Howard Research and Development owed $125,162,689.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Biography of James Rouse| page=234| author=Joshua Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oag.state.md.us&quot;/&gt; In 2004 the project was sold to [[General Growth Properties]], which went bankrupt in 2008. General Growth Properties submitted a plan for increasing density throughout Columbia in 2004 which was unanimously voted down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |title=Howard Week |date=19 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the project fell to the previous Rouse subsidiary the [[Howard Hughes Corporation]]. Howard Hughes submitted a new plan to increase density in 2010 under the [[Kenneth Ulman|Ulman]] administration that passed unanimously.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Columbia has never [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]]; some governance, however, is provided by the non-profit Columbia Association, which manages common areas and functions as a [[homeowner association]] with regard to private property. The first boards were filled entirely with Rouse Company appointees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellen Hoffman&quot;/&gt; The first manager of the Columbia Association was John Estabrook Slayton (d. 1967). For Slayton's contributions to the early planning of Columbia, the community center in the [[Wilde Lake, Columbia, Maryland|Wilde Lake]] village, Slayton House, was named for him. Wilde Lake was the first village area to be developed in Columbia; accordingly, the town's first [[High school (North America)|high school]] was [[Wilde Lake High School]], which opened in 1971 as a &quot;model school for the nation&quot;. Constructed in the open classroom style, it was razed in 1994 but reconstructed on the same site in 1996.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Master plan ===
To achieve the goals set forth by the Work Group, Columbia's Master Plan called for a series of ten self-contained villages, around which day-to-day life would revolve. The centerpiece of Columbia would be [[The Mall in Columbia]] and man-made [[Lake Kittamaqundi]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==== Villages and neighborhoods ====
[[File:Columbia Lake Front.jpg|thumb|The lakefront in Downtown Columbia sits upon [[Lake Kittamaqundi]]]]
The village concept aimed to provide Columbia a small-town feel (like [[Easton, Maryland]], where James Rouse grew up). Each village comprises several neighborhoods. The village center may contain middle and high schools. All villages have a shopping center, recreational facilities, a community center, a system of bike/walking paths, and homes. Four of the villages have [[Interfaith worship spaces|interfaith centers]], common worship facilities which are owned and jointly operated by a variety of religious congregations working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/heres-a-suburban-experiment-cities-can-learn-from/2017/07/11/c737165e-4d1f-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html |title=Here's a suburban experiment cities can learn from |last=Hurley |first=Amanda |date=July 13, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=January 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Columbia's neighborhoods contain single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, though some are more exclusive than others. The original plan, following the neighborhood concept of [[Clarence Perry]], would have had all the children of a neighborhood attend the same school, melding neighborhoods into a community and ensuring that all of Columbia's children get the same high-quality education. Rouse marketed the city as being &quot;color blind&quot; as a proponent of [[James Clark Jr.|Senator Clark]]'s [[Housing discrimination in the United States|fair housing]] legislation. If a neighborhood was filled with too many purchasers of a single race, houses would be [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|blocked]] until the desired ratio was met.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Columbia takes its street names from famous works of art and literature: for example, the neighborhood of Hobbit's Glen takes its street names from the work of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]; Running Brook, from the poetry of [[Robert Frost]]; and Clemens Crossing, from the work of [[Mark Twain]]. The book ''Oh, You Must Live in Columbia!'' chronicles the artistic, poetic, and historical origins of the street and place names in Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publications: Books| url=http://www.columbiaarchives.org/index.cfm?action=content.sub&amp;page=publications_books&amp;oid=5| work=Columbia Archives| publisher=[[Columbia Association]]| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725185839/http://www.columbiaarchives.org/index.cfm?action=content.sub&amp;page=publications_books&amp;oid=5| archive-date=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further expansion ===
&quot;The Downtown Columbia Plan&quot; is a 2010 amendment to the county's General Plan of expansion. It is a framework for the revitalization of Downtown Columbia over the next thirty years. Development plans for downtown projects in the years ahead will include details for that project such as neighborhood design guidelines, environmental restoration, public amenities and infrastructure. These development plans must adhere to the framework of the Downtown Columbia Plan as required by the zoning legislation. Over the life of the Downtown Columbia development project, as much as 13 million square feet of retail, commercial, residential, hotel and cultural development is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=DOWNTOWN COLUMBIA PLAN: A General Plan Amendment| url=http://planhoward.org/downtown_columbia_plan.pdf| publisher=Howard County, Maryland| access-date=2 October 2012| date=1 February 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209103631/http://planhoward.org/downtown_columbia_plan.pdf| archive-date=9 December 2013| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be accomplished in three phases, the plan calls for the formation of the non-profit Columbia Downtown Housing Corporation to build an additional 5,500 units of low income housing placed downtown in exchange for increased zoning density for other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=Patuxent| title=Group hopes to provide affordable housing in downtown Columbia| author=Lindsey McPherson| date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional development includes 4.3 million square feet of commercial office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail space, 640 hotel rooms, Merriweather Post Pavilion redevelopment and a [[Intermodal passenger transport|multi-modal transportation system]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;FAQ Downtown Columbia, MD.&quot;  Howard County, Maryland. 2012. &lt;http://www.columbiamd.com/plan/faq/&gt; Retrieved 2 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downtown Columbia Plan also has [[sustainability]] features, including goals for saving water and energy, and for ecology and livability.

Columbia's master developer, the Howard Hughes Corporation, is heading up the expansion project. The project is projected to cost $90 million and will outline development in the community for the next 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-council-votes-november-delay-1117-20161109-story.html |title=Howard County Times |last=Waseem |first=Fatimah |date=November 9, 2016 |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Columbia-Villages.svg|thumb|Map of the villages in Columbia]]

Because Columbia is unincorporated, there is confusion over its exact boundaries. In the strictest definition, Columbia comprises only the land governed under covenants by the Columbia Association. This is a considerably smaller area than the census-designated place (CDP) as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. The CDP has a total area of {{convert|83.4|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|82.7|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.7|km2|order=flip|1}}, or 0.80%, are water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010&quot;/&gt; The CDP includes a number of older communities which do not lie within the CA's purview, including the Holiday Hills, Diamondback, and Allview subdivisions and the former town of Simpsonville, as well as some land on the east side of [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]]. These areas are not part of the &quot;new town&quot;, and are not directly served by its amenities. Some of these areas are included in Columbia ZIP codes by the post office, and some are not.

Columbia is located in central Maryland, {{convert|20|mi}} southwest of [[Baltimore]], {{convert|25|mi}} northeast of [[Washington, D.C.]], and {{convert|30|mi}} northwest of [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. The community lies in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of Maryland, with its eastern edge at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. The climate tends to hot, humid summers and cool to cold and wet winters. There are occasional large amounts of snowfall that happen every year.

The primary landforms in Columbia are rolling hills and stream valleys; Columbia's road network is laid out to follow the terrain, with many winding streets and [[cul-de-sac]]s. Elevations range from about {{convert|200|to|500|ft}} above sea level. Most of Columbia is drained by the [[Middle Patuxent River|Middle Patuxent]] and [[Little Patuxent River|Little Patuxent]] rivers. There are three artificial lakes, created by damming of tributary streams during community construction. In 1965, the Rouse Company leased {{convert|7000|acre}} of farmland staged for development, and earmarked {{convert|4000|acre}} of oak forest for timber harvesting. The company developed a sapling planter to replant sections of cleared land that would use Columbia's [[W. R. Grace and Company|W.R. Grace]]-developed fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Howard County Times |date=31 March 1965 |title=HRD Howards Biggest Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outer ring of greenspace was abandoned early in the project because the combination with the already required river buffers would have reduced profitable land available for building.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|76}} Along with [[Symphony Woods]], many other stands of mature trees have been temporarily maintained in Columbia, including the large [[Middle Patuxent Environmental Area]] in the western part of the community between Harper's Choice and River Hill villages, protecting much of the river valley from development.

=== Climate ===
Columbia has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with cool winters and hot, muggy summers.

[[James Rouse]] conceived of a city, not a suburban [[bedroom community]], and a large area on the eastern edge was allocated for industrial purposes. The centerpiece of this aspect of the development was a [[General Electric]] [[Home appliance|appliance]] plant on a {{convert|1125|acre|km2|adj=on}} site previously operated as a cattle farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-05-19/news/1996140161_1_rouse-acre-farmers |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |title=Farmers: Town's forgotten pioneers.

The U.S. federal government is the source of many jobs for Columbians. Several large [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] installations and R&amp;D facilities surround Columbia, the largest being the [[National Security Agency]] at [[Fort George G. Meade]], and the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] south of Columbia, both pre-dating the establishment of Columbia. Companies which have had research facilities in the area include [[W.R. Grace and Company]] and [[Westvaco]]. Further afield, many Columbians commute to government and government contractor jobs in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

=== Shopping ===
[[The Mall in Columbia]], located in Town Center, is a large regional shopping mall with four anchor [[department store]]s ([[Nordstrom]], [[Macy's]], and [[JCPenney]]), a multiplex movie theater, and more than 200 stores and restaurants.

There are several other major competing shopping centers in [[East Columbia Business District, Columbia, Maryland|East Columbia]], including Dobbin Center strip mall opened in 1983, Snowden Square big box retail on the remainder of the GE industrial site, Columbia Crossing I and II big box retail started in 1997, and Gateway Overlook.&lt;ref name=&quot;New City&quot;/&gt;{{rp|142}}

Columbia's nine &quot;village centers&quot; provide residents with nearby shopping as well, often including supermarkets, [[gas station]]s, [[liquor]] stores, [[dry cleaning|dry cleaners]], restaurants, and [[hair salon]]s. The village centers are laid out so that individual stores are not visible from the road, unlike traditional [[strip mall]]s. The arrangement is criticized because it makes it difficult for newcomers and non-residents to know what shopping is available; it is praised for eliminating much of the garishness of roadside America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

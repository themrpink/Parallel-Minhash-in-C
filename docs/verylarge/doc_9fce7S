==== CFCs and related compounds in the atmosphere ====
[[Chlorofluorocarbon|Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) and other halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are mainly responsible for man-made chemical ozone depletion. The total amount of effective halogens (chlorine and bromine) in the stratosphere can be calculated and are known as the [[equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine]] (EESC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A new formulation of equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) |journal=Atmos.

They also occur as by-products of some chemical processes. No significant natural sources have ever been identified for these compounds—their presence in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to human manufacture. As mentioned above, when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms act as a [[catalyst]], and each can break down tens of thousands of ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere. Given the longevity of CFC molecules, recovery times are measured in decades. It is calculated that a CFC molecule takes an average of about five to seven years to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere, and it can stay there for about a century, destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-chlorofl.html |title=chlorofluorocarbons |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=April 2011}}

[[1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane]], also known as CFC-113a, is one of four man-made chemicals newly discovered in the atmosphere by a team at the University of East Anglia. CFC-113a is the only known [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] whose abundance in the atmosphere is still growing. Its source remains a mystery, but illegal manufacturing is suspected by some.  CFC-113a seems to have been accumulating unabated since 1960. Between 2010 and 2012, emissions of the gas jumped by 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Newly detected ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=266–269|date=March 9, 2014|doi=10.1038/ngeo2109| bibcode=2014NatGe...7..266L |last1=Laube|first1=Johannes C.|last2=Newland|first2=Mike J.|last3=Hogan|first3=Christopher|last4=Brenninkmeijer|first4=Carl A.

A study by an international team of researchers published in ''Nature'' found that since 2013 emissions that are predominately from north-eastern China have released large quantities of the banned chemical Chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) into the atmosphere.

=== Computer modeling ===
Scientists have attributed ozone depletion to the increase of man-made ([[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]]) halogen compounds from CFCs by combining observational data with computer models. These complex chemistry transport models (e.g. [[SLIMCAT]], [[CLaMS]]—Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere) work by combining measurements of chemicals and meteorological fields with chemical reaction rate constants. They identify key chemical reactions and transport processes that bring CFC [[photodissociation|photolysis]] products into contact with ozone.

== Ozone hole and its causes ==

The Antarctic ozone hole is an area of the Antarctic stratosphere in which the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this [[polar vortex]], over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sparling |first=Brien |url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=Antarctic Ozone Hole |publisher=NASA Advanced Supercomputing Department |date=June 26, 2001 |access-date=April 16, 2011 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http%3A//www%2Enas%2Enasa%2Egov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic%2Ehtml |archive-date= April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained above, the primary cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-containing source gases (primarily CFCs and related halocarbons). In the presence of UV light, these gases dissociate, releasing chlorine atoms, which then go on to catalyze ozone destruction. The Cl-catalyzed ozone depletion can take place in the gas phase, but it is dramatically enhanced in the presence of [[polar stratospheric cloud]]s (PSCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parson |first=Robert |date= December 16, 1997 |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ozone-depletion/antarctic |title=Antarctic ozone-depletion FAQ, section 7 |publisher=Faqs.org |access-date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These polar stratospheric clouds form during winter, in the extreme cold. Polar winters are dark, consisting of three months without solar radiation (sunlight). The lack of sunlight contributes to a decrease in temperature and the polar vortex traps and chills the air. Temperatures hover around or below −80&amp;nbsp;°C. These low temperatures form cloud particles. There are three types of PSC clouds—nitric acid trihydrate clouds, slowly cooling water-ice clouds, and rapid cooling water-ice (nacreous) clouds—provide surfaces for chemical reactions whose products will, in the spring lead to ozone destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toon |first1=Owen B. |last2=Turco |first2=Richard P. |title=Polar Stratospheric Clouds and Ozone Depletion |date=June 1991 |journal=Scientific American |volume=264 |issue=6 |pages=68–74 |url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~davidc/ATMS211/articles_optional/Toon_Turco91_ozone.pdf |access-date=April 16, 2011 |bibcode=1991SciAm.264...68T |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0691-68 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225082537/http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~davidc/ATMS211/articles_optional/Toon_Turco91_ozone.pdf |archive-date=February 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[photochemistry|photochemical]] processes involved are complex but well understood. The key observation is that, ordinarily, most of the chlorine in the stratosphere resides in &quot;reservoir&quot; compounds, primarily chlorine nitrate ({{chem|ClONO|2}}) as well as stable end products such as HCl. The formation of end products essentially removes Cl from the ozone depletion process. The former sequester Cl, which can be later made available via absorption of light at shorter wavelengths than 400&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sumi´nska-Ebersoldt |title=ClOOCl photolysis at high solar zenith angles: analysis of the RECONCILE self-match flight |date=July 2011 |journal=Atmos.

The process by which the clouds remove {{chem|NO|2}} from the stratosphere by converting it to nitric acid in the PSC particles, which then are lost by sedimentation is called denitrification. This prevents newly formed ClO from being converted back into {{chem|ClONO|2}}.

The role of sunlight in ozone depletion is the reason why the Antarctic ozone depletion is greatest during spring. During winter, even though PSCs are at their most abundant, there is no light over the pole to drive chemical reactions. During the spring, however, the sun comes out, providing energy to drive photochemical reactions and melt the polar stratospheric clouds, releasing considerable ClO, which drives the hole mechanism. Further warming temperatures near the end of spring break up the vortex around mid-December. As warm, ozone and {{chem|NO|2}}-rich air flows in from lower latitudes, the PSCs are destroyed, the enhanced ozone depletion process shuts down, and the ozone hole closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/hole.html |title=Ozone Facts: What is the Ozone Hole? |work=Ozone Hole Watch |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=November 18, 2009 |access-date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the ozone that is destroyed is in the lower stratosphere, in contrast to the much smaller ozone depletion through homogeneous gas-phase reactions, which occurs primarily in the upper stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frank Sherwood |last=Rowland |author-link=Frank Sherwood Rowland |title=Stratospheric ozone depletion |journal= Phil.

=== Interest in ozone layer depletion ===
Public misconceptions and misunderstandings of complex issues like ozone depletion are common.

In the beginning, classical green NGOs refrained from using CFC depletion for campaigning, as they assumed the topic was too complicated.&lt;ref name = RG /&gt; They became active much later, e.g. in Greenpeace's support for a CFC-free fridge produced by the former East German company [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] dkk Scharfenstein.&lt;ref name = RG /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title=Öko-Coup aus Ostdeutschland |url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/oeko-revolution-aus-ostdeutschland-wie-foron-den-ersten-fckw-freien-kuehlschrank-der-welt-erfand-a-951064.html|date=September 13, 2013 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |access-date=4 September 2015|last1=Gunkel|first1=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphors used in the CFC discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) are not &quot;exact&quot; in the scientific sense. The &quot;ozone hole&quot; is more of a ''depression'', less &quot;a hole in the windshield&quot;. The ozone does not disappear through the layer, nor is there a uniform &quot;thinning&quot; of the ozone layer. However, they resonated better with non-scientists and their concerns.&lt;ref name = Ungar /&gt; The ozone hole was seen as a &quot;hot issue&quot; and imminent risk&lt;ref name=&quot;PAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | date=14 May 2007 | first1=Reiner | journal=Environmental Politics | issue=3 | last1=Grundmann | url=http://stsclimate.soc.ku.dk/papers/grundmannclimatechangeandknowledgepolitics.pdf | title=Climate Change and Knowledge Politics | volume=16 | pages=414–432 | doi=10.1080/09644010701251656 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115142/http://stsclimate.soc.ku.dk/papers/grundmannclimatechangeandknowledgepolitics.pdf | archive-date=August 26, 2014 | df=mdy-all | citeseerx=10.1.1.535.4984 | s2cid=153866225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as laypeople feared severe personal consequences such as skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean's photic zone. Not only on the policy level, [[Ozone depletion and climate change|ozone regulation compared to climate change]] fared much better in public opinion. Americans voluntarily switched away from aerosol sprays before legislation was enforced, while climate change failed to achieve comparable concern and public action.&lt;ref name = Ungar /&gt; The sudden identification in 1985 that there was a substantial &quot;hole&quot; was widely reported in the press.

While the Antarctic ozone hole has a relatively small effect on global ozone, the hole has generated a great deal of public interest because:

* Many have worried that ozone holes might start appearing over other areas of the globe, though to date the only other large-scale depletion is a smaller ozone &quot;dimple&quot; observed during the Arctic spring around the North Pole. Ozone at middle latitudes has declined, but by a much smaller extent (a decrease of about 4–5 percent).
* If stratospheric conditions become more severe (cooler temperatures, more clouds, more active chlorine), global ozone may decrease at a greater pace. Standard [[global warming]] theory predicts that the stratosphere will cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/351.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis |pages=Chapter 9.3.2 Patterns of Future Climate Change |year=2001 |work=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] Work Group I |access-date=May 28, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603033745/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F351.htm |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences of ozone layer depletion ==
Since the ozone layer absorbs [[Ultraviolet B|UVB]] ultraviolet light from the sun, ozone layer depletion increases surface UVB levels (all else equal), which could lead to damage, including an increase in [[skin cancer]]. This was the reason for the Montreal Protocol. Although decreases in stratospheric ozone are well-tied to CFCs and increases in surface UVB, there is no direct observational evidence linking ozone depletion to higher incidence of skin cancer and eye damage in human beings. This is partly because [[Ultraviolet|UVA]], which has also been implicated in some forms of skin cancer, is not absorbed by ozone, and because it is nearly impossible to control statistics for lifestyle changes over time. Ozone depletion may also influence wind patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Antara |title=A pause in Southern Hemisphere circulation trends due to the Montreal Protocol |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=25 March 2020 |volume=579 |issue=7800 |pages=544–548 |doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2120-4 |pmid=32214266 |bibcode=2020Natur.579..544B |s2cid=214648481 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2120-4 |access-date=31 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased UV ===
Ozone, while a minority constituent in Earth's atmosphere, is responsible for most of the absorption of UVB radiation. The amount of UVB radiation that penetrates through the ozone layer [[exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] with the slant-path thickness and density of the layer. When stratospheric ozone levels decrease, higher levels of UVB reach the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/effects/ |publisher=EPA |access-date=September 26, 2013|date=2013-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UV-driven phenolic formation in tree rings has dated the start of ozone depletion in northern latitudes to the late 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arm.gov/publications/proceedings/conf12/extended_abs/zuev-vv.pdf |title=Reconstruction of Paleobehavior of Ozonosphere Based on Response to UV-B Radiation Effect in Dendrochronologic Signal |publisher=Atmospheric Radiation Measurement, USA |access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the [[Ecuadorian Space Agency]] published a report called HIPERION. The study used ground instruments in Ecuador and the last 28 years' data from 12 satellites of several countries, and found that the UV radiation reaching equatorial latitudes was far greater than expected, with the [[UV Index]] climbing as high as 24 in [[Quito]]; the [[WHO]] considers 11 as an extreme index and a great risk to health. The report concluded that depleted ozone levels around the mid-latitudes of the planet are already endangering large populations in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date=2008|title=The HIPERION Report|url=http://exa.ec/HIPERION-Report_files/The-HIPERION-Report.pdf|publisher=Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the CONIDA, the Peruvian Space Agency, published its own study, which yielded almost the same findings as the Ecuadorian study.

=== Biological effects ===
The main public concern regarding the ozone hole has been the effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If the high levels of depletion seen in the ozone hole were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more dramatic. As the ozone hole over Antarctica has in some instances grown so large as to affect parts of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[South Africa]], environmentalists have been concerned that the increase in surface UV could be significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119899 |title=Ozone Hole Over City for First Time |first=Ray |last=Lilley |agency=Associated Press |date=October 5, 2000 |access-date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone depletion would magnify all of the [[Health effects of sun exposure|effects of UV on human health]], both positive (including production of vitamin D) and negative (including sunburn, skin cancer, and cataracts). In addition, increased surface UV leads to increased tropospheric ozone, which is a health risk to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bais|first1=F.|last2=Luca|first2=R.

==== Basal and squamous cell carcinomas ====
The most common forms of skin cancer in humans, [[Basal cell carcinoma|basal]] and [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous]] cell carcinomas, have been strongly linked to UVB exposure. The mechanism by which UVB induces these cancers is well understood—absorption of UVB radiation causes the pyrimidine bases in the DNA molecule to form [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]], resulting in transcription errors when the DNA replicates. These cancers are relatively mild and rarely fatal, although the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma sometimes requires extensive reconstructive surgery. By combining epidemiological data with results of animal studies, scientists have estimated that every one percent decrease in long-term stratospheric ozone would increase the incidence of these cancers by 2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;gcrio.org-consequnces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Gruijl, Frank R. |title=Impacts of a Projected Depletion of the Ozone Layer |journal=Consequences |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=Summer 1995 |url=http://www.wvvvv.gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/summer95/impacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malignant melanoma ====
Another form of skin cancer, malignant [[melanoma]], is much less common but far more dangerous, being lethal in about 15–20 percent of the cases diagnosed. The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet exposure is not yet fully understood, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved. Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on melanoma incidence. One study showed that a 10 percent increase in UVB radiation was associated with a 19 percent increase in melanomas for men and 16 percent for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Average midrange ultraviolet radiation flux and time outdoors predict melanoma risk |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=62 |issue=14 |pages=3992–6 |year=2002|pmid=12124332 |last1=Fears |first1=T.

Epidemiological studies suggest an association between ocular cortical cataracts and UVB exposure, using crude approximations of exposure and various cataract assessment techniques. A detailed assessment of ocular exposure to UVB was carried out in a study on Chesapeake Bay Watermen, where increases in average annual ocular exposure were associated with increasing risk of cortical opacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sunlight exposure and risk of lens opacities in a population-based study: the Salisbury Eye Evaluation project |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=8 |pages=714–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9728643|doi=10.1001/jama.280.8.714 |last1=West |first1=S.

D. |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this highly exposed group of predominantly white males, the evidence linking cortical opacities to sunlight exposure was the strongest to date. Based on these results, ozone depletion is predicted to cause hundreds of thousands of additional cataracts by 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobson2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Dobson, R. | title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d               }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Increased tropospheric ozone ====
Increased surface UV leads to increased [[tropospheric]] ozone. Ground-level ozone is generally recognized to be a health risk, as ozone is toxic due to its strong [[redox|oxidant]] properties. The risks are particularly high for young children, the elderly, and those with asthma or other respiratory difficulties. At this time, ozone at ground level is produced mainly by the action of UV radiation on [[combustion]] gases from vehicle exhausts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/airquality/ozonepollution/pdfs/ozonegb.pdf |title=Ozone: Good Up High, Bad Nearby |publisher=EPA |access-date=March 13, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602101003/http://www.epa.gov/airquality/ozonepollution/pdfs/ozonegb.pdf |archive-date=June 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Increased production of vitamin D ====
[[Vitamin D]] is produced in the skin by ultraviolet light. Thus, higher UVB exposure raises human vitamin D in those deficient in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=Ann R.|last2=Engelsen|first2=Ola|date=2006|title=Calculated Ultraviolet Exposure Levels for a Healthy Vitamin D Status|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|language=en|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1697–1703|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2006.tb09833.x|pmid=16958558|s2cid=222102318|issn=1751-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research (primarily since the Montreal Protocol) shows that many humans have less than optimal vitamin D levels. In particular, in the U.S. population, the lowest quarter of vitamin D (&lt;17.8&amp;nbsp;ng/ml) were found using information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to be associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=25-hydroxyl Vitamin D Levels and the Risk of Mortality in the General Population |journal=Arch.

==== Effects on animals ====
A November 2011 report by scientists at the Institute of Zoology in London found that [[whale]]s off the coast of California have shown a sharp rise in sun damage, and these scientists &quot;fear that the thinning ozone layer is to blame&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2010/11/sunburned_whales_bad_environme.html |title=Sunburned whales: Troubling environment news of the week |publisher=BlogPost (blog) |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 11, 2010 |access-date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study photographed and took skin biopsies from over 150 whales in the Gulf of California and found &quot;widespread evidence of epidermal damage commonly associated with acute and severe sunburn&quot;, having cells that form when the DNA is damaged by UV radiation.

==== Effects on crops ====
An increase of UV radiation would be expected to affect crops. A number of economically important species of plants, such as [[rice]], depend on [[cyanobacteria]] residing on their roots for the retention of [[nitrogen]]. [[Cyanobacteria]] are sensitive to UV radiation and would be affected by its increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Effects on Plant life ====
Depletion of the ozone layer and allowing excess UVB radiation would initially be assumed to increase damage done to plant DNA. Reports have found that when plants are exposed to UVB radiation similar to stratospheric ozone depletion, there was no significant change in plant height or leaf mass, but showed to respond in shoot biomass and leaf area in a small decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Searles|first1=Peter S.|last2=Flint|first2=Stephan D.|last3=Caldwell|first3=Martyn M.|date=2001-03-01|title=A meta-analysis of plant field studies simulating stratospheric ozone depletion|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=127|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s004420000592|pmid=28547159|bibcode=2001Oecol.127....1S|s2cid=7049908|issn=1432-1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, UVB radiation has shown to decrease quantum yield of photosystem II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=Fusheng S.|last2=Day|first2=Thomas A.|date=2001-02-01|title=Effect of Solar Ultraviolet-B Radiation during Springtime Ozone Depletion on Photosynthesis and Biomass Production of Antarctic Vascular Plants|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=125|issue=2|pages=738–751|doi=10.1104/pp.125.2.738|issn=0032-0889|pmid=11161031|pmc=64875}}&lt;/ref&gt; UVB damage only occurs under extreme exposure, and most plants also have UVB absorbing flavonoids which allow them to acclimatize to the radiation present.

The full extent of the damage that CFCs have caused to the ozone layer is not known and will not be known for decades; however, marked decreases in column ozone have already been observed. The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established or important uncertainties in the science field were being resolved.&lt;ref name = RG /&gt; The ozone case was understood comparably well by lay persons as e.g. ''Ozone shield'' or ''ozone hole'' were useful &quot;easy-to-understand bridging metaphors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ungar&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ungar|first1=Sheldon|title=Knowledge, ignorance and the popular culture: climate change versus the ozone hole|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=1 July 2000|volume=9|issue=3|pages=297–312|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/306|s2cid=7089937|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1398f54b3e621be9ef46f35259e39f01ffe2ad64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans voluntarily switched away from aerosol sprays, resulting in a 50 percent sales loss even before legislation was enforced.&lt;ref name = Ungar /&gt;

A critical DuPont manufacturing patent for [[Freon]] was [[Chlorofluorocarbon#Regulation and DuPont|set to expire in 1979]]. The United States banned the use of CFCs in aerosol cans in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrisette1989&quot; /&gt; The European Community rejected proposals to ban CFCs in aerosol sprays, and in the U.S., CFCs continued to be used as refrigerants and for cleaning circuit boards. Worldwide CFC production fell sharply after the U.S. aerosol ban, but by 1986 had returned nearly to its 1976 level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrisette1989&quot; /&gt; In 1993, [[DuPont (1802–2017)|DuPont]] Canada closed its CFC facility.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, Arthur R.

The U.S. government's attitude began to change again in 1983, when [[William Ruckelshaus]] replaced [[Anne M. Burford]] as Administrator of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 twenty nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]], which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Meanwhile, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than its European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer, especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40&amp;nbsp;million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shabecoff, Philip |title=U.S. Report Predicts Rise in Skin Cancer with Loss of Ozone |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/us/us-report-predicts-rise-in-skin-cancer-with-loss-of-ozone.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 5, 1986 |page=A1 |access-date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation.

At Montreal, the participants agreed to freeze production of CFCs at 1986 levels and to reduce production by 50 percent by 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrisette1989&quot; /&gt; After a series of scientific expeditions to the Antarctic produced convincing evidence that the ozone hole was indeed caused by chlorine and bromine from manmade organohalogens, the Montreal Protocol was strengthened at a 1990 meeting in London. The participants agreed to phase out CFCs and halons entirely (aside from a very small amount marked for certain &quot;essential&quot; uses, such as [[asthma inhaler]]s) by 2000 in non-Article 5 countries and by 2010 in Article 5 (less developed) signatories.&lt;ref name=&quot;hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/intpol/history.html |title=Amendments to the Montreal Protocol &amp;#124; Ozone Layer Protection &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=June 28, 2006 |access-date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1992 meeting in Copenhagen, the phase-out date was moved up to 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;hist&quot; /&gt; At the same meeting, [[methyl bromide]] (MeBr), a fumigant used primarily in agricultural production, was added to the list of controlled substances. For all substances controlled under the protocol, phaseout schedules were delayed for less developed ('Article 5(1)') countries, and phaseout in these countries was supported by transfers of expertise, technology, and money from non-Article 5(1) Parties to the Protocol. Additionally, exemptions from the agreed schedules could be applied for under the Essential Use Exemption (EUE) process for substances other than methyl bromide and under the Critical Use Exemption (CUE) process for methyl bromide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10784-010-9120-z |title=A critical review of the successful CFC phase-out versus the delayed methyl bromide phase-out in the Montreal Protocol |journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=209–231 |year=2010 |last1=Gareau |first1=Brian J. |s2cid=153692785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Economics of the 'Critical use' of Methyl Bromide under the Montreal Protocol |journal=[[Contemporary Economic Policy]] |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=376–393 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1093/cep/byi028|last1=Decanio |first1=Stephen J. |last2=Norman |first2=Catherine S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some extent, CFCs were being replaced by the less damaging hydrochlorofluorocarbons ([[HCFC]]s), although concerns remain regarding HCFCs also. In some applications, hydrofluorocarbons ([[Hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]]) were being used to replace CFCs. HFCs, which contain no chlorine or bromine, do not contribute at all to ozone depletion although they are potent greenhouse gases. The best known of these compounds is probably HFC-134a ([[R-134a]]), which in the United States has largely replaced CFC-12 ([[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]]) in automobile air conditioners.

=== ODS requirements in the marine industry ===
The [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] has amended [[MARPOL]] Annex VI Regulation 12 regarding ozone depleting substances. As from July 1, 2010, all vessels where MARPOL Annex VI is applicable should have a list of equipment using ozone depleting substances. The list should include name of ODS, type and location of equipment, quantity in kg and date. All changes since that date should be recorded in an ODS Record book on board recording all intended or unintended releases to the atmosphere. Furthermore, new ODS supply or landing to shore facilities should be recorded as well.

== Prospects of ozone depletion ==

Since the adoption and strengthening of the [[Montreal Protocol]] has led to reductions in the emissions of CFCs, atmospheric concentrations of the most-significant compounds have been declining. These substances are being gradually removed from the atmosphere; since peaking in 1994, the Effective Equivalent Chlorine (EECl) level in the atmosphere had dropped about 10 percent by 2008. The decrease in ozone-depleting chemicals has also been significantly affected by a decrease in [[bromine]]-containing chemicals. The data suggest that substantial natural sources exist for atmospheric [[methyl bromide]] ({{chem|CH|3|Br}}).&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q /&gt; The phase-out of CFCs means that [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), which is not covered by the Montreal Protocol, has become the most highly emitted ozone-depleting substance and is expected to remain so throughout the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/20090827_ozone.html |title=NOAA Study Shows Nitrous Oxide Now Top Ozone-Depleting Emission |publisher=Noaanews.noaa.gov |date=August 27, 2009 |access-date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] review of ozone observations and model calculations concluded that the global amount of ozone has now approximately stabilized. Although considerable variability is expected from year to year, including in polar regions where depletion is largest, the ozone layer is expected to begin to recover in coming decades due to declining ozone-depleting substance concentrations, assuming full compliance with the Montreal Protocol.&lt;ref name=&quot;spm_ozone&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Summary for Policymakers |chapter-url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sroc/sroc_spm.pdf |title=IPCC/TEAP special report on safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system: issues related to hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons |publisher=Published for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [by] Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-86336-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/ipccteapspecialr0000inte |access-date=May 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic ozone hole is expected to continue for decades. Ozone concentrations in the lower stratosphere over Antarctica will increase by 5–10 percent by 2020 and return to pre-1980 levels by about 2060–2075. This is 10–25 years later than predicted in earlier assessments, because of revised estimates of atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances, including a larger predicted future usage in developing countries. Another factor that may prolong ozone depletion is the drawdown of nitrogen oxides from above the stratosphere due to changing wind patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080111005300/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/October2006/06/c5891.html Canada's SCISAT satellite explains 2006 ozone-layer depletion].

== Research history ==
{{See also|Ozone–oxygen cycle}}

The basic physical and chemical processes that lead to the formation of an ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere were discovered by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] in 1930. Short-wavelength UV radiation splits an oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) molecule into two oxygen (O) atoms, which then combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone. Ozone is removed when an oxygen atom and an ozone molecule &quot;recombine&quot; to form two oxygen molecules, i.e. O + {{chem|O|3}} → 2{{chem|O|2}}. In the 1950s, David Bates and Marcel Nicolet presented evidence that various free radicals, in particular hydroxyl (OH) and nitric oxide (NO), could catalyze this recombination reaction, reducing the overall amount of ozone. These free radicals were known to be present in the stratosphere, and so were regarded as part of the natural balance—it was estimated that in their absence, the ozone layer would be about twice as thick as it currently is.

In 1970 [[Paul Crutzen]] pointed out that emissions of [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), a stable, long-lived gas produced by soil bacteria, from the Earth's surface could affect the amount of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of [[fertilizers]] might have led to an increase in nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger aircraft]], which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer. However, more recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], found that the drop in ozone would be from 1–2 percent if a fleet of 500 supersonic passenger aircraft were operated.&lt;ref&gt;Lipkin, Richard (October 7, 1995). [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-17639207 SST emissions cut stratospheric ozone. (The introduction of 500 new supersonic transport planes by 2015 could deplete the ozone layer by as much as 1%)]. Science News.&lt;/ref&gt; This, Fahey expressed, would not be a showstopper for advanced supersonic passenger aircraft development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-08/news/1995281022_1_ozone-sulfur-exhaust-particles |title=Increase in supersonic jets could be threat to ozone U-2 plane trails Concorde, studies exhaust particles |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |agency=Newsday |date=October 8, 1995 |access-date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rowland–Molina hypothesis ===
In 1974 [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]], Chemistry Professor at the University of California at Irvine, and his postdoctoral associate [[Mario J. Molina]] suggested that long-lived organic halogen compounds, such as CFCs, might behave in a similar fashion as Crutzen had proposed for nitrous oxide. [[James Lovelock]] had recently discovered, during a cruise in the South Atlantic in 1971, that almost all of the CFC compounds manufactured since their invention in 1930 were still present in the atmosphere. Molina and Rowland concluded that, like {{chem|N|2|O}}, the CFCs would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. A year earlier, Richard Stolarski and [[Ralph Cicerone]] at the University of Michigan had shown that Cl is even more efficient than NO at catalyzing the destruction of ozone. Similar conclusions were reached by [[Michael McElroy (scientist)|Michael McElroy]] and [[Steven Wofsy]] at [[Harvard University]]. Neither group, however, had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of stratospheric chlorine—instead, they had been investigating the possible effects of HCl emissions from the [[Space Shuttle]], which are very much smaller.

The Rowland–Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The Chair of the Board of [[DuPont (1802–2017)|DuPont]] was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is &quot;a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeace-ozone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/moral97/6dupont.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093303/http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/moral97/6dupont.html |archive-date=April 6, 2012 |title=Du Pont: A case study in the 3D corporate strategy |publisher=Greenpeace |year=1997 |url-status=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Abplanalp]], the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of [[UC Irvine]] to complain about Rowland's public statements.&lt;ref&gt;Roan, Sharon (1989) ''Ozone crisis: The 15-year evolution of a sudden global emergency'', New York: Wiley, p.&amp;nbsp;56 {{ISBN|0-471-52823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the chlorine reservoir species (HCl and {{chem|ClONO|2}}) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for ozone loss than chlorine atoms and argued that the [[Organic compounds|brominated organic compounds]] known as [[Haloalkane|halons]], widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] released a report concluding that the ozone depletion hypothesis was strongly supported by the scientific evidence.  In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol spray cans]] in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels. By 1984, when better evidence on the speed of critical reactions was available, this estimate was changed to 5 to 9 percent steady-state depletion.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAS_report&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Causes and Effects of Stratospheric Ozone Reduction: An Update |publisher=National Research Council |date=1982 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309032482 |isbn=978-0-309-03248-3|page=Summary, 3|doi=10.17226/319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crutzen, Molina, and Rowland were awarded the 1995 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their work on stratospheric ozone.

[[Susan Solomon]], an atmospheric chemist at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), proposed that [[chemical reaction]]s on [[polar stratospheric cloud]]s (PSCs) in the cold [[Antarctic]] [[stratosphere]] caused a massive, though localized and seasonal, increase in the amount of [[chlorine]] present in active, ozone-destroying forms. The polar stratospheric clouds in Antarctica are only formed when there are very low temperatures, as low as −80&amp;nbsp;°C, and early spring conditions. In such conditions the [[ice crystals]] of the cloud provide a suitable surface for conversion of unreactive chlorine compounds into reactive chlorine compounds, which can deplete ozone easily.

Moreover, the [[polar vortex]] formed over [[Antarctica]] is very tight and the reaction occurring on the surface of the cloud crystals is far different from when it occurs in atmosphere. These conditions have led to ozone hole formation in Antarctica. This [[hypothesis]] was decisively confirmed, first by [[laboratory]] measurements and subsequently by direct measurements, from the ground and from high-altitude [[airplane]]s, of very high concentrations of [[chlorine monoxide]] (ClO) in the Antarctic stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = P.

'Le Petoman' (without the e, because English-speaking audiences will pronounce -mane differently from -man) was adapted for the theatre in 2001 by Tony Stowers, from the book 'Le Petomane 1857-1945' by J. Nohain &amp; F. Caradec. It was turned down by [[Hull Truck Theatre|Hull Truck]], [[Salisbury Playhouse]] and the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in the UK on the grounds that they felt their audiences would be 'too sophisticated' for the subject matter. Instead it has been read in English in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2005, in Paris in 2010 and again in Nantes in 2018, and to this day remains unperformed but often read. In 2010, it was translated into French by Tony Stowers and Kester Lovelace and appears in 'French Collection' and 'Plays: Volume Three' by Tony Stowers.

Danish comedian group &quot;Ørkenens Sønner&quot; (&quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;) have among their acts around 2010 a rendition of &quot;Otto Fjærtoman&quot; (&quot;Otto the Fart-Maniac&quot;), a little perpetually-smiling man with a nice suit and open-buttocks trousers, and a surprising ability to do various things fart-related, like inflating balloons or pushing himself across the stage on a skateboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ørkenens Sønner - bogen|last=Peter|first=Schepelern|date=2008|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=9788702073133|edition=[1. oplag]|location=[Kbh.]|oclc=474186331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Rossiter''' (21 October 1926 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1984) was an English actor. He had a long career in the theatre but achieved his greatest fame for his television comedy roles, most notably starring as Rupert Rigsby in the ITV series ''[[Rising Damp]]'' from 1974 to 1978, and Reginald Perrin in the BBC's ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' from 1976 to 1979.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life and stage work==
Rossiter was born on 21 October 1926 in [[Wavertree]], [[Liverpool]], the second son of John and Elizabeth (née Howell) Rossiter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/66/Leonard-Rossiter.html Rossiter profile at FilmReference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphreview&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8188742/Leonard-Rossiter-Character-Driven-review.html| title=Leonard Rossiter, Character Driven: review| accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived over the barber shop owned by his father. He was educated at the [[Liverpool Collegiate School]] (1939–46).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tanitch ''Leonard Rossiter'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; His ambition was to go to university to read modern languages and become a teacher. However, his father, who served as a voluntary ambulanceman during the [[Second World War]], was killed in an [[strategic bombing|air raid]] in 1941 and Rossiter had to support his mother. He therefore could not take up the place he had been offered at [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Leonard Rossiter'' by Robert Tanitch; {{ISBN|0-947728-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he did his [[National Service]] as a sergeant, initially in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], then in the [[Royal Army Educational Corps|Army Education Corps]], spending much of the time in Germany writing letters home for other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The joke that led Leonard Rossiter to stardom...and Rigsby|last=Knight|first=Val|quote=I was in just before the end of the Japanese war. The war in Germany was over, clearly why I went to Germany at that time...to teach soldiers, most of whom had missed schooling during the war, to read and write. It was weird really. I was immediately made a sergeant. Well you had to have some sort of rank because as a private in the classroom, teaching old soldiers their A, B, C, you'd soon have been given the brush off. I spent most of the time writing their letters home, you know 'Dear Mum...'|date=1 April 1978|newspaper=[[TVTimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being [[demobbed]] he worked for six years as an insurance clerk in the claims and accident departments of the [[Commercial Union|Commercial Union Insurance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview on BBC R4 Desert Island Discs 12 April 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

From childhood he was an apparently unlikely but in fact enthusiastic and capable sportsman in football, cricket, tennis and later squash.

Rossiter started acting after his actress girlfriend challenged him to try it, after he had scoffed at the performances of the amateur group she was in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Rossiter revels in Rising Damp|quote=Having Rossiter in the part, incidentally, is all down to a former girlfriend who is called Ida. She was in an amateur group and when the young Rossiter watched her at rehearsals he told her he thought he could do better. 'I suppose you could do better!' she snapped. 'I couldn't do worse,' he said. So he joined the group.|date=7 November 1975|newspaper=[[TVTimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Wavertree Community Centre Drama Group and made his first appearance with the Adastra Players in [[Terence Rattigan]]'s ''[[Flare Path (play)|Flare Path]]''. The local critic said that he &quot;was particularly outstanding, his one fault being a tendency to speak too fast on one or two occasions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tanitch, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up his insurance job to enrol in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] [[repertory|repertory theatre]] and became a professional actor at the comparatively late age of 27. He made his professional stage debut in Joseph Colton's ''The Gay Dog'' in Preston on 6 September 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Change of Policy|quote=Twenty-seven year-old Leonard Rossiter, Reginald Salberg's latest 'find' at Preston, was an insurance inspector in Liverpool until about three months ago. For years before he nursed an ambition to become an actor, and it was only the stress of domestic circumstances that baulked earlier efforts to reach his goal. Last August his family responsibilities were considerably relieved and he sought an interview with Mr. Salberg. As it happened, the application that got him his first small part (in 'The Gay Dog') was most opportunely timed. If it had been made a week before, or a week later, he would probably be still carrying out duties as an insurance claims assessor...|date=18 November 1954|newspaper=[[The Stage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later became assistant stage manager there, and then went on to [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Salisbury]] repertory companies. In his first 19 months in the business he played some 75 roles. He said later: &quot;There was no time to discuss the finer points of interpretation. You studied the part, you did it and then you studied the next part. I developed a frightening capacity for learning lines. The plays became like [[Elastoplast]], which you just stuck on and then tore off. It was the perfect preparation for rehearsing [[situation comedy]] on television at the rate of one episode a week.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tanitch, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957–58 he played in the musical ''[[Free as Air]]'' and then toured in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''. He joined the [[Bristol Old Vic]] and was there for two years, from 1959 to 1961, a time he described as &quot;the bedrock of his career&quot;, followed by other stage work, in, among other plays, ''The Strange Case of Martin Richter'', ''Disabled'', ''The Heretic'', ''[[The Caretaker]]'' and ''Semi-Detached'' (in New York). His performance in the premiere of [[Michael Blakemore]]'s stage production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'' in 1969 met with critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Tanitch, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television career==
Rossiter soon established himself as a respected character actor in films and television, as well as on stage. He stated: &quot;I think I sensed fairly early on that I was not physically or facially built in the way that would ever fit even remotely into heroic or what used to be called juvenile parts. I always played character parts - right from the start.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|title=Rossiter's irresistible rise|date=4 September 1982|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first film role was in ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962). In ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963) he played the title character's boss.  His first major television role was as Detective-Inspector Bamber in the long-running police television series ''[[Z-Cars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Some Joe You Don't Know: An American Biographical Guide to 100 British Television Personalities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S4f-nobIxEC|first=Anthony|last=Slide|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1996|isbn=9780313295508|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had guest roles in series as diverse as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' (&quot;The Lead Man Cometh&quot;, 1964; &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, 1972) and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (&quot;[[Dressed to Kill (The Avengers)|Dressed to Kill]]&quot;, 1963). Among his early film credits were four films directed by [[Bryan Forbes]], namely ''[[King Rat (film)|King Rat]]'' (1965), ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966), ''[[The Whisperers]]'' (1967) and ''[[Deadfall (1968 film)|Deadfall]]'' (1968).

In 1968 he played Mr Sowerberry in the film version of [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' and took one of the few speaking supporting roles in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as the Russian scientist Smyslov. He worked with [[Stanley Kubrick]] again in ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), in which he appeared as Captain John Quin. In the same year as ''2001'' he appeared in [[Nigel Kneale]]'s television play ''[[The Year of the Sex Olympics]]'', part of [[BBC Two|BBC 2]]'s ''[[Theatre 625]]'', one of his four appearances in the series.

In ''[[Rising Damp]]'', on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], Rossiter played Rigsby, the lecherous [[landlord]] of a house converted into seedy [[bedsit]]s, reprising the role from the successful stage version, ''The Banana Box''. While he was in ''Rising Damp'' he also took the lead role in ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'', adapted by [[David Nobbs]] from his own  comic novels and broadcast on the BBC. Rossiter was given a surprise tribute on ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Rossiter revels in Rising Damp|quote=Having Rossiter in the part, incidentally, is all down to a former girlfriend who is called Ida. She was in an amateur group and when the young Rossiter watched her at rehearsals he told her he thought he could do better. 'I suppose you could do better!' she snapped. 'I couldn't do worse,' he said. So he joined the group. When 'This Is Your Life' descended on Rossiter who do you think was one of the surprise guests? That's right. Ida.|date=7 November 1975|newspaper=[[TVTimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in ''I Tell You It’s Burt Reynolds'', an episode of the 1977 [[Yorkshire Television]] series ''The Galton &amp; Simpson Playhouse'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonard Rossiter: a conviction in comedy|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/leonard-rossiter-conviction-comedy|author=Gary Mills|date= 4 March 2015|website=British Film Institute|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the short films ''The Waterloo Bridge Handicap'' (1978), and the [[Galton and Simpson]]-scripted ''[[Le Pétomane (film)|Le Pétomane]]'' (1979). After his portrayal of Reginald Perrin, Rossiter's non-comedy roles on television became less frequent, although there were exceptions such as a debt collector in the one-off [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] thriller ''Machinegunner'' (1976), and [[Frank Harris]] in ''Fearless Frank, or Tit-bits from the Life of an Adventurer'' (1978), a BBC ''Play of the Week''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rossiter, Leonard (1926-1984)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/839917/index.html|website=BFI Screenonline|author=John Oliver|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978–83, Rossiter performed in ten commercials for [[Cinzano]]. The iconic series of adverts was created by film director [[Alan Parker]] and, at Rossiter's suggestion, used an old music hall joke where he spills a drink over his wife (played by [[Joan Collins]]). In the [[Channel 4]] programme ''[[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|The 100 Greatest TV Ads]]'' (2000) Terry Lovelock, the director of two of the commercials, said that Rossiter used to refer jokingly to Collins as &quot;The Prop&quot;.&lt;ref name=telegraphreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardrossiter.com/Cinzano.html The Cinzano commercials, LeonardRossiter.com]. Retrieved 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter reprised Rigsby for a [[Rising Damp (film)|film version of ''Rising Damp'']] in 1980, thus achieving the distinction of playing the same role on stage, television and film. His last television role was as the [[supermarket]] manager in another ITV sitcom, ''[[Tripper's Day]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Rossiter's hated hair apparent|last=Knowles|first=Stewart|quote=When I was offered Tripper, it was pointed out that it wasn't terribly deep stuff, just smash-bang basic comedy in short, sharp scenes.  I said I wasn't averse to doing anything if I liked it, and this is fast and funny, very well written by Brian Cooke.|date=22 September 1984|newspaper=[[TVTimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to make a steady stream of film appearances, including a role in [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s ''[[Britannia Hospital]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Utting|first=David|title=Mr. Rossiter is anxious not to bore the kids|date=23 November 1981|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter also played the title role in the ''[[BBC Television Shakespeare]]'' production of ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'' (1984). His last film appearance was in ''[[Water (1985 film)|Water]]'' (1985).

==Radio and voice work==
In the animated adaptation of ''[[The Perishers]]'' (1979), Rossiter provided the voice for [[The Perishers#Boot|Boot the dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Perishers have Rossiter|date=15 March 1979|newspaper=[[The Stage|The Stage and Television Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He narrated an [[abridged]] version of the [[Charles Dickens]] book ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which was released on cassette in 1979. He appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Island Discs: Leonard Rossiter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mwc2|date=12 April 1980|website=[[BBC Radio 4]]|accessdate=29 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he narrated a seven-part series of five-minute episodes, written by [[Barry Pilton]] for BBC Radio 4, titled ''In a Nutshell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonard Rossiter - In a Nutshell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sjqty/episodes/guide|date=1981|website=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=1 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossiter narrated a three-part series of the children's story ''Harlequin and Columbine'' for ''[[Story Teller (magazine)|Story Teller]]'' magazine in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Story Teller 2|url=https://storytellerwebsite.wordpress.com/the-collection/story-teller-2/|website=Story Teller Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] in two episodes of [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]]'s version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice In Wonderland]]'', which was broadcast in April 1985, six months after Rossiter's death.

==Writing==
Rossiter displayed his acid wit in two books: ''The Devil's Bedside Book'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Rossiter, ''Devil's Bedside Book'', Littlehampton: 1980; {{ISBN|0-600-20105-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of cynical dictionary definitions in the style of [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'', and ''The Lowest Form of Wit'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lowest Form of Wit|first=Leonard|last=Rossiter|isbn=0-7221-7513-2|publisher=Michael Joseph Ltd.|year=1981|place=Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of biting [[bon mot|bons mots]], stinging retorts, and insults divided into six main sections, illustrated with cartoons by Honeysett and including a definitive guide and a history of sarcasm.

==Personal life==
Rossiter's first marriage was to the actress [[Josephine Tewson]], with whom he had worked many times in [[repertory theatre]] in the 1950s. The marriage ended in divorce in 1961. His second wife was the actress [[Gillian Raine]], with whom he had a daughter, Camilla, and to whom he was still married at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Remembrances, includes many pictures with Raine and his daughter|url=http://www.leonardrossiter.com/Personal.html|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossiter had met Gillian Raine when he played the lead role of Fred Midway in [[David Turner (dramatist)|David Turner]]'s play ''[[Semi-Detached (play)|Semi-Detached]]'', in a production directed by [[Tony Richardson]]. The play opened on 8 June 1962 at the [[Belgrade Theatre]] in [[Coventry]] and ran for a week. During the play's second run at the Belgrade, in September 1963, the couple fell in love and moved in together, but they did not marry until 1972.&lt;ref name = &quot;Personal2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Remembrances, includes many pictures with Raine in Semi-Detached|url=http://www.leonardrossiter.com/SemiDetached.html|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossiter was an [[Everton F.C.]] fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/nostalgia/pictures-remembering-leonard-rossiter-one-7881563|title=Pics and video: Remembering Leonard Rossiter|last=Macdonald|first=Neil|date=2014-10-04|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The joke that led Leonard Rossiter to stardom...and Rigsby|last=Knight|first=Val|quote=Of course I'm an Evertonian by tradition and so is my family.

After his death it was revealed that during the early 1980s Rossiter had had a five-year relationship with the broadcaster [[Sue MacGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Woman of Today|first=Sue|last=MacGregor|isbn=0-7472-4989-X|publisher=Headline Book Publishing|year=2002|place=London|pages=194–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife had not been aware of the affair until she received a letter from MacGregor breaking the news that her memoirs, which were about to be published, would include an account of the affair.&lt;ref name=telegraphreview/&gt;

==Death==
On 5 October 1984, Rossiter died from [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] while waiting to go onstage at the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]], [[London]], where he was performing in [[Joe Orton]]'s play ''[[Loot (play)|Loot]]''.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author=Shawn G.

They had better be professional in Paradise.  Because, if not, they'll certainly hear about it from Leonard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy Rules: From the Cambridge Footlights to Yes Prime Minister|first=Jonathan|last=Lynn|isbn=978-0571277957|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|year=2011|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and tributes==
Rossiter was posthumously nominated for a [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for &quot;Comedy Performance of the Year,&quot; for his role as Inspector Truscott in ''Loot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rossiter in line for 'Larry' award|date=29 November 1984|newspaper=[[The Stage]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the book ''Leonard Rossiter'' by author [[Robert Tanitch]] was published.  The book featured a collection of rare photos and reminiscences from friends and colleagues of Rossiter's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanitch|first=Robert|title=Leonard Rossiter|year=1985|publisher=Robert Royce Ltd|isbn=0-947728-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonard Rossiter|url=http://www.tanitch.co.uk/books/rossiter.htm|publisher=www.tanitch.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] biography series ''[[The Unforgettable]]'' broadcast an episode about Rossiter's life.  His wife and daughter were interviewed, as well as former colleagues, including [[Don Warrington]], [[Joan Collins]], and [[Sue Nicholls]].

A biography of Rossiter, titled ''Leonard Rossiter:  Character Driven'' was published in 2010 by author Guy Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Guy|title=Leonard Rossiter: Character Driven|year=2010|isbn=978-1-84513-596-6|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphreview/&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}
In [[cryptography]], a '''substitution cipher''' is a method of [[encrypting]] in which units of [[plaintext]] are replaced with [[ciphertext]], according to a fixed system; the &quot;units&quot; may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.

Substitution ciphers can be compared with [[transposition cipher]]s. In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.

There are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a '''simple substitution cipher'''; a cipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed '''polygraphic'''. A '''monoalphabetic cipher''' uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a '''polyalphabetic cipher''' uses a number of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.

==Simple substitution==
[[Image:ROT13.png|thumb|300px|right|[[ROT13]] is a [[Caesar cipher]], a type of substitution cipher. In ROT13, the alphabet is rotated 13 steps.]]

Substitution of single letters separately—'''simple substitution'''—can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet in some order to represent the substitution. This is termed a '''substitution alphabet'''. The cipher alphabet may be shifted or reversed (creating the [[Caesar cipher|Caesar]] and [[Atbash]] ciphers, respectively) or scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a ''mixed alphabet'' or ''deranged alphabet''. Traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order.

Using this system, the keyword &quot;&lt;tt&gt;zebras&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; gives us the following alphabets:
{|
|''[[Plaintext]] alphabet:''
| &lt;tt&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
|''[[Ciphertext]] alphabet:''
| &lt;tt&gt;ZEBRASCDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

Usually the ciphertext is written out in blocks of fixed length, omitting punctuation and spaces; this is done to disguise word boundaries from the [[plaintext]] and to help avoid transmission errors. These blocks are called &quot;groups&quot;, and sometimes a &quot;group count&quot; (i.e. the number of groups) is given as an additional check. Five-letter groups are often used, dating from when messages used to be transmitted by [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]:

If the length of the message happens not to be divisible by five, it may be padded at the end with &quot;[[Null character|null]]s&quot;. These can be any characters that decrypt to obvious nonsense, so that the receiver can easily spot them and discard them.

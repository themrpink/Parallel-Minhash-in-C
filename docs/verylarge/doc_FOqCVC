'''Pluto''' ([[minor planet designation]]: '''134340 Pluto''') is a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[Kuiper belt]], a ring of [[trans-Neptunian object|bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune]]. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.
After Pluto was discovered in 1930 it was declared to be the [[Planets beyond Neptune|ninth planet]] from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a [[planet]] was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt, including the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]. This led the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 2006 to formally [[IAU definition of planet|define the term &quot;planet&quot;]] — excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.

Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the [[Moon]] and one-third its volume. It has a moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s or AU (4.4–7.4&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]], but a stable [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5&amp;nbsp;AU).

Pluto has [[moons of Pluto|five known moons]]: [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]]. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a [[binary system]] because the [[barycenter]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.

The ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft performed a [[planetary flyby|flyby]] of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first and, to date, only spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of [[tholin]]s, [[organic compound|organic]] [[macromolecule]]s that may be ingredients for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]], and produced from [[methane]], [[nitrogen]] and other gases released from the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] and transferred {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the orbiting moon.

[[File:Clyde W. Tombaugh.jpeg|left|thumb|upright|Clyde Tombaugh, in Kansas]]
In the 1840s, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] used [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet [[Neptune]] after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of [[Uranus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |first=Ken |last=Croswell |location=New York |publisher=The Free Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-684-83252-4 |page=43 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.

In 1906, [[Percival Lowell]]—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed &quot;[[Planet X]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tombaugh1946&quot; /&gt; By 1909, Lowell and [[William Henry Pickering|William H. Pickering]] had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt&quot; /&gt; Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Littman1990&quot; /&gt; There are fourteen other known [[precovery]] observations, with the earliest made by the [[Yerkes Observatory]] on August 20, 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuchwaldDimarioWild2000&quot; /&gt;

Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}} [[Vesto Melvin Slipher]], the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}}

Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=52}} After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on March 13, 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt&quot; /&gt; Pluto has yet to complete a full orbit of the Sun since its discovery, as one Plutonian year is 247.68 years long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/feature/11-awesome-facts-about-the-lovable-dwarf-planet-pluto-1629287/|title=11 awesome facts about Pluto that you probably don't know|date=2015-07-24|website=Geek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
[[File:NH-Pluto-Day1-TenImages-20150714-20151120.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of best-resolution images of Pluto from different angles]]
The discovery made headlines around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;For example: &quot;Ninth Planet Discovered on Edge of Solar System: First Found in 84 Years&quot;. ''Associated Press''. The New York Times. March 14, 1930. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell Observatory, which had the right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto guide&quot; /&gt; Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did.&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto guide&quot; /&gt; Constance Lowell proposed ''[[Zeus]]'', then ''Percival'' and finally ''Constance''. These suggestions were disregarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mager&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- self-published source --&gt;

The name Pluto, after the Roman [[Pluto (mythology)|god of the underworld]], was proposed by [[Venetia Burney]] (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in [[Oxford]], England, who was interested in [[classical mythology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetia&quot; /&gt; She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather [[Falconer Madan]], a former librarian at the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian Library]], who passed the name to astronomy professor [[Herbert Hall Turner]], who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetia&quot; /&gt;

Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three potential names: [[Minerva]] (which was already the name for an asteroid), [[Cronus]] (which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]]), and Pluto. Pluto received a unanimous vote.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|pp=54–55}} The name was announced on May 1, 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pluto Research at Lowell |url=https://lowell.edu/in-depth/pluto/pluto-research-at-lowell/ |website=Lowell Observatory |accessdate=March 22, 2017 |quote=In a Lowell Observatory Circular dated May 1, 1930, the Observatory designated Pluto as the name for the new planet, based on the suggestion of 11-year-old Venetia Burney of England. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418140312/http://lowell.edu/in-depth/pluto/pluto-research-at-lowell/ |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia £5 (equivalent to {{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5|1930|2014|r=-2}}}} [[GBP]], or 450 [[USD]] in 2014){{Inflation-fn|UK}} as a reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetia&quot; /&gt;

The final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of ''Pluto'' are the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto's [[astronomical symbol]] {{nowrap|([[File:Pluto symbol.svg|20px]],}} [[Unicode]] U+2647, ♇) was then created as a [[monogram]] constructed from the letters &quot;PL&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPL/NASA Pluto's Symbol&quot; /&gt; Pluto's [[astrological symbol]] resembles that of Neptune {{nowrap|([[File:Neptune symbol.svg|20px]])}}, but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident {{nowrap|([[File:Pluto's astrological symbol.svg|20px]])}}.

The name was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, [[Walt Disney]] was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for [[Mickey Mouse]] a canine companion named [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], although [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animator [[Ben Sharpsteen]] could not confirm why the name was given.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heinrichs2006&quot; /&gt; In 1941, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] named the newly created [[Chemical element|element]] [[plutonium]] after Pluto, in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets, following [[uranium]], which was named after Uranus, and [[neptunium]], which was named after Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkHobart2000&quot; /&gt;

Most languages use the name &quot;Pluto&quot; in various transliterations.{{efn|The equivalence is less close in languages whose [[phonology]] differs widely from [[Ancient Greek phonology|Greek's]], such as [[Somali language|Somali]] ''Buluuto'' and [[Navajo language|Navajo]] ''Tłóotoo''.}} In Japanese, [[Houei Nojiri]] suggested the translation {{nihongo3|&quot;Star of the King (God) of the Underworld&quot;|冥王星|Meiōsei}}, and this was borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese (which instead uses &quot;Sao Diêm Vương&quot;, which was derived from the Chinese term 閻王 ([[Yama (East Asia)|Yánwáng]]), as &quot;minh&quot; is a homophone for the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] words for &quot;dark&quot; (冥) and &quot;bright&quot; (明)).&lt;ref name=&quot;RenshawIhara2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nineplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathrobe&quot; /&gt; Some [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] use the name Pluto, but others, such as [[Hindi]], use the name of ''[[Yama]]'', the God of Death in [[Hindu]] and [[Yama (East Asia)|Buddhist]] mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineplan&quot; /&gt; [[Polynesian languages]] also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld, as in [[Māori language|Māori]] ''[[Whiro]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineplan&quot; /&gt;

=== Planet X disproved ===
Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's [[planets beyond Neptune|Planet X]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tombaugh1946&quot; /&gt; Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stern|first1 = Alan|last2 = Tholen|first2 = David James|title = Pluto and Charon|date = 1997|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn = 978-0-8165-1840-1|pages=206–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of [[Earth]], with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson et al 1930&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuiper 10.1086/126255&quot; /&gt; In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the [[University of Hawaii]] calculated Pluto's [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=57}} (Pluto's albedo is {{nowrap|1.4–1.9}} times that of Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pluto Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt;)

In 1978, the discovery of Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by [[Robert Sutton Harrington]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SeidelmannHarrington1988&quot; /&gt; failed. In 1992, [[E. Myles Standish|Myles Standish]] used data from ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standish1993&quot; /&gt; Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standage2000&quot; /&gt; Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; [[Ernest W. Brown]] concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tenn1994&quot; /&gt;

{{Further|Definition of planet}}
{{TNO imagemap}}
There are two primary definitions of 'planet'. Disregarding the often inconsistent technical details, they are whether a body ''acts'' like a planet (e.g. its orbit and relationship to other bodies) or whether it ''looks'' like a planet (e.g. whether it has planetary geology). Pluto meets the second definition but not the first.

From 1992 onward, many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the [[Kuiper belt]]. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. In February 2000 the [[Hayden Planetarium]] in New York City displayed a Solar System model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyson2001&quot; /&gt;

[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] lost their planet status after the discovery of many other [[asteroid]]s. Similarly, objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the Kuiper belt region. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at [[Caltech]] announced the discovery of a new [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the [[tenth planet]], although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-JPL press release 07-29-2005&quot; /&gt; Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What Is a Planet? |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=2513–2519 |date=November 2, 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |last1 = Soter|first1 = Steven|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 |s2cid=14676169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== IAU classification ====

{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}

The debate came to a head in August 2006, with an [[IAU definition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term &quot;planet&quot;. According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the [[Solar System]] to be considered a planet:
# The object must be in orbit around the [[Sun]].
# The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].
# It must have [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighborhood]] around its orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU2006 GA26-5-6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU0603&quot; /&gt;
Pluto fails to meet the third condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margot2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margot|first1=Jean-Luc|title=A Quantitative Criterion for Defining Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|year=2015|pages=185 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M|arxiv=1507.06300|s2cid=51684830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mass is substantially less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times, in contrast to Earth, which is 1.7&amp;nbsp;million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon).&lt;ref name=&quot;what&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU0603&quot; /&gt; The IAU further decided that bodies that, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2, but do not meet criterion 3 would be called [[dwarf planet]]s. In September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and Eris and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]], in their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]], giving them the official [[minor planet designation]]s &quot;(134340) Pluto&quot;, &quot;(136199) Eris&quot;, and &quot;(136199) Eris I Dysnomia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAUC 8747&quot; /&gt; Had Pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930, it would have likely been designated 1164, following [[1163 Saga]], which was discovered a month earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification.&lt;ref name=&quot;geoff2006c&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruibal-1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britt-2006&quot; /&gt; [[Alan Stern]], principal investigator with [[NASA]]'s ''New Horizons'' mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that &quot;the definition stinks, for technical reasons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;geoff2006a&quot; /&gt; Stern contended that, by the terms of the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientistspace&quot; /&gt; He argued that all big spherical moons, including the [[Moon]], should likewise be considered planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;News.discovery.com&quot; /&gt; He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientistspace&quot; /&gt; [[Marc W. Buie]], then at the Lowell Observatory, petitioned against the definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buie2006 IAU response&quot; /&gt; Others have supported the IAU. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the astronomer who discovered Eris, said &quot;through this whole crazy, circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. It's been a long time coming. Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Overbye2006&quot; /&gt;

Public reception to the IAU decision was mixed. A resolution introduced in the [[California State Assembly]] facetiously called the IAU decision a &quot;scientific heresy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeVore2006&quot; /&gt; The [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] passed a resolution in honor of Tombaugh, a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holden2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutierrez2007&quot; /&gt; The [[Illinois Senate]] passed a similar resolution in 2009, on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was &quot;unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet&quot; by the IAU.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ILGA SR0046&quot; /&gt; Some members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapa-AP&quot; /&gt;

In 2006, in its 17th annual words-of-the-year vote, the [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''[[plutoed]]'' as the word of the year. To &quot;pluto&quot; is to &quot;demote or devalue someone or something&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt;

Researchers on both sides of the debate gathered in August 2008, at the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] for a conference that included back-to-back talks on the current IAU definition of a planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minkel2008&quot; /&gt; Entitled &quot;The Great Planet Debate&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Planet Debate&quot; /&gt; the conference published a post-conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about the definition of planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSIedu press release 2008-09-19&quot; /&gt; In June 2008, the IAU had announced in a press release that the term &quot;[[plutoid]]&quot; would henceforth be used to refer to Pluto and other planetary-mass objects that have an orbital [[semi-major axis]] greater than that of Neptune, though the term has not seen significant use.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU0804&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Discover 2009-JANp76&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Science News, July 5, 2008 p. 7&quot; /&gt;

== Orbit ==
{{wide image|Pluto skypath 1900-2050.png|900px|Pluto was discovered in 1930 near the star [[Delta Geminorum|δ Geminorum]], and merely coincidentally crossing the [[ecliptic]] at this time of discovery. Pluto moves about 7 degrees east per decade with small [[apparent retrograde motion]] as seen from Earth. Pluto was closer to the Sun than Neptune between 1979 and 1999.}}
[[File:Animation of Pluto orbit.gif|thumb|225px|Animation of Pluto{{'s}} orbit from 1900 to 2100&lt;br /&gt;{{legend2|Yellow| Sun}}{{·}}{{legend2|Gold | Saturn}}{{·}}{{legend2|Cyan | Uranus}}{{·}}{{legend2| RoyalBlue | Neptune}}{{·}}{{legend2|Magenta| Pluto}}]]
Pluto's orbital period is currently about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]]. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to [[apsis|perihelion]] on September 5, 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;jpl-ssd-horizons&quot; /&gt;{{efn|name = Perihelion}} and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto990209&quot; /&gt;

In the long term, Pluto's orbit is [[chaos theory|chaotic]]. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[time reversibility|forward and backward]] in time), but after intervals longer than the [[Lyapunov time]] of 10–20&amp;nbsp;million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;sussman88&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisdom91&quot; /&gt;

The [[semi-major axis]] of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|au]] with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.&lt;ref name=williams71 /&gt;

}}

=== Relationship with Neptune ===
Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.

The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.&lt;ref name=&quot;huainn01&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter2004&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;malhotra-9planets&quot; /&gt;

This alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its [[apsidal precession|orbital precession]]) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Neptune]]: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near [[perihelion]], Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17&amp;nbsp;AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11&amp;nbsp;AU).&lt;ref name=&quot;malhotra-9planets&quot; /&gt; The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.&lt;ref name=williams71 /&gt;

The 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;sp-345&quot; /&gt; This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.&lt;ref name=&quot;malhotra-9planets&quot; /&gt; The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune, its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to [[Kepler's third law]]. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto's orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;malhotra-9planets&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sp-345&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen_Hubbard_1965&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=C. J.|last2=Hubbard|first2=E.

==== Other factors ====
Numerical studies have shown that over millions of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change.&lt;ref name=&quot;huainn01&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;williams71&quot; /&gt; There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).

First, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90°.&lt;ref name=&quot;williams71&quot; /&gt; This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;huainn01&quot; /&gt; which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° {{nowrap|(90°–38°)}}. The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;sp-345&quot; /&gt;

Second, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies—the points where they cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''. All the [[Jovian planets]], particularly Jupiter, play a role in the creation of the superresonance.&lt;ref name=&quot;huainn01&quot; /&gt;

=== Quasi-satellite ===
In 2012, it was hypothesized that [[15810 Arawn]] could be a [[quasi-satellite]] of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration.&lt;ref name=&quot;quasi&quot; /&gt; According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;quasi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot; /&gt; Measurements made by the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of Arawn more accurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016maynasa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=New Horizons Collects First Science on a Post-Pluto Object|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-collects-first-science-on-a-post-pluto-object|publisher=NASA|date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These calculations confirm the overall dynamics described in the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;analemma&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The analemma criterion: accidental quasi-satellites are indeed true quasi-satellites |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/27/mnras.stw1833.abstract |first1=Carlos |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Raúl |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2016 |volume=462 |issue=3 |pages=3344–3349 |arxiv=1607.06686 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw1833 |bibcode=2016MNRAS.462.3344D|s2cid=119284843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether Arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of Pluto based on this motion, since its orbit is primarily controlled by Neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by Pluto.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter_et_al_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The First High-phase Observations of a KBO: New Horizons Imaging of (15810) 1994 JR1 from the Kuiper Belt |first=Simon B. |last=Porter |display-authors=etal |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=828 |issue=2 |pages=L15 |date=2016 |arxiv=1605.05376 |bibcode=2016ApJ...828L..15P |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/828/2/L15|s2cid=54507506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2016maynasa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=analemma /&gt;

== Rotation ==
Pluto's [[rotation period]], its day, is equal to 6.387 [[Earth]] days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pluto Fact Sheet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;axis&quot; /&gt; Like [[Uranus]], Pluto rotates on its &quot;side&quot; in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its [[solstice]]s, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;oregon&quot; /&gt; The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the [[University of Arizona]] has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called ''[[polar wander]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kirschvink|first1=Joseph L.|last2=Ripperdan|first2=Robert L.|last3=Evans|first3=David A.|date=July 25, 1997|title=Evidence for a Large-Scale Reorganization of Early Cambrian Continental Masses by Inertial Interchange True Polar Wander|journal=Science|language=en|volume=277|issue=5325|pages=541–545|doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.541|s2cid=177135895|issn=0036-8075|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79e3cd0b46dda1485700e37ab6ec887fda31e2b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a paper released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorient itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto's vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to {{convert|-240|C|F K}}, causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth were the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] several times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=James T.|last2=Matsuyama|first2=Isamu|last3=Kamata|first3=Shunichi|last4=Steckloff|first4=Jordan K.|title=Reorientation and faulting of Pluto due to volatile loading within Sputnik Planitia|journal=Nature|volume=540|issue=7631|pages=90–93|doi=10.1038/nature20120|pmid=27851731|bibcode = 2016Natur.540...90K |year=2016|s2cid=4468636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto's density is {{val|1.860|0.013|u=g/cm3}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stern2015&quot; /&gt; Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense [[Core (geology)|core]] surrounded by a [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] of water ice. The pre–''New Horizons'' estimate for the diameter of the core {{val|1700|u=km}}, 70% of Pluto's diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hussmann2006&quot; /&gt; It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a [[subsurface ocean]] of liquid water {{nowrap|100 to 180 km}} thick at the core–mantle boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hussmann2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pluto.jhuapl Inside Story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name='Sci Am 2017'&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/overlooked-ocean-worlds-fill-the-outer-solar-system/ Overlooked Ocean Worlds Fill the Outer Solar System].

Pluto's diameter is {{val|2376.6|3.2|u=km}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmo2017&quot; /&gt; and its mass is {{val|1.303|0.003|e=22|u=kg}}, 17.7% that of the [[Moon]] (0.22% that of Earth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies2001&quot; /&gt; Its [[surface area]] is {{val|1.779|e=7|u=km2}}, or roughly the same surface area as [[Russia]]. Its [[surface gravity]] is 0.063 ''g'' (compared to 1 ''g'' for Earth and 0.17 ''g'' for the Moon).

The discovery of Pluto's satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] in 1978 enabled a determination of the mass of the Pluto–Charon system by application of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Deriving Kepler's third law|Newton's formulation of Kepler's third law]]. Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto's diameter more accurately, whereas the invention of [[adaptive optics]] allowed them to determine its shape more accurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Close_2000&quot; /&gt;

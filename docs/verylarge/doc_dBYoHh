Increasing drug use also affected Bruce's health. By 1966, he had been blacklisted by nearly every nightclub in the U.S., as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. He gave a famous performance at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]] in December 1965, which was recorded and became his last live album, titled ''The Berkeley Concert''; his performance here has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with Frank Zappa and [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnZ0qL3QdkgC&amp;q=%22whacked+out+on+amphetamines%22&amp;pg=PA159 | title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=2004 | access-date=November 18, 2014 |author1=Graham, Bill | author1-link = Bill Graham (promoter)|author2=Greenfield, Robert| author2-link =Robert Greenfield| page=156 | isbn=978-0306813498}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was not remembered fondly by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], whose memoir describes Bruce as &quot;whacked out on [[amphetamines|amphetamine]];&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed.

At the request of Hefner and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote an [[autobiography]].

==Death and posthumous pardon==
[[File:LennyBruce Grave.JPG|thumb|Bruce's grave at [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]]]]
On August 3, 1966, a bearded Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [[Hollywood Hills]] home at 8825 W. Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Obituary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|access-date=November 28, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1966|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011015200417/https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|archive-date=October 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official photo, taken at the scene, showed Bruce lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other [[narcotic]]s paraphernalia. Record producer [[Phil Spector]], a friend of Bruce, bought the negatives of the photographs &quot;to keep them from the press.&quot; The official cause of death was &quot;acute [[morphine]] poisoning caused by an overdose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon|last1=Collins|first1=Ronald|last2=Skover|first2=David|year=2002|publisher=Sourcebooks Mediafusion|isbn=978-1-57071-986-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/trialsoflennybru00coll/page/340 340]|url=https://archive.org/details/trialsoflennybru00coll/page/340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce's remains were interred in [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]], but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. Over 500 people came to the service to pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials had tried to block the ceremony after advertisements for the event encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. [[Dick Schaap]] eulogized Bruce in ''Playboy'', with the last line: &quot;One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. ''That's'' obscene&quot;.

His epitaph reads: &quot;Beloved father – devoted son / Peace at last.&quot;

Bruce had one daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Honey Bruce Friedman, 78, Entertainer and 'Lenny's Shady Lady'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/arts/20friedman.html|work=New York Times|date=September 20, 2005|page=A27|access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{cite news |author=O'Malley, Ryan |url=http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Lenny_Bruce_rsquo_s_daughter_reaching_out_10-04-2009.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123024059/http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Lenny_Bruce_rsquo_s_daughter_reaching_out_10-04-2009.html |archive-date=November 23, 2011 |title=Lenny Bruce's daughter reaching out: Pittston resident Kitty Bruce hopes to help women in recovery with &quot;Lenny's House&quot;|newspaper=Pittston Dispatch|location=[[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] |access-date=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, his girlfriend was comedian [[Lotus Weinstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Weide, Bob.

| quote = {{spaces|4}}Perhaps the most profound and cataclysmic change in our popular culture the last few years—matching the &quot;new sound&quot; in music—has been the kind of humor exemplified by the [[Smothers Brothers]], ''[[Laugh-In]]'', [[Woody Allen]], and that whole breed, whose secret source of strength was the late dark angel, Lenny Bruce.
&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|4}}Bruce was the [[Gertrude Stein]] of comedians. Never popular himself—because he was too cryptic and too scatological for popular taste—he nevertheless influenced a whole generation of comics, just as Stein influenced Hemingway and that generation of writers. Her own work was a dead end (so was Bruce's), but out of that compost grew the buds of a flourishing school.|source = {{right|—syndicated columnist [[Sydney J. Harris]], November 5, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sydney J. ''Rochester Democrat and Chronicle'', November 5, 1969, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Bruce was the subject of the 1974 biographical film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'', directed by [[Bob Fosse]] and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award-nominated Best Actor]] role), and based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage play of the same name written by [[Julian Barry]] and starring [[Cliff Gorman]] in his 1972 [[Tony Award]]-winning role. In addition, the main character's editing of a fictionalized film version of ''Lenny'' was a major part of Fosse's own autobiopic, the 1979 Academy Award-nominated ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''; Gorman again played the role of the stand-up comic.

The documentary ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth'', directed by [[Robert B. Weide]] and narrated by [[Robert De Niro]], was released in 1998. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] listed Bruce at number three on its list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time, placing above Woody Allen (4th) and below Richard Pryor (1st) and George Carlin (2nd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time |title=List of Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time |publisher=listology.com |access-date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both comedians who ranked higher than Bruce considered him a major influence; Pryor said that hearing Bruce for the first time &quot;changed my life,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/richard-pryor/news/pryor.-i-owe-it-all-to-lenny-bruce|title=Pryor: I Owe It All To Lenny Bruce|date=May 21, 2004|work=Contactmusic.com|access-date=April 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carlin was arrested along with Bruce after refusing to provide identification when police raided a Bruce performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|season=2|number=10|episode-link=List of Bullshit! episodes|series-link=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|airdate=August 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the emotion}}
'''Hope''' is an [[Optimism|optimistic]] state of mind that is based on an [[wikt:expectation|expectation]] of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one's life or the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hope |title=Hope &amp;#124; Define Hope at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1992-11-27 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a verb, its definitions include: &quot;expect with confidence&quot; and &quot;to cherish a desire with anticipation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hope |title=Hope – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its opposites are dejection, [[Hopelessness scale|hopelessness]], and [[Depression (mood)|despair]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed., ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1995) pp.  852–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==

Professor of Psychology [[Barbara Fredrickson]] argues that hope comes into its own when crisis looms, opening us to new creative possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Fredrickson |first=Barbara L. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positivity/200903/why-choose-hope |title=Why Choose Hope? |magazine=Psychology Today |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederickson argues that with great need comes an unusually wide range of ideas, as well as such positive emotions as happiness and joy, courage, and empowerment, drawn from four different areas of one's self: from a cognitive, psychological, social, or physical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fredrickson, Barbara L., et al. (2008)|title=Open Hearts Build Lives: Positive Emotions, Induced Through Loving-Kindness Meditation, Build Consequential Personal Resources|publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 95, pp. 1045–1062|url=http://psycnet.apa.org.suproxy.su.edu/journals/psp/95/5/1045.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopeful people are &quot;like the little engine that could, [because] they keep telling themselves &quot;I think I can, I think I can&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php |title=Mental Health, Depression, Anxiety, Wellness, Family &amp; Relationship Issues, Sexual Disorders &amp; ADHD Medications |publisher=Mentalhelp.net |accessdate=2012-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211327/http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php |archivedate=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[Optimism|positive thinking]] bears fruit when based on a realistic sense of optimism, not on a naive &quot;false hope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996)  p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Charles R. Snyder]] linked hope to the existence of a goal, combined with a determined plan for reaching that goal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=28966&amp;cn=110 |title=Breaking down Barack Obama's Psychology of Hope and how it may help you in trying times… – Wellness, Disease Prevention, And Stress Reduction Information |publisher=Mentalhelp.net |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110102512/http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=28966&amp;cn=110 |archivedate=November 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] had similarly argued for the centrality of goal-seeking in human psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt; as too had philosophical anthropologists like [[Ernst Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder also stressed the link between hope and mental willpower, as well as the need for realistic perception of goals,&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D.  The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the difference between hope and optimism was that the former included practical pathways to an improved future.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D.  The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Winnicott]] saw a child's antisocial behavior as expressing an unconscious hope{{elucidate|date=August 2015}} for management by the wider society, when containment within the immediate family had failed.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) pp. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory]] similarly sees the analytic [[transference]] as motivated in part by an unconscious hope that past conflicts and traumas can be dealt with anew.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hope theory===
As a specialist in [[positive psychology]], Snyder studied how hope and forgiveness can impact several aspects of life such as health, work, education, and personal meaning. He postulated that there are three main things that make up hopeful thinking:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teachingpsychology.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/hope-theory.pdf |title=Hope Theory |website=Teachingpsychology.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Goals – Approaching life in a goal-oriented way.
* Pathways – Finding different ways to achieve your goals.
* Agency – Believing that you can instigate change and achieve these goals.

[[File:Auschwitz-hope after terror.jpg|thumbnail|left|A rose expressing hope, at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]]]

In other words, hope was defined as the perceived capability to derive pathways to desired goals and motivate oneself via agency thinking to use those pathways.

Snyder argues that individuals who are able to realize these three components and develop a belief in their ability are hopeful people who can establish clear goals, imagine multiple workable pathways toward those goals, and persevere, even when obstacles get in their way. 

Snyder proposed a &quot;Hope Scale&quot; which considered that a person's determination to achieve their goal is their measured hope. Snyder differentiates between adult-measured hope and child-measured hope. The Adult Hope Scale by Snyder contains 12 questions; 4 measuring 'pathways thinking', 4 measuring 'agency thinking', and 4 that are simply fillers.  Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C. R., Rand, K. L., &amp; Sigmon, D. R. (2002). Hope Theory: A Member of the Positive Psychology Family. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 257–276). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fibel and Hale measure hope by combining Snyder's Hope Scale with their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missouriwestern.edu/psychology/research/psy302/spring97/teresa_hunt.html |title=Self-concept, Hope and Achievement: A look at the relationship between the individual self-concept, level of hope, and academic achievement |publisher=Missouriwestern.edu |date=1997-05-01 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128043439/http://www.missouriwestern.edu/psychology/research/psy302/spring97/teresa_hunt.html |archivedate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one's goals, drawing on [[tacit knowledge]] of how to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Charles D., ''The Psychology of Hope: You Can Get Here from There''.  New York: The Free Press, 1994, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is an ''outlook'' and a ''grasp of reality'' to hope, distinguishing '''No Hope''', '''Lost Hope''', '''False Hope''' and '''Real Hope''', which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/hope.htm|title=Emotional Competency - Hope|website=www.emotionalcompetency.com|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] understands hope as more than [[goal setting]], rather as a [[metanarrative]], a story that serves as a promise or reason for expecting a better future. Rorty as [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] believes past meta–narratives, including the Christian story, utilitarianism, and [[Marxism]] have proved false hopes; that theory cannot offer social hope; and that liberal man must learn to live without a consensual theory of social hope.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Hall, ''Richard Rorty'' (1994) p. 150 and p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty says a new document of promise is needed for social hope to exist again.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard. Philosophy and Social Hope.

=== Major theories ===
Of the countless models that examine the importance of hope in an individual's life, there are two major theories that have gained a significant amount of recognition in the field of [[psychology]]. One of these theories, developed by [[Charles R. Snyder]], argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive skill that demonstrates an individual's ability to maintain drive in the pursuit of a particular goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=C.R|title=The Psychology of Hope|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofhope00snyd|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Free Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model reasons that an individual's ability to be hopeful depends on two types of thinking: agency thinking and pathway thinking. Agency thinking refers to an individual's determination to achieve their goals despite possible obstacles, while pathway thinking refers to the ways in which an individual believes they can achieve these personal goals.

Snyder's theory uses hope as a mechanism that is most often seen in [[psychotherapy]]. In these instances, the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals (i.e. &quot;I am going to find something I am passionate about and that makes me feel good about myself&quot;), and would help them remain hopeful of their ability to achieve these goals, and suggest the correct pathways to do so.

Whereas Snyder's theory focuses on hope as a mechanism to overcome an individual's lack of motivation to achieve goals, the other major theory developed by Kaye A. Herth deals more specifically with an individual's future goals as they relate to coping with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weis|first1=Robert|last2=Speridakos|first2=Elena|title=A Meta-Analysis of Hope Enhancement Strategies in Clinical and Community Setting|journal=Psychology of Well-Being: Theory, Research and Practice|date=2011|volume=1|page=5|doi=10.1186/2211-1522-1-5|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herth views hope as &quot;a motivational and cognitive attribute that is theoretically necessary to initiate and sustain action toward goal attainment&quot;.&lt;ref name=Herth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herth|first1=K.A.|title=Enhancing hope in people with a first recurrence of cancer|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|date=2000|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1431–1441|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01619.x|pmid=11136411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing realistic and attainable goals in this situation is more difficult, as the individual most likely does not have direct control over the future of their health. Instead, Herth suggests that the goals should be concerned with how the individual is going to personally deal with the illness—&quot;Instead of drinking to ease the pain of my illness, I am going to surround myself with friends and family&quot;.&lt;ref name=Herth /&gt;

While the nature of the goals in Snyder's model differ with those in Herth's model, they both view hope as a way to maintain personal motivation, which ultimately will result in a greater sense of optimism.

=== Major empirical findings ===
Hope, and more specifically, particularized hope, has been shown to be an important part of the recovery process from illness; it has strong psychological benefits for patients, helping them to cope more effectively with their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiles|first1=R.|last2=Cott|first2=C.|last3=Gibson|first3=B.E.|title=Hope, expectations, and recovery from illness: A narrative synthesis of qualitative research|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|date=2008|volume=64|issue=6|pages=564–573|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04815.x|pmid=19120569}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, hope motivates people to pursue healthy behaviors for recovery, such as eating fruits and vegetables, quitting smoking, and engaging in regular [[physical activity]]. This not only helps to enhance people's recovery from illnesses, but also helps prevent illness from developing in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enayati 2013&quot; /&gt; Patients who maintain high levels of hope have an improved prognosis for life-threatening illness and an enhanced quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonik|first1=T.|title=Reflections on hope and recovery|url=http://nedic.ca/|publisher=National Eating Disorder Information Centre|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Belief and expectation, which are key elements of hope, block pain in patients suffering from chronic illness by releasing endorphins and mimicking the effects of morphine. Consequently, through this process, belief and expectation can set off a chain reaction in the body that can make recovery from chronic illness more likely.  This chain reaction is especially evident with studies demonstrating the [[placebo effect]], a situation when hope is the only variable aiding in these patients’ recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enayati 2013&quot; /&gt;

Overall, studies have demonstrated that maintaining a sense of hope during a period of recovery from illness is beneficial. A sense of hopelessness during the recovery period has, in many instances, resulted in adverse health conditions for the patient (i.e. depression and anxiety following the recovery process).{{cn|date=March 2019}} Additionally, having a greater amount of hope before and during cognitive therapy has led to decreased PTSD-related depression symptoms in war veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2012&quot; /&gt; Hope has also been found to be associated with more positive perceptions of subjective health. However, reviews of research literature have noted that the connections between hope and symptom severity in other mental health disorders are less clear, such as in cases of individuals with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrank et al. 2008&quot; /&gt;

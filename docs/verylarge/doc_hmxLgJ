'''Europa''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-Europa.ogg|j|ʊ|ˈ|r|oʊ|p|ə}}, or '''Jupiter II''', is the smallest of the four [[Galilean moons]] orbiting [[Jupiter]], and the sixth-closest to the planet of all [[Moons of Jupiter#List|the 79 known moons of Jupiter]]. It is also the [[List of natural satellites|sixth-largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]]. Europa was discovered in 1610 by [[Galileo Galilei]]&lt;ref name=&quot;IAUMoonDiscoveries&quot;/&gt; and was named after [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], the [[Phoenicia]]n mother of King [[Minos]] of [[Crete]] and lover of [[Zeus]] (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]).

Slightly smaller than [[Moon|Earth's Moon]], Europa is primarily made of [[silicate]] rock and has a water-ice crust&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20150315&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Suddenly, It Seems, Water Is Everywhere in Solar System |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/science/space/suddenly-it-seems-water-is-everywhere-in-solar-system.html |date=12 March 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=13 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably an [[iron–nickel alloy|iron–nickel]] core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is [[Glacial striation|striated]] by cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.

Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the [[hypothesis]] that a [[subsurface ocean|water ocean exists beneath the surface]], which could conceivably harbor [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tritt2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.msoe.edu/~tritt/sf/europa.life.html |title=Possibility of Life on Europa |last=Tritt |first=Charles S. |accessdate=10 August 2007 |publisher=Milwaukee School of Engineering |date=2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609150109/http://people.msoe.edu/~tritt/sf/europa.life.html |archivedate=9 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant model suggests that heat from [[tidal flexing]] causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to [[plate tectonics]], absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.asu.edu/~glg_intro/planetary/p8.htm |title=Tidal Heating |work=geology.asu.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329000051/http://geology.asu.edu/~glg_intro/planetary/p8.htm |archivedate=29 March 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20140908&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dyches |first1=Preston |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Buckley |first3=Michael |title=Scientists Find Evidence of 'Diving' Tectonic Plates on Europa |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-300 |date=8 September 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=8 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor.

Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NA-20180514&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20180514&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20180514&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SP-20180514&quot; /&gt;

The ''Galileo'' mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions.

==Discovery and naming==
Europa, along with Jupiter's three other large moons, [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], was discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] on 8 January 1610,&lt;ref name=&quot;IAUMoonDiscoveries&quot;/&gt; and possibly independently by [[Simon Marius]]. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo on 7 January 1610 using a [[Galileo Telescope|20×-magnification refracting telescope]] at the [[University of Padua]]. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low magnification of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]), Io and Europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAUMoonDiscoveries&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Blue |first=Jennifer | date=9 November 2009 |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html |title=Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers | publisher=USGS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europa is the namesake of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], daughter of the king of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], a [[Phoenicia]]n noblewoman in [[Greek mythology]]. Like all the Galilean satellites, Europa is named after a lover of [[Zeus]], the Greek counterpart of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Europa was courted by Zeus and became the queen of [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nineplanets.org/europa.html |title=Europa |last=Arnett |first=Bill |work=Nine Planets |date=October 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming scheme was suggested by Simon Marius,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marius1614&quot;/&gt; who attributed the proposal to [[Johannes Kepler]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Marius1614&quot;&gt;[[Simon Marius|Marius, S.]]; (1614) ''[[Mundus Iovialis]] anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici'' [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/marius.html], where he [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html attributes the suggestion] to [[Johannes Kepler]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEDS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/xtra/Bios/marius.html |title=Simon Marius (January 20, 1573 – December 26, 1624) |accessdate=9 August 2007 |publisher=[[University of Arizona]] |work=Students for the Exploration and Development of Space |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713221843/http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/xtra/Bios/marius.html |archivedate=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names fell out of favor for a considerable time and were not revived in general use until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;marazzini&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marazzini |first1=Claudio |title=I nomi dei satelliti di Giove: da Galileo a Simon Marius |trans-title=The names of Jupiter's satellites: from Galileo to Simon Marius |language=Italian |journal=Lettere Italiane |date=2005 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=391–407 |jstor=26267017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the earlier [[astronomy|astronomical]] literature, Europa is simply referred to by its [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] designation as ''{{Nowrap|Jupiter II}}'' (a system also introduced by Galileo) or as the &quot;second satellite of Jupiter&quot;. In 1892, the discovery of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]], whose orbit lay closer to Jupiter than those of the Galilean moons, pushed Europa to the third position. The [[Voyager probes|''Voyager'' probes]] discovered three more [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|inner satellites]] in 1979, so Europa is now counted as Jupiter's sixth satellite, though it is still referred to as {{Nowrap|Jupiter II}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;marazzini&quot;/&gt;
The adjectival form has stabilized as ''Europan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg 2005&quot;&gt;Greenberg (2005) ''Europa: the ocean moon''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US National Research Council (2000) ''A Science Strategy for the Exploration of Europa''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orbit and rotation ==
[[File:Galilean moon Laplace resonance animation 2.gif|thumb|right|Animation of the [[Laplace resonance]] of Io, Europa and Ganymede (conjunctions are highlighted by color changes)]]

Europa orbits Jupiter in just over three and a half days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900&amp;nbsp;km. With an [[orbital eccentricity]] of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the [[orbital inclination]] relative to Jupiter's [[equatorial plane]] is small, at 0.470°.&lt;ref name=&quot;datasheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/#overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970105180851/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 1997|title=Europa, a Continuing Story of Discovery|accessdate=9 August 2007|work=Project Galileo|publisher=NASA, [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its fellow [[Galilean satellites]], Europa is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a [[Poles of astronomical bodies|sub-Jovian point]] on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's [[prime meridian]] is a line passing through this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planetographic Coordinates|publisher=Wolfram Research|url=http://documents.wolfram.com/applications/astronomer/AdditionalInformation/PlanetographicCoordinates.html|date=2010|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301191456/http://documents.wolfram.com/applications/astronomer/AdditionalInformation/PlanetographicCoordinates.html|archivedate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a [[non-synchronous rotation]] has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.&lt;ref name=Geissler&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geissler|first1=P.

The slight eccentricity of Europa's orbit, maintained by the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate towards and away from it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its [[orbital resonance|mean-motion resonance]] with Io.&lt;ref name=&quot;Showman1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Showman |first1=Adam P. |last2=Malhotra |first2=Renu |s2cid=55790129 |title=Tidal Evolution into the Laplace Resonance and the Resurfacing of Ganymede |journal=Icarus |date=May 1997 |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=93–111 |doi=10.1006/icar.1996.5669 |bibcode=1997Icar..127...93S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[tidal flexing]] kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Showman1997&quot; /&gt; The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Showman1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=W.

Analysis of the unique cracks lining Europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Jia-Rui C.

Europa is slightly smaller than the [[Moon]]. At just over {{Convert|3100|km|mi}} in [[diameter]], it is the [[List of moons by diameter|sixth-largest moon]] and [[List of Solar System objects by size|fifteenth-largest object]] in the [[Solar System]]. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masses&quot;&gt;Mass of Europa: 48{{e|21}} kg.

===Internal structure===

It is estimated that Europa has an outer layer of [[water]] around {{Convert|100|km|mi|-0|abbr=on}} thick; a part frozen as its crust, and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice. Recent [[magnetic field|magnetic-field]] data from the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] orbiter showed that Europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with Jupiter's, which suggests the presence of a subsurface conductive layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Europa Clipper Mission Concept |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |date=20 May 2014 |last1=Phillips |first1=Cynthia B. |last2=Pappalardo |first2=Robert T. |volume=95 |issue=20 |pages=165–167 |doi=10.1002/2014EO200002 |bibcode = 2014EOSTr..95..165P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer is likely to be a salty liquid-water ocean.

Europa's most striking surface features are a series of dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe, called ''{{lang|la|[[linea]]e}}'' ({{lang-en|lines}}). Close examination shows that the edges of Europa's crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other. The larger bands are more than {{Convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across, often with dark, diffuse outer edges, regular striations, and a central band of lighter material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geissler1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geissler |first1=P.E. |last2=Greenberg |first2=R. |last3=Hoppa |first3=G. |last4=McEwen |first4=A. |last5=Tufts |first5=R. |last6=Phillips |first6=C. |last7=Clark |first7=B. |last8=Ockert-Bell |first8=M. |last9=Helfenstein |first9=P. |last10=Burns |first10=J. |last11=Veverka |first11=J. |last12=Sullivan |first12=R. |last13=Greeley |first13=R. |last14=Pappalardo |first14=R.T. |last15=Head |first15=J.W. |last16=Belton |first16=M.J.S. |last17=Denk |first17=T. |s2cid=15375333 |title=Evolution of Lineaments on Europa: Clues from Galileo Multispectral Imaging Observations |journal=Icarus |date=September 1998 |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=107–126 |doi=10.1006/icar.1998.5980 |bibcode=1998Icar..135..107G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most likely hypothesis is that the lineae on Europa were produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as the Europan crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figueredo2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Figueredo |first1=Patricio H. |last2=Greeley |first2=Ronald |title=Resurfacing history of Europa from pole-to-pole geological mapping |journal=Icarus |date=February 2004 |volume=167 |issue=2 |pages=287–312 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.09.016 |bibcode=2004Icar..167..287F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect would have been similar to that seen in Earth's [[oceanic ridge]]s. These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal flexing exerted by Jupiter. Because Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, and therefore always maintains approximately the same orientation towards Jupiter, the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa's fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa's surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on Europa's outer ice crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurford2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hurford |first1=T.A. |last2=Sarid |first2=A.R. |last3=Greenberg |first3=R. |title=Cycloidal cracks on Europa: Improved modeling and non-synchronous rotation implications |journal=Icarus |date=January 2007 |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=218–233 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.026 |bibcode=2007Icar..186..218H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons of ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''Galileo'' spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage.

Other features present on Europa are circular and elliptical ''lenticulae'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;freckles&quot;). Many are domes, some are pits and some are smooth, dark spots. Others have a jumbled or rough texture. The dome tops look like pieces of the older plains around them, suggesting that the domes formed when the plains were pushed up from below.&lt;ref name=&quot;diapir&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sotin |first1=Christophe |last2=Head |first2=James W. |last3=Tobie |first3=Gabriel |title=Europa: Tidal heating of upwelling thermal plumes and the origin of lenticulae and chaos melting |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=April 2002 |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=74-1–74-4 |doi=10.1029/2001GL013844 |bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.1233S |url=http://planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/2685.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis states that these lenticulae were formed by [[diapir]]s of warm ice rising up through the colder ice of the outer crust, much like [[magma chamber]]s in Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;diapir&quot; /&gt; The smooth, dark spots could be formed by [[meltwater]] released when the warm ice breaks through the surface. The rough, jumbled lenticulae (called regions of &quot;chaos&quot;; for example, [[Conamara Chaos]]) would then be formed from many small fragments of crust, embedded in hummocky, dark material, appearing like [[iceberg]]s in a frozen sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Jason C. |title=Hydrothermal plume dynamics on Europa: Implications for chaos formation |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2004 |volume=109 |issue=E3 |pages=E03008 |doi=10.1029/2003JE002073 |bibcode=2004JGRE..109.3008G |hdl=1912/3570 |hdl-access=free }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos and that the claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images.

=== Subsurface ocean ===
[[Image:EuropaInterior1.jpg|thumb|Two possible models of Europa]]

Scientists' consensus is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath Europa's surface, and that heat from tidal flexing allows the [[subsurface ocean]] to remain liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greenberg&quot; /&gt; Europa's surface temperature averages about {{Convert|110|K|C F|-1|lk=on}} at the equator and only {{Convert|50|K|C F|-1|}} at the poles, keeping Europa's icy crust as hard as granite.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclo&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of the Solar System |author1=McFadden, Lucy-Ann |author2=Weissman, Paul |author3=Johnson, Torrence |publisher=Elsevier |date=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofso0000unse_m0r6/page/432 432] |isbn=978-0-12-226805-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofso0000unse_m0r6/page/432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating (a consequence of Europa's slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other Galilean moons).

The largest impact structures are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat, fresh ice; based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by Europan tides, it is estimated that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately 10–30&amp;nbsp;km (6–19&amp;nbsp;mi) thick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Improved detection of tides at Europa with radiometric and optical tracking during flybys |journal=Planetary and Space Science |date=July 2015 |last1=Park |first1=Ryan S. |last2=Bills |first2=Bruce |last3=Buffington |first3=Brent B. |volume=112 |pages=10–14 |doi=10.1016/j.pss.2015.04.005 |bibcode = 2015P&amp;SS..112...10P }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a ductile &quot;warm ice&quot; layer, which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be about {{Convert|100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zaina |last=Adamu |title=Water near surface of a Jupiter moon only temporary |date=1 October 2012 |url=http://lightyears.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/01/a-moon-of-jupiter-may-have-water-temporarily/?hpt=us_bn4 |work=CNN News |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a volume of Europa's oceans of 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, between two or three times the volume of Earth's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=All the Water on Europa|date=24 May 2012|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Williams, Matt|url=http://www.universetoday.com/15201/jupiters-moon-europa/|title=Jupiter's Moon Europa|work=Universe Today|date=15 September 2015|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin-ice model suggests that Europa's ice shell may be only a few kilometers thick. However, most planetary scientists conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of Europa's crust that behave elastically when affected by Jupiter's tides. One example is flexure analysis, in which Europa's crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load. Models such as this suggest the outer elastic portion of the ice crust could be as thin as {{Convert|200|m|ft}}. If the ice shell of Europa is really only a few kilometers thick, this &quot;thin ice&quot; model would mean that regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface could occur through open ridges, causing the formation of areas of chaotic terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The great thickness debate: Ice shell thickness models for Europa and comparisons with estimates based on flexure at ridges |author=Billings, Sandra E. |author2=Kattenhorn, Simon A. |journal=Icarus |volume=177 |issue=2 | pages=397–412 |date=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.013 |bibcode=2005Icar..177..397B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Galileo'' orbiter found that Europa has a weak [[magnetic moment]], which is induced by the varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]]) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=C |title=Subsurface Oceans on Europa and Callisto: Constraints from Galileo Magnetometer Observations |journal=Icarus |date=October 2000 |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=329–347 |doi=10.1006/icar.2000.6456 |bibcode=2000Icar..147..329Z |citeseerx=10.1.1.366.7700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior.

The presence of [[sodium chloride]] in the internal ocean has been suggested by a 450&amp;nbsp;nm absorption feature, characteristic of irradiated NaCl crystals, that has been spotted in [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] observations of the chaos regions, presumed to be areas of recent subsurface upwelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trumbo2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trumbo |first1=Samantha K. |last2=Brown |first2=Michael E. |last3=Hand |first3=Kevin P. |title=Sodium chloride on the surface of Europa |journal=Science Advances |date=12 June 2019 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=eaaw7123 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aaw7123 |pmid=31206026 |pmc=6561749 |bibcode=2019SciA....5.7123T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sources of heat====

[[Tidal heating]] occurs through the tidal '''friction''' and tidal '''flexing''' processes caused by [[tidal acceleration]]: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the [[Planetary core|core]] of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa FAQ 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa/faq.cfm |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Europa |work=NASA |date=2012 |accessdate=18 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428110229/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa/faq.cfm |archive-date=28 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tidal friction=====
Ocean tides are converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called [[Rossby wave]]s that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree&lt;!-- and assuming a linear dependency --&gt;, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3{{E|18}} J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger than that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zyga2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientist Explains Why Jupiter's Moon Europa Could Have Energetic Liquid Oceans |url=http://www.physorg.com/news148278114.html |first=Lisa |last=Zyga |publisher=PhysOrg.com |date=12 December 2008|accessdate=28 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tyler |first=Robert H. |title=Strong ocean tidal flow and heating on moons of the outer planets |journal=Nature |date=11 December 2008|volume=456 | pages=770–772 |doi=10.1038/nature07571 |pmid=19079055 |issue=7223 |bibcode =2008Natur.456..770T |s2cid=205215528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zyga2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler2008&quot;/&gt;

=====Tidal flexing=====
Tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and ice shell, which becomes a source of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa/energy.cfm |title=Europa: Energy |work=NASA |date=2012 |accessdate=18 April 2016 |quote=Tidal flexing of the ice shell could create slightly warmer pockets of ice that rise slowly upward to the surface, carrying material from the ocean below. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428191605/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa/energy.cfm |archive-date=28 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the amount of tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tyler |first=Robert |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081212092056.htm |title=Jupiter's Moon Europa Does The Wave To Generate Heat |work=University of Washington |publisher=Science Daily |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa FAQ 2012&quot;/&gt;

=====Radioactive decay=====
In addition to tidal heating, the interior of Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material ([[radiogenic heating]]) within the rocky mantle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa FAQ 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barr |first1=Amy C. |last2=Showman |first2=Adam P. |chapter=Heat transfer in Europa's icy shell |pages=405–430 |bibcode=2009euro.book..405B |citeseerx=10.1.1.499.6279 |editor-last=Pappalardo |editor-first=Robert T. |editor2-last=McKinnon |editor2-first=William B. |editor3-last=Khurana |editor3-first=Krishan |title=Europa |publisher=University of Arizona Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hydrothermal systems on Europa |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=9 March 2005 |last1=Lowell |first1=Robert P. |last2=DuBosse |first2=Myesha |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=L05202 |doi=10.1029/2005GL022375 |bibcode = 2005GeoRL..32.5202L }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus implying that tidal heating has a leading role in Europa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=Javier |title=The heat flow of Europa |journal=Icarus |date=October 2005 |volume=177 |issue=2 |pages=438–446 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.021 |bibcode=2005Icar..177..438R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

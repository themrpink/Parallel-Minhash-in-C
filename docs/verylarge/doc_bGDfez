[[File:20130810 dublin214.JPG|thumb|[[Leinster House]] in [[Dublin]] retains columns under a [[pediment]] for aesthetic reasons.]] 
[[Image:Stonehenge Inside Facing NE April 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Stonehenge]], an example of [[Neolithic architecture]] post and lintel construction.]]

In [[architecture]], '''post and lintel''' (also called '''prop and lintel''' or a '''trabeated system''')  is a building system where strong horizontal elements are held up by strong vertical elements with large spaces between them. This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed.  The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including [[lintel]], header, [[architrave]] or [[Beam (structure)|beam]], and the supporting vertical elements may be called [[column]]s, [[wikt:pillar|pillars]], or [[wikt:post|posts]].  The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], to help spread the load, is common to many traditions. 

The trabeated system is a fundamental principle of [[Neolithic architecture]], [[Indian architecture|ancient Indian architecture]], [[ancient Greek architecture]] and [[ancient Egyptian architecture]]. Other trabeated styles are the [[Persian architecture|Persian]], Lycian, [[Japanese architecture|Japanese]], traditional [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]], and [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture|ancient Chinese]] architecture, especially in northern China,&lt;ref&gt;Post and lintel is the main structural system in Northern China, the southern traditional timber buildings which use a column-and-tie structural system. &quot;Structural Mechanism Of Southern Chinese Traditional Timber Frame Buildings&quot; SCIENCE CHINA Technological Sciences.2011, Vol 54(7) http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112427956/structural-mechanism-of-southern-chinese-traditional-timber-frame-buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly all the [[Indian architecture|Indian]] styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by [[Mayan architecture]], and in South America by [[Inca architecture]].  In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timber framing]], also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day.

The biggest disadvantage to a post and lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the small distances required between the posts. [[Ancient Roman architecture]]'s development of the [[arch]] allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post and lintel trabeated system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel [[girder]] beams in the industrial era.  As with the [[Roman temple]] [[portico]] front and its descendants in later [[classical architecture]], trabeated features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice.  The [[classical order]]s of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually had little or no structural role.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lintel beams==
{{Further|Beam (structure)}}
In architecture, a post-and-lintel or trabeated system refers to the use of horizontal beams or [[lintel]]s which are borne up by [[column]]s or posts.  The name is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''trabs'', ''[[Beam (structure)|beam]]''; influenced by ''trabeatus'', clothed in the ''trabea'', a ritual garment.

A noteworthy example of a trabeated system is in [[Volubilis]], from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, where one side of the [[Decumanus Maximus]] is lined with trabeated elements, while the opposite side of the roadway is designed in arched style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India the style was used originally for wooden construction, but later the technique was adopted for stone structures for decorated load-bearing and purely ornamented non-structural purposes.

==Engineering==
Post and lintel construction is one of four ancient structural methods of building, the others being the [[corbel]], [[Arch and Vault|arch-and-vault]], and [[truss]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague De Camp, Ancient Engineers: Technology &amp; Invention from the Earliest Times to the Renaissance (U.S.A.: Barnes and Noble, 1993 edition), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main force vectors acting upon the post and lintel system: weight carrying [[compression (physical)|compression]] at the joint between lintel and post, and [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] induced by deformation of self-weight and the load above between the posts.&lt;!-- {{Clarify|date=March 2008}} Statics / Engineering 101---&gt; The two posts are under compression from the weight of the lintel (or beam) above. The lintel will deform by sagging in the middle because the underside is under tension and the topside is under compression.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Engineering 101 again, rigid members twist and bend... watch any local tree in a breeze --&gt;

==History and recording==
According to Mercury's friend Chris Smith (a keyboard player in [[Smile (band)|Smile]]), Mercury first started developing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in the late 1960s; Mercury used to play parts of songs he was writing at the time on the piano, and one of his pieces, known simply as &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;, contained lyrics that ended up in the completed version produced years later, in 1975, specifically, &quot;Mama&amp;nbsp;... just killed a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Interview | first = Chris | last = Smith | type = documentary | title = Queen: Days of our Lives | work = BBC | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]], who began working with Queen in 1972, related how Mercury once played the opening ballad section on the piano for him in Mercury's flat: &quot;He played the beginning on the piano, then stopped and said, 'And this is where the opera section comes in!' Then we went out to eat dinner.&quot;  Guitarist [[Brian May]] said the band thought that Mercury's blueprint for the song was &quot;intriguing and original, and worthy of work&quot;.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} According to May, much of Queen's material was written in the studio, but this song &quot;was all in Freddie's mind&quot; before they started.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} In an interview during the band's Australian tour early in 1985, Mercury said, &quot;It was basically three songs that I wanted to put out and I just put the three together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |title=Freddie Mercury-Interview in Sydney 1985 (1080p) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RoYpUoRkY |date=6 January 2014 |website=YouTube |access-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302013439/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RoYpUoRkY |archive-date=2 March 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen spent a month rehearsing at [[Ridge Farm Studio]] in [[Surrey]] in mid-1975, and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] recalled that &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was one of the songs the band worked on while they were there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Salter |title=Roger Taylor remembers rehearsing with Queen in 1975 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8344914/Roger-Taylor-remembers-rehearsing-with-Queen-in-1975.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712023743/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8344914/Roger-Taylor-remembers-rehearsing-with-Queen-in-1975.html |archive-date=12 July 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording began on 24 August 1975 at [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield Studio 1]] near [[Monmouth]], [[South Wales]], after a three-week rehearsal at [[Penrhos, Herefordshire|Penrhos Court]], near [[Kington, Herefordshire]]. During the making of the track, four additional studios – Roundhouse, [[Sarm East Studios]], [[Scorpio Sound]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]] – were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Mercury used a [[C. Bechstein]] concert grand piano, which he played in the promotional video and the UK tour. Due to the elaborate nature of the song, it was recorded in various sections.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} The piano was allegedly the same one [[Paul McCartney]] used to record [[the Beatles]]' song &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Horton&quot;/&gt; as well as the same one [[Rick Wakeman]] used on [[David Bowie]]'s 1971 album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pegg |first=Nicholas |title=The Complete David Bowie |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |edition=7th |location=London |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-78565-365-0 |page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|Trident piano|date=June 2020}}

Baker recalled in 1999:

{{quote|&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was totally insane, but we enjoyed every minute of it. It was basically a joke, but a successful joke. [Laughs]. We had to record it in three separate units. We did the whole beginning bit, then the whole middle bit and then the whole end. It was complete madness. The middle part started off being just a couple of seconds, but Freddie kept coming in with more &quot;Galileos&quot; and we kept on adding to the opera section, and it just got bigger and bigger. We never stopped laughing... It started off as a ballad, but the end was heavy.&lt;ref name=&quot;mix1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_roy_thomas_baker/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426041352/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_roy_thomas_baker/|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 April 2005|title=Roy Thomas Baker: TAKING CHANCES AND MAKING HITS |first=Rick|last=Clark|website=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]|date=1 April 1999|accessdate=28 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

May, Mercury, and Taylor reportedly sang their vocal parts continually for 10 to 12 hours a day.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The entire piece took three weeks to record, and in some sections featured 180 separate [[Overdubbing|overdubs]].{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Since the studios of the time only offered 24-track analogue tape, it was necessary for the three to overdub themselves many times and &quot;bounce&quot; these down to successive [[Stem mixing and mastering|sub-mixes]]. In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|spliced]] (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.{{Sfn|Classic Albums | 2006}} A similar story was told in 1977 by Taylor regarding the elaborate overdubs and sub-mixes for &quot;The March of The Black Queen&quot; for the album ''[[Queen II]]''. At that time, the band was using 16-track equipment.&lt;ref name=TDIMGTQ&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Phil |author-link=Phil Chapman |date=July 2019 |title=This Day In Music's Guide To Queen |publisher=This Day In Music Books |isbn=978-1-9995927-8-3 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer Baker recalls that May's solo was done on only one track, rather than recording multiple tracks. May stated that he wanted to compose &quot;a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody&quot;. The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: &quot;the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.&quot;{{Sfn | BBC| 2004b}} According to Baker, &quot;the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with [[mix automation|automation]]... If you really listen to it, the ballad starts off clean, and as the opera section gets louder and louder, the vocals get more and more distorted. You can still hear this on the CD. They are clearly distorted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mix1999&quot;/&gt;

Music scholar Sheila Whiteley suggests that &quot;the title draws strongly on contemporary rock ideology, the [[individualism]] of the ''[[bohemianism|bohemian]]'' artists' world, with ''[[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]]'' affirming the romantic ideals of [[art rock]]&quot;.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} Commenting on bohemianism, Judith Peraino said, &quot;Mercury intended&amp;nbsp;... [this song] to be a 'mock opera', something outside the norm of rock songs, and it does follow a certain operatic logic: choruses of multi-tracked voices alternate with [[aria]]-like solos, the emotions are excessive, the plot confusing.&quot;{{Sfn |Peraino|2005|p=230}}

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; begins with an introduction, then goes into a piano ballad, before a [[guitar solo]] leads to an operatic interlude. A hard rock part follows this and it concludes with a coda. The song is in the keys of [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], [[A major]] and [[F major]], and is predominantly in {{music|time|4|4}} meter.&lt;!--- I'm seeing multiple serious-looking forum posts that the timing contains a brief period of 2/4 and then some 6/8 after this, but nothing I could cite. (The triplet feel during the hard rock section *can* be written as 12/8 but doesn't have to be.)---&gt; This musical format of writing a song as a suite with changes in style, tone and tempo throughout was uncommon in most mainstream [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] music but common in [[progressive rock]]. The genre had reached its artistic and commercial zenith between 1970 and 1975 in the music of British bands such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Gentle Giant]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]] and [[Curved Air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Theo|last=Cateforis |title=The Rock History Reader|year=2012|page=159|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415892131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of progressive rock was characterised by dramatic contrasts, frequent shifts in tempo and in rhythmic character from one section of a composition to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward|last=Macan |title=Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture|url=https://archive.org/details/rockingclassicse0000maca|url-access=registration|year=1997|page=[https://archive.org/details/rockingclassicse0000maca/page/193 193]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195098884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands from the genre had blended rock with [[classical music]], its structural features and compositional practices, as well as using classical music instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=John Covach |editor2=Graeme M.

===Intro (0:00–0:49)===
The song begins with a close five-part harmony [[a cappella]] introduction in B{{Music|flat}} major—as evidenced by the presence of a V–I cadence (F7–B{{Music|flat}}) [[multitrack recording|multi-track recordings]] of Mercury although the video has all four members [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] this part. The lyrics question whether life is &quot;real&quot; or &quot;just fantasy caught in a [[landslide]]&quot; before concluding that there can be &quot;no escape from reality&quot;.

After 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E{{Music|flat}} major and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as &quot;just a poor boy&quot; but declares that he &quot;needs no sympathy&quot; because he is &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; and then &quot;little high, little low&quot; (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words &quot;little high&quot; come from the left speaker and the &quot;little low&quot; comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano [[vamp (music)|vamp]] in B{{Music|flat}}.

===Ballad (0:49–2:37)===
{{Listen
|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody Mama.ogg
|title = &quot;Mama, just killed a man&quot;
|description = This sample features the distinctive piano phrase in B{{Music|flat}} and the first line of the first verse.
}}
The piano begins in B{{Music|flat}} major along with the entrance of [[John Deacon]]'s bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Throughout the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has &quot;just killed a man,&quot; with &quot;a gun against his head&quot; and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This &quot;confessional&quot; section, Whiteley comments, is &quot;affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution&quot;.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his &quot;mama&quot; in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over &quot;mak[ing] you cry&quot; and urging &quot;mama&quot; to &quot;carry on as if nothing really matters&quot;. A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.

Then the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line &quot;sends shivers down my spine&quot;, by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has &quot;got to go&quot; and prepares to &quot;face the truth&quot; admitting &quot;I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.&quot; This is where the guitar solo enters.

===Guitar solo (2:37–3:05)===
Towards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and  composed by Brian May. The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the &quot;Opera&quot; section.

===Opera (3:05–4:07)===
{{Listen
|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg
|title = &quot;Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?&quot;
|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.
}}
A rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury, and himself combined created a wide vocal range: &quot;Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.&quot; The band wanted to create &quot;a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up&quot;.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics &quot;Magnifico&quot; and &quot;Let me go&quot;. Also, on &quot;Let him go&quot;, Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the &quot;choir&quot; have stopped singing.

Lyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to &quot;let [him] go&quot; and &quot;spare him his life from this monstrosity&quot;, while others sending him &quot;thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]&quot;. According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also a figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric &quot;[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!&quot;, on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).

Using the 24-track technology available at the time, the &quot;opera&quot; section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said, &quot;Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.&quot;{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}

=== Hard rock (4:07–4:54)===
The operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified &quot;you&quot;, accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting &quot;can't do this to me, baby&quot;, before the final lines conclude that the singer &quot;just gotta get right outta&quot; an unspecified &quot;here&quot;. Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].

===Outro (4:54–5:55)===
After Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final &quot;nothing really matters&quot; section. A guitar accompanies the chorus &quot;ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.&quot; A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the &quot;[[Deacy Amp]]&quot;. Mercury's line &quot;Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...&quot; appears again, &quot;cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span&quot;.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line &quot;nothing really matters&quot; is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, &quot;Any way the wind blows&quot;, is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.

==Lyrics==
''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that &quot;the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics&quot;. Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls &quot;Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.&quot;{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is &quot;fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle&quot;.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}

When the band released a ''Greatest Hits'' cassette in Iran, a leaflet in [[Farsi language|Persian]] was included with translation and explanations (refers to a book published in Iran called ''The March of the Black Queen'' by Sarah Sefati and Farhad Arkani, which included the whole biography of the band and complete lyrics with Persian translation (2000)). In the explanation, Queen states that &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, &quot;[[Basmala|Bismillah]]&quot; (&quot;In the name of God&quot; in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}

Despite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply &quot;random rhyming nonsense&quot;.{{Sfn|Black|2002}}

Still, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, &quot;living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')&quot;.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as a veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807185012/https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|archive-date=7 August 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]
When the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921172451/http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |archive-date=21 September 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: &quot;we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...&quot;{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked—Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that &quot;it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!&quot;{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David &quot;Diddy&quot; Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show. Hall stated &quot;Monster, Monster! This could be a hit!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lesley-Ann |last=Jones |author-link=Lesley-Ann Jones |title=Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography |publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] |page=151 |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-44473-369-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song became the 1975 [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|UK Christmas number one]], holding the top position for nine weeks.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was the first song ever to get to number one in the UK twice with the same version,{{Sfn|BBC|2005}} and is also the only single to have been Christmas number one twice with the same version. The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with &quot;[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]&quot;) in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.

In the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot; /&gt; In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is &quot;the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America&quot;.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardYE1976&quot; /&gt; With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPMTop100&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with &quot;[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]&quot; in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research. The song re-entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart after 16 years, reaching number two and spending 17 weeks on the chart, with a year-end chart position of 39. After the release of [[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|the Queen biopic named after the song]], it re-entered the charts for a third time at No. 33, marking 26 years since it last charted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Makes Rare Third Visit to Billboard Hot 100 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8484827/queen-bohemian-rhapsody-prince-1999-hot-100 |work=Billboard |date=13 November 2018 |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114044410/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8484827/queen-bohemian-rhapsody-prince-1999-hot-100 |archive-date=14 November 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certified gold by the RIAA a second time on 8 August 2005 for digital download sales over 100,000, and quadruple platinum on 23 April 2014 for combined digital sales and streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot; /&gt; It has sold 4.4 million digital copies in the US {{as of|2017|09|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;sales_us&quot;/&gt;

Though some artists had made [[music video|video clips]] to accompany songs (including Queen themselves; for example, their earlier singles &quot;[[Keep Yourself Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]&quot;, &quot;[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]&quot; and &quot;[[Killer Queen]]&quot; already had &quot;pop promos&quot;, as they were known at the time), it was only after the success of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; that it became a regular practice for [[record industry|record companies]] to produce promotional videos for artists' single releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jari |last=Muikku |title=On the role and tasks of a record producer |journal=Popular Music and Society |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |date=1990 |doi=10.1080/03007769008591381}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos could then be shown on television shows around the world, such as the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', without the need for the artist to appear in person. A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'' since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}

The band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band was rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of £4,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the result, and &quot;was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.&quot;{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}

The video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

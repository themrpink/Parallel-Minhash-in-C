Most of the blame for the defeat probably lies in the events of the battle.&lt;ref name=Lawson217&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; William was the more experienced military leader,&lt;ref name=Lawson219/&gt; and in addition the lack of cavalry on the English side allowed Harold fewer tactical options.&lt;ref name=Huscroft130/&gt; Some writers have criticised Harold for not exploiting the opportunity offered by the rumoured death of William early in the battle.&lt;ref name=Walker180&gt;Walker ''Harold'' pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; The English appear to have erred in not staying strictly on the defensive, for when they pursued the retreating Normans they exposed their flanks to attack. Whether this was due to the inexperience of the English commanders or the indiscipline of the English soldiers is unclear.&lt;ref name=Lawson219&gt;Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Modern [[wargaming]] has demonstrated the correctness of not pursuing the fleeing Normans,&lt;ref name=Marren152/&gt; with the historian [[Christopher Gravett]] stating that if in a wargame he allowed Harold to pursue the Normans, his opponent &quot;promptly, and rightly, punished such rashness with a brisk counter-attack with proved to be the turning point of the battle&amp;nbsp;– just as in 1066&quot;.&lt;ref name=QMarren152&gt;Quoted in Marren ''1066'' p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the end, Harold's death appears to have been decisive, as it signalled the break-up of the English forces in disarray.&lt;ref name=Huscroft130/&gt; The historian [[David Nicolle]] said of the battle that William's army &quot;demonstrated&amp;nbsp;– not without difficulty&amp;nbsp;– the superiority of Norman-French mixed cavalry and infantry tactics over the Germanic-Scandinavian infantry traditions of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;&lt;ref name=Normans20&gt;Nicolle ''Normans'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battleabbey-wyrdlight-0190.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the monks' dormitory at Battle Abbey]]
The day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or by marks on his body.{{efn|A 12th-century tradition stated that Harold's face could not be recognised and [[Edith the Fair]], Harold's [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]], was brought to the battlefield to identify his body from marks that only she knew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gravett80&quot; /&gt;}}  His personal standard was presented to William,&lt;ref name=Rex253&gt;Rex ''Harold II'' p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; and later sent to the papacy.&lt;ref name=Gravett76/&gt; The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield,&lt;ref name=Huscroft131/&gt; although some were removed by relatives later.&lt;ref name=Gravett81&gt;Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, which has not been found.&lt;ref name=Marren146/&gt;{{efn|It is possible the grave site was located where the abbey now stands.&lt;ref name=Marren146/&gt;}} Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and it is probable that the death rate among the common soldiers was higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated,{{efn|He states that there were 15,000 casualties out of 60,000 who fought on William's side at the battle.&lt;ref name=Marren147/&gt;}} his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings.&lt;ref name=Marren147&gt;Marren ''1066'' pp. 147–149&lt;/ref&gt; Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. Although scholars thought for a long time that remains would not be recoverable, due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view.&lt;ref name=past6&gt;Livesay &quot;Skeleton 180 Shock Dating Result&quot; ''Sussex Past and Present'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought to be associated with the 13th century [[Battle of Lewes]], now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.&lt;ref name=sac148&gt;Barber &quot;Medieval Hospital of St Nicholas&quot; ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'' pp. 79–109&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This skeleton, numbered 180, sustained six fatal sword cuts to the back of the skull and was one of five skeletons that had suffered violent trauma. Analysis continues on the other remains to try to build up a more accurate picture of who the individuals are.&lt;ref name=&quot;past6&quot;/&gt;}}

One story relates that [[Gytha Thorkelsdóttir|Gytha]], Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear.&lt;ref name=Huscroft131/&gt; Another story relates that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff.&lt;ref name=Marren146&gt;Marren ''1066'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.&lt;ref name=Huscroft131&gt;Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.&lt;ref name=Gravett81/&gt;

[[File:BattleNormannen.JPG|thumb|right|[[Battle of Hastings reenactment|Reenactment]] in front of [[Battle Abbey]]]]

William expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders after his victory, but instead [[Edgar the Ætheling]]{{efn|Ætheling is the Anglo-Saxon term for a royal prince with some claim to the throne.&lt;ref name=Bennett91&gt;Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;}} was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], the Archbishop of York.&lt;ref name=Douglas204&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; William therefore advanced on London, marching around the coast of [[Kent]]. He defeated an English force that attacked him at [[Southwark]] but was unable to storm [[London Bridge]], forcing him to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.&lt;ref name=Douglas205&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt;

William moved up the [[Thames]] valley to cross the river at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], where he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the [[Chilterns]], before advancing towards London from the north-west,{{efn|William appears to have taken this route to meet up with reinforcements that had landed by Portsmouth and met him between London and Winchester. By swinging around to the north, William cut off London from reinforcements.&lt;ref name=Bennett45&gt;Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}} fighting further engagements against forces from the city. The English leaders surrendered to William at [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name=Douglas205/&gt;

Despite the submission of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years.&lt;ref name=Douglas212&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; There were rebellions in Exeter in late 1067, an invasion by Harold's sons in mid-1068, and an uprising in Northumbria in 1068.&lt;ref name=Bennett49&gt;Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1069 William faced more troubles from Northumbrian rebels, an invading Danish fleet, and rebellions in the south and west of England. He ruthlessly put down the various risings, culminating in the [[Harrying of the North]] in late 1069 and early 1070 that devastated parts of northern England.&lt;ref name=Bennett51&gt;Bennett, ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'', pp. 51–53&lt;/ref&gt; A further rebellion in 1070 by [[Hereward the Wake]] was also defeated by the king, at Ely.&lt;ref name=Bennett57&gt;Bennett ''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'' pp. 57–60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Battle Abbey]] was founded by William at the site of the battle. According to 12th-century sources, William made a vow to found the abbey, and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died.&lt;ref name=Bennett43/&gt; More likely, the foundation was imposed on William by [[papal legate]]s in 1070.&lt;ref name=Coad32&gt;Coad ''Battle Abbey and Battlefield'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey, and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled.&lt;ref name=Gravett91/&gt; After the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the abbey's lands passed to secular landowners, who used it as a residence or country house.&lt;ref name=Coad42&gt;Coad ''Battle Abbey and Battlefield'' pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence.&lt;ref name=Coad48&gt;Coad ''Battle Abbey and Battlefield'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by [[English Heritage]] and are open to the public.&lt;ref name=Marren165&gt;Marren ''1066'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle, perhaps to hang at the bishop's palace at Bayeux.&lt;ref name=Coad31&gt;Coad ''Battle Abbey and Battlefield'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The first recorded mention of the tapestry is from 1476, but it is similar in style to late Anglo-Saxon manuscript illustrations and may have been composed and executed in England.&lt;ref name=Coad31/&gt; The Tapestry now is displayed at the former Bishop's Palace at [[Bayeux]] in France.&lt;ref name=Gravett99&gt;Gravett ''Hastings'' p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;}} In modern times annual [[Battle of Hastings reenactment|reenactments]] of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Normans fight Saxons... and the rain|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/970522.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=King Harold and William square up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/6050986.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Porcupines''' are large [[rodent]]s with coats of sharp and pointy [[Spine (zoology)|spines]], or quills, that protect them against predators. The term covers two [[Family (biology)|families]] of animals: the [[Old World porcupine]]s of family '''Hystricidae''', and the [[New World porcupine]]s of family '''Erethizontidae'''. Both families belong to the infraorder [[Hystricognathi]] within the profoundly diverse [[order (biology)|order]] Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.  It is the third largest living [[rodent]] in the world after the [[capybara]] and [[beaver]].

The Old World porcupines live in southern [[Europe]], [[Asia]] (western&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/topical/p/porcupine.htm Porcupine]. biblehub.com&lt;/ref&gt; and southern), and most of [[Africa]]. They are large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal. In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terms, they form the family Hystricidae.

The New World porcupines are indigenous to [[North America]] and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives, and generally smaller. In taxonomic terms, they form the family Erethizontidae.

Most porcupines are about {{convert|25|-|36|in|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a {{convert|8|-|10|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} long tail. Weighing {{convert|12|-|35|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, they are rounded, large, and slow, and use [[aposematic]] strategy of defence. Porcupines occur in various shades of brown, grey and white. Porcupines' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated [[Erinaceomorpha|erinaceomorph]] [[hedgehog]]s and Australian [[monotreme]] [[echidna]]s as well as [[Tenrecidae|tenrecid]] [[tenrec]]s.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;porcupine&quot; comes from [[Latin]] ''porcus'' pig + ''spina'' spine, quill, via Old Italian (Italian &quot;porcospino&quot;, thorn-pig)—[[Middle French]]—[[Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'', s.v. &quot;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/porcupine porcupine]&quot; .

Retrieved July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Fossils belonging to the genus ''Hystrix'' date back to the late [[Miocene]] of the continent of Africa.&lt;ref name=Barthelmess2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barthelmess, E.L. | year = 2006 | title = ''Hystix africaeaustralis'' | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 788 | issue = 788 |pages = 1–7 | doi = 10.1644/788.1| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
[[File:Ялтинский зоопарк 079.jpg|left|thumb|[[Old World porcupine]]]]

===Taxonomy===
A porcupine is any of 58 species of [[rodent]]s belonging to the families [[Erethizontidae]] (genera: ''[[Coendou]]'', ''[[Erethizon]]'', and ''[[Chaetomys]]'') or [[Hystricidae]] (genera: ''[[Atherurus]]'', ''[[Hystrix (porcupine)|Hystrix]]'', and ''[[Trichys]]''). Porcupines vary in size considerably: [[Rothschild's porcupine]] of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb); the [[crested porcupine]] found in [[Italy]], [[North Africa]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] can grow to well over {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the [[Hystricognathi]] branch of the vast order [[Rodent]]ia, they are not closely related.

===Old World compared with New World species===
The 11 [[Old World porcupine]]s tend to be fairly large, and have spikes grouped in clusters.

The two subfamilies of [[New World porcupine]]s are mostly smaller (although the [[North American porcupine]] reaches about {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} in length and {{convert|18|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through [[convergent evolution]]) and are more closely related to several other families of rodents than they are to the Old World porcupines. {{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Longevity===
Porcupines have a relatively high [[longevity]] and have held the record for being the longest-living rodent, with one individual living to 27 years,&lt;ref&gt;Parker, SB (1990) Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals, vol. 4, McGraw-Hill, New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the record was broken in 2002 by a [[naked mole-rat]] living to 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sageke.2002.21.pe7 |pmid=14602989 |date=May 2002 |last1=Buffenstein |first1=Rochelle |last2=Jarvis |first2=Jennifer U. M. |title=The naked mole rat—a new record for the oldest living rodent |volume=2002 |issue=21 |pages=7pe–7|journal= Science of Aging Knowledge Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
The North American porcupine is an herbivore; it eats leaves, herbs, twigs, and green plants such as [[clover]]. In the winter, it may eat bark. It often climbs trees to find food.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/porcupine/ |title=Porcupines, Porcupine Pictures, Porcupine Facts |work=National Geographic |accessdate=2012-02-20|date=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African porcupine is not a climber and forages on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;/&gt; It is mostly [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pornoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhm.org/site/explore-exhibits/permanent-exhibits/north-american-mammals/porcupine |title=North American porcupine – Erethizon dorsatum (Linnaeus, 1758) |publisher=Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607082910/http://www.nhm.org/site/explore-exhibits/permanent-exhibits/north-american-mammals/porcupine |archive-date=June 7, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but will sometimes forage for food in the day, eating bark, roots, fruits and berries, as well as farm crops. Porcupines have become a pest in [[Kenya]] and are eaten as a delicacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4157330.stm|title=Porcupines raise thorny questions in Kenya|date=August 19, 2005|work=BBC News |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense===
Defensive behaviour displays in a porcupine depend on sight, scent and sound. Often, these displays are shown when a porcupine becomes agitated or annoyed. There are four main displays seen in a porcupine which are quill erection, teeth clattering, emitting of odour, and attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAP&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roze|first1=Uldis|title=The North American Porcupine Second Edition|date=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Cornell University, United States of America|isbn=978-0-8014-4646-7|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; These displays are ranked from least aggressive to most aggressive respectively. A porcupine's colouring aids in part of its defence as most of the predators are [[nocturnal]] and colour blind. A porcupine's markings are black and white. The dark body and coarse hair of the porcupine are a dark brown/black and when quills are raised, present a white strip down its back mimicking the look of a skunk. This, along with the raising of the sharp quills, deters predators. Along with the raising of the quills, porcupines clatter their teeth causing warning noise to let predators know not to come closer. The incisors vibrate against each other, the strike zone shifts back and the cheek teeth clatter. This behaviour is often paired with body shivering which is used to further display the dangerous quills.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAP&quot; /&gt; The rattling of quills is aided by the hollow quills at the back end of the porcupine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotic&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roze, Locke|first1=Uldis, David|title=Antibiotic Properties of Porcupine Quills|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=March 1990|volume=16|issue=3|pages=725–734|doi=10.1007/bf01016483|pmid=24263588}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of odor is when the sight and sound have failed. An invasive scent is produced from the skin above the tail in times of stress, and is often seen with quill erection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warning Odor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guang|first1=Li|title=Waring Odor of the North American Porcupine|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=1997|volume=23|issue=12|pages=2737–2754|doi=10.1023/a:1022511026529|bibcode=1997JSP....23.2737L}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the above processes fail, the porcupine will attack by running sideways or backwards into predators. A porcupine's tail is also able to swing in the direction of the predator. If contact is made, the quills could be impaled into the predator causing injury or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quills Kill&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mori|first1=Emiliano|title=The defense strategy of the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata|journal=ResearchGate|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quills====
[[File:Stekelvarken Aiguilles Porc-épic.jpg|left|thumb|Quills grow in varying lengths and colours, depending on the animal's age and species.]]
Porcupines' quills, or [[spine (zoology)|spines]], take on various forms, depending on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of [[keratin]],&lt;ref name=Attenborough&gt;{{cite AV media | author=David Attenborough | title=Attenborough's Natural Curiosities 2 | volume=Armoured Animals | year=2014 | publisher=UKTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embedded in the [[skin]] musculature. Old World porcupines  have quills embedded in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines, single quills are interspersed with bristles, underfur, and hair.

Quills are released by contact or may drop out when the porcupine shakes its body. New quills grow to replace lost ones.&lt;ref name=Attenborough/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/porcupines/|title=Porcupines {{!}} National Geographic|date=2010-09-10|website=Animals|access-date=2019-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porcupines were long believed to have the ability to project their quills to a considerable distance at an enemy, but this has since been proven to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Or, A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Enlarged and Improved|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr33unkngoog|year=1823|publisher=Archibald Constable|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr33unkngoog/page/n517 501]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shepard, Thomas Goodwin|title=The natural history of secession|url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistorys01goodgoog|year=1865|publisher=Derby &amp; Miller|pages=[https://archive.org/details/naturalhistorys01goodgoog/page/n95 78]–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some possible [[antibiotics|antibiotic]] properties within the quills, specifically associated with the free fatty acids coating the quills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotic&quot; /&gt; The antibiotic properties are believed to aid a porcupine that has suffered from self-injury.

==Uses by humans==
[[File:MAPElNorte041.JPG|thumbnail|Porcupine guardhair headdress made by native peoples from [[Sonora]] displayed at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Porcupines are seldom eaten in [[Western culture]], but are very popular in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly [[Vietnam]], where the prominent use of them as a food source has contributed to significant declines in their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100825103830.htm |title=Wild Southeast Asian porcupines under threat due to illegal hunting, researchers find |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.07.030|title=The conservation impact of commercial wildlife farming of porcupines in Vietnam|year=2010|last1=Brooks|first1=Emma G.E.|last2=Roberton|first2=Scott I.|last3=Bell|first3=Diana J.|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=143|issue=11|pages=2808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ettinger, Powell |url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/porcupine-vietnam.html#cr |title=Wildlife Extra News – Illegal hunting threatens Vietnam's wild porcupines |publisher=Wildlifeextra.com |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As mentioned, in Kenya porcupines  are eaten as a delicacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; --&gt;

More commonly, their quills and guardhairs are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Roach (headdress)|&quot;porky roach&quot;]] headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. [[Lakota people|Lakota]] women would harvest the quills for [[quillwork]] by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=8681 |accessdate= 29 June 2013 |title= Lakota Quillwork Art and Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of barbs, acting like anchors, makes it more painful to remove a quill that has pierced the skin.&lt;ref name=Attenborough/&gt; The shape of the barbs makes the quills more effective, both for penetrating the skin and remaining in place.&lt;ref name=Cho2012&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216441109|title=Microstructured barbs on the North American porcupine quill enable easy tissue penetration and difficult removal|year=2012|last1=Cho|first1=W.

M.|pmid=23236138|pmc=3535670|bibcode=2012PNAS..10921289C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quills have inspired research for such applications as the design of hypodermic needles and surgical staples.&lt;ref name=Cho2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Porcupines Give You 30,000 Reasons to Back Off {{!}} Deep Look|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZphlCdI2yqA|language=en|access-date=2020-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the current design for surgical staples, the porcupine quill and barb design would allow for easy and painless insertion as the staple would stay in the skin using the anchored barb design rather than being bent under the skin like traditional staples.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Tree Climbing Porcupines.jpg|thumb|A pair of North American porcupines in their habitat in [[Quebec]]]]
Porcupines occupy a small range of habitats in tropical and temperate parts of Asia, Southern Europe, Africa, and North and South America. They live in forests and deserts, rocky outcrops, and hillsides. Some New World porcupines live in trees, but Old World porcupines stay on the rocks. Porcupines can be found on rocky areas up to {{convert|3700|m|abbr=on}} high. They are generally nocturnal, but are occasionally active during daylight.

''' Dominique François Jean Arago''' ({{lang-ca|Domènec Francesc Joan Aragó}}), known simply as '''François Arago''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa aʁaɡo|lang}}; Catalan: ''Francesc Aragó'', {{IPA-ca|fɾənˈsɛsk əɾəˈɣo|IPA}}; 26 February 1786{{snd}}2 October 1853), was a French [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[astronomer]], [[freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;''Victor SCHOELCHER Républicain et franc-maçon'', Anne GIROLLET, ed. Maçonnique Française, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; supporter of the [[carbonari]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire universel de la Franc-Maçonnerie By Monique Cara, Jean-Marc Cara, Marc Jode&lt;/ref&gt; and politician.

==Early life and work==
Arago was born at [[Estagel]], a small village of 3,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Francois Arago|journal=The Canadian Journal|year=1854|volume=2|page=159|url=https://archive.org/stream/canadianjournal14goog#page/n171/mode/1up|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Perpignan]], in the ''{{lang|fr|département}}'' of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], France, where his father held the position of Treasurer of the Mint.
His parents were François Bonaventure Arago (1754–1814) and [[Marie Arago]] (1755–1845).

Arago was the eldest of four brothers. Jean (1788–1836) emigrated to North America and became a general in the Mexican army. [[Jacques Arago|Jacques Étienne Victor]] (1799–1855) took part in [[Louis de Freycinet]]'s exploring voyage in the ''Uranie'' from 1817 to 1821, and on his return to France devoted himself to his journalism and the drama. The fourth brother, [[Étienne Arago|Étienne Vincent]] (1802–1892), is said to have collaborated with [[Honoré de Balzac]] in ''The Heiress of Birague'', and from 1822 to 1847 wrote a great number of light dramatic pieces, mostly in collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Arago, Dominique François Jean|volume=2|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing decided military tastes, François Arago was sent to the municipal college of [[Perpignan]], where he began to study [[mathematics]] in preparation for the entrance examination of the [[École Polytechnique]]. Within two years and a half he had mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a great deal more, and, on going up for examination at [[Toulouse]], he astounded his examiner by his knowledge of [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|J. L. Lagrange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

Towards the close of 1803, Arago entered the [[École Polytechnique]], Paris, but apparently found the professors there incapable of imparting knowledge or maintaining discipline. The [[artillery]] service was his ambition, and in 1804, through the advice and recommendation of [[Siméon Poisson]], he received the appointment of secretary to the [[Paris Observatory]]. 
He now became acquainted with [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], and through his influence was commissioned, with [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], to complete the [[meridian arc]] measurements which had been begun by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|J. B. J. Delambre]], and interrupted since the death of [[P. F. A. Méchain]] in 1804 (the [[meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain]]). 
Arago and Biot left Paris in 1806 and began operations along the mountains of Spain.
Biot returned to Paris after they had determined the latitude of [[Formentera]], the southernmost point to which they were to carry the survey.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt; 
Arago continued the work until 1809, his purpose being to measure a meridian [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] in order to determine the exact length of a metre.

After Biot's departure, the political ferment caused by the entrance of the French into Spain extended to the [[Balearic Islands]], and the population suspected Arago's movements and his lighting of fires on the top of Mount Galatzó ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: Mola de l'Esclop) as the activities of a spy for the invading army. Their reaction was such that he was obliged to give himself up for imprisonment in the fortress of [[Bellver]] in June 1808. On 28 July he escaped from the island in a fishing-boat, and after an adventurous voyage he reached [[Algiers]] on 3 August. From there he obtained a passage in a vessel bound for [[Marseille]], but on 16 August, just as the vessel was nearing Marseille, it fell into the hands of a Spanish [[Privateer|corsair]]. With the rest the crew, Arago was taken to [[Roses, Girona|Roses]], and imprisoned first in a windmill, and afterwards in a fortress, until the town fell into the hands of the French, when the prisoners were transferred to [[Palamos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

After three months' imprisonment, Arago and the others were released on the demand of the [[dey]] of Algiers, and again set sail for Marseille on 28 November, but then within sight of their port they were driven back by a northerly wind to [[Béjaïa|Bougie]] on the coast of Africa. Transport to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary delay of three months; Arago, therefore, set out over land, guided by a Muslim priest, and reached it on Christmas Day. After six months in Algiers he once again, on 21 June 1809, set sail for Marseille, where he had to undergo a monotonous and inhospitable quarantine in the [[lazaretto]], before his difficulties were over. The first letter he received, while in the lazaretto, was from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]; and this was the origin of a connection which, in Arago's words, &quot;lasted over forty years without a single cloud ever having troubled it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

==Scientific studies==
Arago had succeeded in preserving the records of his survey; and his first act on his return home was to deposit them in the [[Bureau des Longitudes]] at Paris. As a reward for his adventurous conduct in the cause of science, he was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], at the remarkably early age of twenty-three, and before the close of 1809 he was chosen by the council of the [[École Polytechnique]] to succeed [[Gaspard Monge]] in the chair of [[analytical geometry]]. At the same time he was named by the emperor one of the astronomers of the Paris Observatory, which was accordingly his residence till his death. It was in this capacity that he delivered his remarkably successful series of popular lectures in astronomy, which were continued from 1812 to 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

In 1818 or 1819 he proceeded along with Biot to execute [[Geodesy|geodetic]] operations on the coasts of France, England and Scotland. They measured the length of the seconds-pendulum at [[Leith]], Scotland, and in the [[Shetland Islands]], the results of the observations being published in 1821, along with those made in Spain. Arago was elected a member of the Bureau des Longitudes immediately afterwards, and contributed to each of its Annuals, for about twenty-two years, important scientific notices on astronomy and [[meteorology]] and occasionally on [[civil engineering]], as well as interesting memoirs of members of the Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

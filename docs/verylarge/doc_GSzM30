# Stretches of dry or marshy coastland with coral reefs on the [[Red Sea]] side ([[Tihamah]])
# Oases and marshy coast-land in [[Eastern Arabia]] on the [[Persian Gulf]] side, the most important of which are those of [[Al Ain]] (in the UAE, on the border with Oman) and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] (in Saudi Arabia), according to one author&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavendish2007&quot;/&gt;

Arabia has few lakes or permanent rivers. Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.

According to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003–2013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA_GRACE&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |access-date=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers &quot;have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted&quot; and thirteen of them are &quot;considered significantly distressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA_GRACE&quot; /&gt;

A plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula. The plateau slopes eastwards from the massive, rifted escarpment along the coast of the Red Sea, to the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior is characterised by ''cuestas'' and valleys, drained by a system of ''wadis''. A crescent of sand and [[gravel]] deserts lies to the east.

Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making irrigation and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}
During the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|Αραβία}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix &quot;Arabia&quot;, encompassing a larger area than the current term &quot;Arabian Peninsula&quot;:
* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.
* [[Arabia Deserta]] (&quot;Desert Arabia&quot;): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).
* [[Arabia Felix]] (&quot;Fortunate Arabia&quot;): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.

The Arab inhabitants used a north–south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&amp;pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' – Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&amp;pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Arabia 600 AD.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Approximate locations of some of the important tribes and Empire of the Arabian Peninsula around the time that [[Muhammad]] started preaching Islam (approximately 600 CE / 20 BH)]]

The seventh century saw the rise of Islam as the peninsula's dominant religion. The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.

Muhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].

With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or &quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See:

* Lapidus (2002), p.32
* Madelung (1996), p.43
* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or &quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or &quot;rightly guided&quot; Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.&lt;ref&gt;See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;L. Gardet&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Islam|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online|author=L. Gardet|author2=J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] remained the spiritually most important places in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Qur'an]] requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the [[five pillars of Islam]], to make a pilgrimage, or [[Hajj]], to [[Mecca]] during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] at least once in his or her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar (1994). Islam: Beliefs and Observances (5th ed.), pp.145–147 {{ISBN|978-0-8120-1853-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Masjid al-Haram]] (the Grand Mosque) in [[Mecca]] is the location of the [[Kaaba]], Islam's holiest site, and the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] (the Prophet's Mosque) in [[Medina]] is the location of [[Muhammad]] tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt, Jr., Arthur; Lawrence Davidson (2005). A Concise History of the Middle East (8th ed.), p.48 {{ISBN|978-0-8133-4275-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Despite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the [[Islamic world]], in which the most important [[Caliphate|medieval Islamic states]] were based at various times in such far away cities as [[Damascus]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Cairo]].

However, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the [[Hashemite]] [[Sharifs of Mecca]] maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the [[Hejaz]]. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: History of Arabia&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclopædia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

The provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon ([[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate]]). It was put in charge of Syria, Cilicia, Iraq, and the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;see History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Stanford J. Shaw, Ezel Kural Shaw, Cambridge University Press, 1977, {{ISBN|0-521-29166-6}}, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Uxkz9D4Ff_sC&amp;pg=PA417&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;ei=BoDxSP2rFZbMzQTO3MXtBg&amp;client= The Politics of Interventionism in Ottoman Lebanon, 1830–1861, by Caesar E. Farah], explains that Mount Lebanon was in the jurisdiction of the Arabistan Army, and that its headquarters was briefly moved to Beirut.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans never had any control over central Arabia, also known as the [[Najd]] region.

The [[Damascus Protocol]] of 1914 provides an illustration of the regional relationships. Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised [[Cilicia]] – [[İskenderun]] and [[Mersin]], [[Iraq]] with [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;As cited by R, John and S. Hadawi's, Palestine Diary, pp. 30–31, the 'Damascus Protocol' stated: &quot;The recognition by Great Britain of the independence of the Arab countries lying within the following frontiers: North: The Line Mersin_Adana to parallel 37N. and thence along the line Birejek-Urga-Mardin-Kidiat-Jazirat (Ibn 'Unear)-Amadia to the Persian frontier; East: The Persian frontier down to the Persian Gulf; South: The Indian Ocean (with the exclusion of Aden, whose status was to be maintained). West: The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea back to Mersin. The abolition of all exceptional privileges granted to foreigners under the capitulations. The conclusion of a defensive alliance between Great Britain ''and the future independent Arab State''. The grant of economic preference to Great Britain.&quot; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=n706ShSYt-sC&amp;printsec=toc&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0#PPA65,M1 ''King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz''], By Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, pages 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the term bilad al-Yaman came to refer specifically to the southwestern parts of the peninsula. Arab geographers started to refer to the whole peninsula as 'jazirat al-Arab', or the peninsula of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&amp;pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher= University of California Press |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-520-07196-4| pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Ottoman rule and the Hejaz Railway====
[[File:Arabia 1914.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The peninsula in 1914]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting [[Istanbul]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the seat of the Islamic [[Caliphate]], and [[Hejaz]] with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the [[Hajj]]. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.

The [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpaşa Terminal]]).

The railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.&lt;ref&gt;King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====
The major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.

These events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.

====Oil reserves====
The second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].

====Civil war in Yemen====
The [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'état]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.

The royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.

By 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=enein&gt;{{Cite news |issue=Jan–Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Greenwood, Marc Weller, Published by Cambridge University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-521-46308-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[invasion of Kuwait]] by Iraqi forces led to the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]]. [[Egypt]], [[Qatar]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] joined a multinational [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition]] that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by [[Jordan]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called &quot;Damascus Declaration&quot; formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's Bid for Arab Leadership: Implications for U.S. Policy, By Gregory L.

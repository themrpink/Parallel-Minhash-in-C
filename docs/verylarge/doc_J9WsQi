'''Casu martzu''' ({{IPA-srd|ˈkazu ˈmaɾtsu}}; literally 'rotten/putrid cheese'), also called '''casu modde''', '''casu cundídu''' and '''casu fràzigu''' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], is a traditional [[Sardinian cuisine|Sardinian]] [[sheep milk cheese]] that contains live insect [[larva]]e ([[maggot]]s). A variation of the cheese, '''[[:fr:casgiu merzu|casgiu merzu]]''', is also produced in some [[Southern Corsica]]n villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gietaravu.com/fromage/sartenais.htm |title=Fromage corse: le Sartenais |access-date=8 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501023222/http://www.gietaravu.com/fromage/sartenais.htm |archive-date=1 May 2014 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derived from [[pecorino]], casu martzu goes beyond typical [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] to a stage of [[decomposition]], brought about by the [[digestion|digestive]] action of the larvae of the [[Piophila casei|cheese fly]] of the ''[[Piophilidae]]'' family. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese, promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese's [[butterfat|fats]]. The texture of the cheese becomes very soft, with some liquid (called ''làgrima'', Sardinian for &quot;teardrop&quot;) seeping out. The larvae themselves appear as translucent white worms, roughly {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;fly&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Berenbaum|first=May R|title=Ninety-Nine More Maggots, Mites, and Munchers|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1993|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ninetyninemorema00bere/page/10 10–14]|isbn=0-252-06322-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ninetyninemorema00bere/page/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermentation==
Casu martzu is created by leaving whole pecorino cheeses outside with part of the rind removed to allow the eggs of the cheese fly ''Piophila casei'' to be laid in the cheese. A female ''P. casei'' can lay more than 500 eggs at one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;fly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;australia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Top five ... challenging foods; eat, drink, cook ... and be merry|last=Stephens|first=Andrew|date=30 August 2008|work=The Age|page=A2}} Under &quot;Casu martzu&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;/&gt; The acid from the maggots' digestive system breaks down the cheese's [[butterfat|fats]],&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overstreet|first=Robin M|date=December 2003|title=Presidential Address: Flavor Buds and Other Delights|journal=Journal of Parasitology|publisher=American Society of Parasitologists|location=Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada|volume=89|issue=6|pages=1093–1107|url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1645%2FGE-236&amp;ct=1|pmid=14740894|accessdate=6 October 2008|doi=10.1645/GE-236}} Under the &quot;Botflies and other insects&quot; section.&lt;/ref&gt; making the texture of the cheese very soft; by the time it is ready for consumption, a typical Casu Martzu will contain thousands of these maggots.&lt;ref name=&quot;irish&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Maggots, songbirds and other acquired tastes|last=Hegarty|first=Shane|date= 1 April 2006|work=The Irish Times|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumption==
Casu martzu is considered by [[Sardinian people|Sardinian]] aficionados to be unsafe to eat when the maggots in the cheese have died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theoutline.com/post/8843/casu-martzu-cheese-sardinia-illegal-dangerous?zd=2&amp;zi=ayvnl7f5|title=The secret resistance behind the world's most dangerous cheese|author=Mark Hay|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, only cheese in which the maggots are still alive is usually eaten, although allowances are made for cheese that has been refrigerated, which results in the maggots being killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot; /&gt; When the cheese has fermented enough, it is often cut into thin strips and spread on moistened Sardinian flatbread ([[pane carasau]]), to be served with a strong red wine like [[cannonau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bon app&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/bonappetit/features/travel/sardinia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409031053/http://www.epicurious.com/bonappetit/features/travel/sardinia |archivedate=9 April 2006|title=Sardinia, Italy|last=Loomis|first=Susan Herrmann|date=May 2002|work=Bon Appétit |accessdate=8 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Casu martzu is believed to be an [[aphrodisiac]] by [[Sardinians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wallstreet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimov|first=Yaroslav|authorlink=Yaroslav Trofimov|date=23 October 2000|title=As a Cheese Turns, So Turns This Tale Of Many a Maggot --- Crawling With Worms and Illicit, Sardinia's Ripe Pecorinos Fly In the Face of Edible Reason|journal=Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition)|volume=236|issue=37|pages=A1|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} when disturbed,&lt;ref name=&quot;fly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The back pages:  |author=Bethune, Brian|journal=Maclean's |date=16 October 2006|quote=The agile maggots offer an additional frisson: they can bend themselves so tightly that, when they let go, the force unleashed propels them six inches or more.}}&lt;/ref&gt; diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots from leaping. Some who eat the cheese prefer not to ingest the maggots. Those who do not wish to eat them place the cheese in a sealed paper bag. The maggots, starved for oxygen, writhe and jump in the bag, creating a &quot;pitter-patter&quot; sound. When the sounds subside, the maggots are dead and the cheese can be eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;world's worst&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|year=2005|title=The World's Worst: A Guide to the Most Disgusting, Hideous, Inept, and Dangerous People, Places, and Things on Earth|chapter=Most Rotten Cheese|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0-8118-4606-6|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot; /&gt;

==Health concerns==
According to some food scientists, it is possible for the larvae to survive the stomach acid and remain in the intestine, leading to a condition called [[Myiasis#Accidental_myiasis|pseudomyiasis]]. There have been documented cases of pseudomyiasis with ''P. casei''.&lt;ref&gt;Peckenscneider, L.E., Polorny, C. and Hellwig, C.A., 1952 Intestinal infestation with maggots of the cheese fly (Piophila casei). ''J Am Med Assoc''. 1952 May 17;149 (3):262-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/537288|title=Gastrointestinal Myiasis – Report of a case, Alonzo F. Brand, M.D., Arch Intern Med (Chic). 1931;47(1):149–154. doi:10.1001/archinte.1931.00140190160017|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109181904/https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/537288|archive-date=9 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[European Union]] food hygiene-health regulations, the cheese has been outlawed, and offenders face heavy fines.&lt;ref name=&quot;world's worst&quot;/&gt; However, some Sardinians organized themselves in order to make casu martzu available on the [[black market]], where it may be sold for double the price of an ordinary block of [[pecorino]] cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallstreet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot; /&gt;

Attempts have been made to circumvent the Italian and EU ban by having casu martzu declared a traditional food&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot; /&gt; (it has been made in the same manner for more than 25 years, and it is therefore exempt from ordinary [[food hygiene]] regulations). The traditional way of making the cheese is explained by an official paper of the local Sardinian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegnaagricoltura.it/documenti/14_43_20070607153029.pdf |title=Casu frazigu – Formaggi |publisher=Regione autonoma della Sardegna – ERSAT: Ente Regionale di Sviluppo e Assistenza Tecnica |language=Italian |accessdate=29 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051927/http://www.sardegnaagricoltura.it/documenti/14_43_20070607153029.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cooperation between sheep farmers and researchers of the [[University of Sassari]] developed a hygienic method of production, in 2005, aiming to allow the legal selling of the cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubblicitaitalia.com/cocoon/pubit/riviste/articolo.html?Testata=2&amp;idArticolo=8001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516065313/http://www.pubblicitaitalia.com/cocoon/pubit/riviste/articolo.html?Testata=2&amp;idArticolo=8001 |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2013 |title=Edizioni Pubblicità Italia |publisher=Pubblicitaitalia.com |date= |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other regional variations==
Outside of Sardinia, similar milk cheeses are also produced in the French island of Corsica, as a local variation of the Sardinian cheese known as ''casgiu merzu'', as well as in a number of Italian regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comuni italiani|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/14/enogastronomia.html|title=Cacie' punt|accessdate=30 April 2011|work=www.comuni-italiani.it|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207072631/http://www.comuni-italiani.it/14/enogastronomia.html|archive-date=7 February 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prodotti tipici|url=http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0188/formaggio-saltarello.htm|title=Formaggio saltarello|accessdate=30 April 2011|format=PDF|publisher=prodottitipici.com|work=www.prodottitipici.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013928/http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0188/formaggio-saltarello.htm|archive-date=12 December 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prodotti tipici|url=http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/10368/Pecorino-Marcetto.htm|title=Pecorino marcetto|accessdate=30 April 2011|format=PDF|publisher=prodottitipici.com|work=www.prodottitipici.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013933/http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/10368/Pecorino-Marcetto.htm|archive-date=12 December 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other regional varieties of cheese with fly larvae are produced in the rest of Europe. For example, goat-milk cheese is left to the open air until ''P. casei'' eggs are naturally laid in the cheese.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;/&gt; Then it is aged in white wine, with grapes and honey, preventing the larvae from emerging, giving the cheese a strong flavour. In addition, other regions in Europe have traditional cheeses that rely on live [[arthropod]]s for ageing and flavouring, such as the German ''[[Milbenkäse]]'' and French ''[[Mimolette]]'', both of which rely on [[cheese mite]]s.

An early printed reference to [[Stilton cheese]] points to a similar production technique. [[Daniel Defoe]] in his 1724 work ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'' notes, &quot;We pass'd Stilton, a town famous for cheese, which is call'd our English [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan]], and is brought to table with the [[mite]]s or [[maggot]]s round it, so thick, that they bring a spoon with them for you to eat the mites with, as you do the cheese.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Everyman's Library (London/New York: Dent/Dutton, 1928), Vol. II, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Makings of a Modern Newspaper- the Production of 'The Daily Mail' in Wartime, London, UK, 1944 D20472.jpg|thumb|Linotype operators preparing hot-metal type 'slugs' to be assembled in columns and pages by hand [[Typesetting#Manual typesetting|compositors]]. This [[letterpress]] mode of newspaper production was supplanted in the 1970s and 1980s by the cleaner, more economical [[Lithography#Modern lithographic process|offset litho]] process.]]

The '''history of British newspapers''' dates to the 17th century with the emergence of regular publications covering news and gossip. The relaxation of government censorship in the late 17th century led to a rise in publications, which in turn led to an increase in regulation throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref name=NMtimeline&gt;{{cite web |title=History of British newspapers |url=http://www.newsmediauk.org/History-of-British-Newspapers |website=News Media Association |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' began publication in 1785 and became the leading newspaper of the early 19th century, before the lifting of taxes on newspapers and technological innovations led to a boom in newspaper publishing in the late 19th century. Mass education and increasing affluence led to new papers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' emerging at the end of the 19th century, aimed at lower middle-class readers.

In the early 20th century the British press was dominated by a few wealthy [[press baron]]s. Many papers published more popular and interesting stories in an attempt to boost circulation which includes sports and other features. In 1969 [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought and relaunched ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' as a tabloid and soon added pictures of topless models on [[Page 3]]. Within a few years the Sun was the UK's most popular newspaper.

In the 1980s national newspapers began to move out of [[Fleet Street]], the traditional home of the British national press since the 18th century. By the early 21st century newspaper circulation began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Tobitt |first1=Charlotte |title=National newspaper ABCs |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/national-newspaper-abcs-industry-wide-circulation-decline-continues-as-metro-and-sun-top-the-table/ |accessdate=10 November 2018 |magazine=Press Gazette |date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2010s many British newspapers were implicated in a major [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]] which led to the closure of the ''[[News of the World]]'' after 168 years of publication and the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into press standards.&lt;ref name=NMtimeline /&gt;

==17th century==
During the 17th century there were many kinds of news publications that told both the news and rumours, such as [[pamphlet]]s, [[poster]]s and [[Broadside ballads|ballads]]. Even when news periodicals emerged, many of these co-existed with them. A news periodical differs from these mainly because of its periodicity. The definition for 17th century [[newsbook]]s and [[newspapers]] is that they are published at least once a week. [[Johann Carolus]]' ''Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien'', published in [[Strassburg]] in 1605, is usually regarded as the first news periodical.&lt;ref&gt;World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html &quot;Newspapers: 400 Years Young!&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=10 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 17th century, the right to print was strictly controlled in England. This was probably the reason why the first newspaper in the English language was printed in Rome by [[Joris Veseler]] around 1620. This followed the style established by Veseler's earlier Dutch paper ''[[Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &amp;c.]]'' However, when the English started printing their own papers in [[London]], they reverted to the pamphlet format used by contemporary books. The publication of these newsbooks was suspended between 1632 and 1638 by order of the [[Star Chamber]].  After they resumed publication, the era of these newsbooks lasted until the publication of the ''[[The London Gazette|Oxford Gazette]]'' in 1665.

The control over printing relaxed greatly after the abolition of the [[Star Chamber]] in 1641. The [[English civil war|Civil War]] escalated the demand for news. News pamphlets or books reported the war, often supporting one side or the other. A number of publications arose after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], including the ''[[London Gazette]]'' (first published on 16 November 1665 as the ''Oxford Gazette''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/1/pages/1 London-gazette.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; the first official [[journal of record]] and the newspaper of the Crown. Publication was controlled under the Licensing Act of 1662, but the Act's lapses from 1679 to 1685 and from 1695 onwards encouraged a number of new titles.

''[[Mercurius Caledonius]]'' founded in [[Edinburgh]] in 1660, was [[Scotland]]'s first but short-lived newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | title = The previous incarnations of the Caledonian Mercury | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140227052423/http://caledonianmercury.com/2010/01/24/the-previous-incarnations-of-the-caledonian-mercury/001099 | archivedate = 27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 12 editions were published during 1660 and 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/rarebooks/collections/newspapers.html|title=Rare Books Collections - Newspapers|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Daily Courant plaque London.jpg|thumb|This plaque in London marks the publication in 1702 of ''The Daily Courant'' as London's first daily newspaper]]
There were twelve London newspapers and 24 provincial papers by the 1720s (the ''[[Daily Courant]]'' was the first daily newspaper in London). The ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' was started by Henry Woodfall in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The first English journalist to achieve national importance was [[Daniel Defoe]]. In February 1704, he began his weekly, ''The Review'', which was eventually printed three times a week and was a forerunner of ''The Tatler'' (started by [[Richard Steele]] in 1709) and ''The Spectator'' (started by Steele and [[Joseph Addison]] in 1711). Defoe's ''Review'' came to an end in 1713. Between 1716 and 1720 he published a monthly newspaper with old style title, ''Mercurius Politicus.'' ''The Examiner'' started in 1710 as the chief Conservative political mouthpiece, which enjoyed as its most influential contributor, [[Jonathan Swift]]. Swift had control of the journal for 33 issues between November 1710 and June 1711, but once he became dean of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Dublin, he gave up regular journalistic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kevin|title=Read All About It: a History of the British Newspaper|year=2010|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1702 [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], the virtual founder of the famous &quot;[[Lloyd's]]&quot; of commerce, started a thrice a week newspaper, ''Lloyd's News'', which had but a brief existence in its initial form, but was the precursor of the modern ''[[Lloyd's List]]''. The 76th issue of the original paper contained a paragraph mentioning the House of Lords, for which the publisher was told he would have to pay a fine. He preferred to discontinue his publication instead. In 1726 he in part revived it, under the title of ''Lloyd's List'', published at first weekly, it would later become a daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Curan|title=Newspaper History. Seventeenth Century to the Present|year=1978|location=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' was published out of [[Edinburgh]], [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]]. Its first issue was dated 14-19 Feb 1705 and was sold for a [[penny]]. It was one of the country's first regional papers, second only to the [[Norwich Post]] (1701). The paper was produced twice weekly for five years, then continued as the ''Scots Courant'' until April 1720. Later that same year, the ''Edinburgh Evening Courant'' began publication, and it survived until the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]]'' came into existence in 1873.

The increasing popularity and influence of newspapers was problematic to the government of the day. The first bill in parliament advocating a [[tax on newspapers]] was proposed in 1711. The duty eventually imposed in 1712 was a halfpenny on papers of half a sheet or less and a penny on newspapers that ranged from half a sheet to a single sheet in size. Jonathan Swift expressed in his  ''Journal to Stella'' on 7 August 1712, doubt in the ability of ''The Spectator'' to hold out against the tax. This doubt was proved justified in December 1712 by its discontinuance. However, some of the existing journals continued production and their numbers soon increased. Part of this increase was attributed to corruption and political connections of its owners. Later, toward the middle of the same century, the provisions and the penalties of the [[Stamp Act]] were made more stringent, yet the number of newspapers continued to rise. In 1753 the total number of copies of newspapers sold yearly in Britain amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790 and in 1767 to 11,300,980. In 1776 the number of newspapers published in London alone had increased to 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Hannah|title=Newspapers, Politics and English Society|year=1999|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The News Letter]]'' is one of [[Northern Ireland]]'s main daily newspapers, published Monday to Saturday. It is the oldest English-language general daily newspaper still in publication in the world, having first been printed in 1737.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/libraries/research/guides/s-irishnews/ Research guide: Irish news &amp; newspapers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809020149/http://www.bc.edu/libraries/research/guides/s-irishnews/ |date=9 August 2007 }}, [[Boston College]], 13 December 2004, accessed 25 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Johnston, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/belfast/newsletter.shtml Your place and mine: Belfast News Letter], [[BBC]], accessed 25 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published three times weekly, it became daily in 1855.

The 18th century saw the gradual development of the purely political journal side by side with those papers which were primarily devoted to news, domestic and foreign, and commerce. It was left to Steele and Addison to develop the social side of journalism in their respective papers. In 1761 the ''North Briton'' came out and it was largely a result of its publisher, [[John Wilkes]], and his campaign for increased freedom of the press that, in 1772 the right to publish parliamentary reports was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Alexander|title=A History of British Journalism|year=2011|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Observer]]'', first published on 4 December 1791, was the world's first [[Sunday newspaper]].

==19th century==
By the early 19th century, there were 52 London papers and over 100 other titles. As stamp, paper and other duties were progressively reduced from the 1830s onwards (all duties on newspapers were gone by 1855) there was a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public's need for information. ''The Daily Universal Register'' began life in 1785 and was later to become known as ''[[The Times]]'' from 1788. This was the most significant newspaper of the first half of the 19th century, but from around 1860 there were a number of more strongly competitive titles, each differentiated by its political biases and interests.

In 1802 and 1815 the tax on newspapers was increased to three pence and then four pence. Unable or unwilling to pay this fee, between 1831 and 1835 hundreds of untaxed newspapers made their appearance. The political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary. Their publishers were prosecuted but this failed to discourage untaxed newspapers. It was chiefly Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden who advocated the case in parliament to first reduce in 1836 and, in 1855, totally repeal the tax on newspapers. The development of the press was greatly assisted by the gradual abolition of the taxes on periodicals as well as by the introduction of a cheap postal system. Both of these developments made the newspaper more affordable to a greater percentage of the population. The burden of the newspaper tax on publishers was heavy, resulting in 29,400,000 tax stamps being issued in 1820. In 1828 the proprietor of ''[[The Times]]'' had to pay the state more than £68,000 in taxes. After the reduction of the stamp tax in 1836 from four pence to one penny, the circulation of English newspapers rose from 39,000,000 to 122,000,000 by 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Brian|title=British Newspapers: A History and Guide|year=1984|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major papers===
''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'' is a newspaper published by [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co.]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland. It had five daily editions for Dundee, Fife, Perth and Angus. It was established in 1801 as the ''Dundee Courier &amp; Argus''. Like most papers the entire front page was devoted to classified advertisements; ''The Courier'' was unusual in maintaining this format until 1992, before adopting the headline-news format.

''[[Seren Gomer]]'' was a [[Welsh language]] periodical founded in 1814 by the clergyman and writer [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)]], the first Welsh-language newspaper.

The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' was founded in Manchester in 1821 by a group of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] businessmen. Its most famous editor, [[Charles Prestwich Scott]], made the ''Manchester Guardian'' into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s. It is now called ''The Guardian'' and published in London.

''[[The Scotsman]]'' was launched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/help/about |title=The Scotsman Archive – 25 January 1817 (page 1 of 8) – The Scotsman launched |work=The Scotsman |location=UK  |accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer [[William Ritchie (Newspaper Editor)|William Ritchie]] and [[customs]] official [[Charles Maclaren]] in response to the &quot;unblushing subservience&quot; of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment.  The paper was pledged to &quot;impartiality, firmness and independence&quot;. Its modern editorial line is firmly anti-independence. After the abolition of newspaper [[stamp tax]] in Scotland in 1855, ''The Scotsman'' was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at [[£sd|1d]] and a circulation of 6,000 copies.

The [[Chartism|Chartist]] ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'', first published on 26 May 1838, was a pioneer of popular journalism but was very closely linked to the fortunes of the movement and was out of business by 1852. At the same time there was the establishment of more specialised periodicals and the first cheap newspaper in the ''Daily Telegraph and Courier'' (1855), later to be known simply as the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. 
[[File:Telegraph29061855.jpg|thumb|1855 first edition of the ''Daily Telegraph &amp; Courier'']]
''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was first published on 29 June 1855 and was owned by [[Arthur B. Sleigh|Arthur Sleigh]], who transferred it to [[Joseph Moses Levy|Joseph Levy]] the following year. Levy produced it as the first penny newspaper in London. His son, Edward Lawson soon became editor, a post he held until 1885. ''The Daily Telegraph'' became the organ of the middle class and could claim the largest circulation in the world in 1890. It held a consistent Liberal Party allegiance until opposing Gladstone's foreign policy in 1878 when it turned Unionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franklin|first=Bob|title=Pulling Newspapers Apart|url=https://archive.org/details/pullingnewspaper00fran|url-access=limited|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pullingnewspaper00fran/page/n303 292]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', founded in 1842, was the world's first illustrated weekly newspaper. [[Mason Jackson]], its art editor for thirty years, published in 1885 ''The Pictorial Press'', a history of illustrated newspapers. ''The Illustrated London News'' was published weekly until 1971 when it became monthly; bimonthly from 1989; and then quarterly before publication ceased.

The ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' was founded in [[Cardiff]] in 1869&lt;ref&gt;''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. John Davies, [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg615 {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]] as a penny daily paper. It describes itself as &quot;the national newspaper of Wales&quot; (originally &quot;the national newspaper of Wales and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]&quot;), although it has a very limited circulation in [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlga.gov.uk/download.php?id=767&amp;l=1 Minutes of the Welsh Local Government Association Co-ordinating Committee, 26 March 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217150921/http://www.wlga.gov.uk/download.php?id=767&amp;l=1 |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 until around 1910 is considered a 'golden age' of newspaper publication, with technical advances in printing and communication combined with a professionalisation of journalism and the prominence of new owners. Newspapers became more partisan and there was the rise of new or yellow journalism (see [[William Thomas Stead]]).  Socialist and labour newspapers also proliferated and in 1912 the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' was launched as the first daily newspaper of the [[trade union]] and labour movement.

The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' was first published in 1896 by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]. It became Britain's second biggest-selling daily newspaper, outsold only by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pressgazette1&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gazette |first=Press |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=48913&amp;c=1 |title=First official figures give The Sun Sunday 3.2m circ |magazine=Press Gazette |accessdate=2012-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310112424/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=48913&amp;c=1 |archivedate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mail'' was Britain's first daily newspaper aimed at the newly literate &quot;lower-middle class market resulting from [[Elementary Education Act 1870|mass education]], combining a low retail price with plenty of competitions, prizes and promotional gimmicks&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul2001&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3l_wD4Nq40YC&amp;pg=PA83 |title=News and news sources |author=Paul Manning | isbn=978-0-7619-5797-3 | year=2001 | publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first British paper to sell a million copies a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;1millionaday&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.eurocosm.com/Application/Products/Original-newspapers/newspaper-history-GB.asp |title=Milestones in 20th Century Newspaper history in Britain |publisher=Eurocosm UK |accessdate=12 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420114901/http://www.eurocosm.com/Application/Products/Original-newspapers/newspaper-history-GB.asp |archivedate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, from the outset, a newspaper for women, being the first to provide features especially for them,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WQUoyZ9DPpAC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22daily+mail%22+%22newspaper+for+women%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5E1fT_yUGuiw2wXIvJCACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage Newsmen speak: journalists on their craft] Edmo nd D.

===Style===
With literacy rising sharply, the rapidly growing demand for news led to changes in the physical size, visual appeal, heavy use of war reporting, brisk writing style, and an omnipresent emphasis on speedy reporting thanks to the telegraph. Critics noted how London was echoing the emerging New York style of journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Joel H. Wiener, ''The Americanization of the British Press, 1830s-1914: Speed in the Age of Transatlantic Journalism'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The new news writing style first spread to the provincial press through the ''Midland Daily Telegraph'' around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Matthews, &quot;The emergence of the news paradigm in the English provincial press: A case study of the Midland Daily Telegraph.&quot; ''Journal of Historical Pragmatics'' (2014) 15#2 pp: 165-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers increasingly made their profit from selling advertising. In the 1850s and 1860s the ads appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, &quot;Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71.&quot; ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
After the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race. The political parties, which long had sponsored their own papers, could not keep up, and one after another their outlets were sold or closed down.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen E. Koss]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:471-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base.  The niche was dominated by ''[[The Times]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].''  Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London.   James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] report: 		
: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men, Lords [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] (1879-1964), [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] (1868-1940), [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Camrose]] (1879-1954) and [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Kemsley]] (1883-1968)–became the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Curran|author2=Jean Seaton|title=Power Without Responsibility: Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM6OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|date= 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' was long the most influential prestige newspaper, although far from having the largest circulation. It gave far more attention to serious political and cultural news.&lt;ref&gt;Koss, ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:516-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever|John Jacob Astor]] (1886-1971), son of the [[William Waldorf Astor|1st Viscount Astor]] (1849-1919), bought ''The Times'' from the [[Alfred Harmsworth|Northcliffe estate]]. The paper advocated [[appeasement]] of Hitler's demands.  Its editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]], and pushed hard for the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938.  Candid news reports by [[Norman Ebbutt]] from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.  In March 1939, however, it reversed course and called for urgent war preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel, ed. ''The Times and Appeasement: The Journals of A L Kennedy, 1932-1939'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McDonough, &quot;The Times, Norman Ebbut and the Nazis, 1927-37.&quot; ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 27#3 (1992): 407-424.

==Coronations==
[[File:SanktEdvardsstol westminster.jpg|thumb|[[King Edward's Chair]]]]
{{Main|Coronation of the British monarch|List of British coronations}}

Since the coronation in 1066 of [[William the Conqueror]], every English and British monarch (except [[Edward V]] and [[Edward VIII]], who were never crowned) has been crowned in Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coronations&quot;/&gt; In 1216, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] could not be crowned in London when he came to the throne, because the French prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]] had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. This coronation was deemed by Pope [[Honorius III]] to be improper, and a further coronation was held in Westminster Abbey on 17 May 1220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry3.php|title=Henry III, Archonotology.org|accessdate=21 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422015534/http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry3.php|archive-date=22 April 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Edward's Chair]] (or St Edward's Chair), the throne on which English and British sovereigns have been seated at the moment of crowning, is now housed within the Abbey in St George's Chapel near the West Door, and has been used at every coronation since 1308. From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950 when the stone was temporarily stolen by [[Scottish nationalist]]s), the chair also housed the [[Stone of Scone]] upon which the kings of Scots are crowned. Although the Stone is now kept in Scotland, in [[Edinburgh Castle]], it is intended that the Stone will be returned to St Edward's Chair for use during future coronation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38064299 |title=The Stone still waiting for its final destiny |work=BBC |date=28 November 2016 |access-date=2017-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215032752/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38064299 |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] rebuilt the abbey in honour of a royal saint, [[Edward the Confessor]], whose relics were placed in a [[shrine]] in the sanctuary. Henry III himself was interred nearby, as were many of the [[Plantagenet]] kings of England, their wives and other relatives. Until the death of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1760, most kings and queens were buried in the abbey, some notable exceptions being [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] who are buried in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]]. Other exceptions include [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] buried at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], [[John, King of England|John]] buried at [[Worcester Cathedral]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] buried at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], now buried at [[Leicester Cathedral]], and the ''de facto'' queen [[Lady Jane Grey]], buried in the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] in the [[Tower of London]]. More recently monarchs have been buried either in St George's Chapel or at [[Frogmore]] to the east of Windsor Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardens-to-visit/a-look-around-frogmore-the-royals-secret-garden-which-opens-to-t/|title=A look around Frogmore, the Royals' secret garden, which opens to the public this week|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=4 June 2016|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729012937/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardens-to-visit/a-look-around-frogmore-the-royals-secret-garden-which-opens-to-t/|archive-date=29 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Middle Ages, aristocrats were buried inside chapels, while monks and other people associated with the abbey were buried in the [[cloister]]s and other areas. One of these was [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who was buried here as he had apartments in the abbey where he was employed as master of the King's Works. Other poets, writers and musicians were buried or memorialised around Chaucer in what became known as [[Poets' Corner]]. Abbey musicians such as [[Henry Purcell]] were also buried in their place of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/henry-purcell2|title=Henry Purcell &amp; family|website=www.westminster-abbey.org|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031303/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/henry-purcell2|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, it became one of Britain's most significant honours to be buried or commemorated in the abbey.&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Another was [[William Wilberforce]] who led the movement to abolish slavery in the United Kingdom and the Plantations, buried on 3 August 1833. Wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend, the former Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/william-wilberforce |title=William Wilberforce &amp; family |publisher=Westminster-abbey.org |date=2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811144431/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/william-wilberforce |archive-date=11 August 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 20th century it became increasingly common to bury [[cremation|cremated]] remains rather than coffins in the abbey. In 1905 the actor [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]] was cremated and his ashes buried in Westminster Abbey, thereby becoming the first person ever to be cremated prior to interment at the abbey.&lt;ref name=CremSoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|title=Woking Crematorium|work=Internet|publisher=The Cremation Society of Great Britain|accessdate=28 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803051500/http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|archive-date=3 August 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of interments at the Abbey are of cremated remains, but some burials still take place – Frances Challen, wife of Sebastian Charles, [[Canon of Westminster]], was buried alongside her husband in the south choir aisle in 2014.&lt;ref name=SCharles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/sebastian-charles|title=Sebastian Charles|work=Internet|publisher=The Dean and Chapter of Westminster|accessdate=19 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104550/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/sebastian-charles|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Duke of Northumberland|Percy family]] have a family vault, [[The Northumberland Vault]], in St Nicholas's chapel within the abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/elizabeth,-duchess-of-northumberland|title=Westminster Abbey &quot; Elizabeth, Duchess of Northumberland &amp; Percy family|access-date=30 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231055947/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/elizabeth,-duchess-of-northumberland|archive-date=31 December 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the floor, just inside the Great West Door, in the centre of the nave, is the tomb of [[The Unknown Warrior]], an unidentified British soldier killed on a European battlefield during the [[First World War]]. He was buried in the abbey on 11 November 1920. This grave is the only one in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://branches.britishlegion.org.uk/branches/shipston/remembrance/the-tomb-of-the-unknown-warrior/ |title=The Tomb of The Unknown Warrior |publisher=British Legion |access-date=29 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920143858/http://branches.britishlegion.org.uk/branches/shipston/remembrance/the-tomb-of-the-unknown-warrior/ |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the east end of the Lady Chapel is a memorial chapel to the airmen of the [[Royal Air Force]] who were killed in the [[Second World War]]. It incorporates a memorial window to the [[Battle of Britain]], which replaces an earlier Tudor stained glass window destroyed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/abbey-treasures/the-royal-air-force-chapel|title=The Royal Air Force Chapel|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922171704/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/abbey-treasures/the-royal-air-force-chapel|archive-date=22 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diana's funeral.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession of Diana, Princess of Wales, at Westminster]]
On 6 September 1997 the formal, though not &quot;state&quot; [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]], was held. It was a royal ceremonial funeral including royal pageantry and Anglican funeral liturgy. A second public service was held on Sunday at the demand of the people. The burial occurred privately later the same day. Diana's former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]], which she had chosen some weeks before. A set of rosary beads was placed in her hands, a gift she had received from [[Mother Teresa]], who died a day before Diana's funeral. Her grave is on the grounds of her family estate, [[Althorp]], on a private island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/althorp.html |title=Diana Returns Home |work=BBC News |date=1997 |accessdate=21 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025075722/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/althorp.html |archive-date=25 October 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 ten vacant statue niches on the façade above the Great West Door were filled with representative [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials#20th Century Martyrs|20th-century Christian martyrs]] of various denominations.

The Choir School educates and trains the choirboys who sing for services in the Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/2017/09/interview-jonathan-milton/|title=Making all the right noises: An Interview with Jonathan Milton, headmaster of the Westminster Abbey Choir School|date=15 September 2017|publisher=KCW Today|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110190946/http://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/2017/09/interview-jonathan-milton/|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Westminster Abbey is renowned for its choral tradition, and the repertoire of [[Anglican church music]] is heard in daily worship, particularly at the service of [[Choral Evensong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westminster Abbey : Choral Evensong|url=https://www.choralevensong.org/westminster-abbey-15.php|website=choralevensong.org|accessdate=12 October 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012202102/https://www.choralevensong.org/westminster-abbey-15.php|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choral services|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/music/choral-services|website=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013009/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/music/choral-services|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organ===
{{See also|List of Westminster Abbey organists}}
The organ was built by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]] in 1937, then with four manuals and 84 speaking stops, and was used for the first time at the coronation of [[King George VI]]. Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was revoiced and incorporated in the new scheme. The two organ cases, designed and built in the late 19th century by [[John Loughborough Pearson]], were re-instated and coloured in 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&amp;rec_index=N00646 |title=N00646 |publisher=Npor.org.uk |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 and 1987, Harrison and Harrison enlarged the organ under the direction of the then abbey organist [[Simon Preston]] to include an additional Lower Choir Organ and a Bombarde Organ: the current instrument now has five manuals and 109 speaking stops. In 2006, the console of the organ was refurbished by Harrison and Harrison, and space was prepared for two additional 16&amp;nbsp;ft stops on the Lower Choir Organ and the Bombarde Organ.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The current [[Organist and Master of the Choristers]], [[James O'Donnell (organist)|James O'Donnell]], has been in post since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=odonnell|title=James O'Donnell (conductor)|publisher=Hyperion Records|accessdate=24 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408172225/http://hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=odonnell|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bells==
The bells at the abbey were overhauled in 1971. The [[ring of bells|ring]] is now made up of ten bells, hung for [[change ringing]], cast in 1971 by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], tuned to the notes: F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D. The Tenor bell in D (588.5&amp;nbsp;Hz) has a weight of 30&amp;nbsp;cwt, 1&amp;nbsp;qtr, 15&amp;nbsp;lb (3403&amp;nbsp;lb or 1544&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=westminster&amp;numPerPage=10&amp;Submit=++Go++&amp;searchAmount=%3D&amp;searchMetric=cwt&amp;sortBy=Place&amp;sortDir=Asc&amp;DoveID=WESTMINS+A Westminster—Collegiate Church of S Peter (Westminster Abbey)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816141344/https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=westminster&amp;numPerPage=10&amp;Submit=++Go++&amp;searchAmount=%253D&amp;searchMetric=cwt&amp;sortBy=Place&amp;sortDir=Asc&amp;DoveID=WESTMINS+A |date=16 August 2019 }}, [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]], 25 October 2006. Retrieved 16 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition there are two service bells, cast by Robert Mot, in 1585 and 1598 respectively, a Sanctus bell cast in 1738 by [[Richard Phelps (bell-founder)|Richard Phelps]] and Thomas Lester and two unused bells – one cast about 1320, by the successor to R de Wymbish, and a second cast in 1742, by Thomas Lester.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The two service bells and the 1320 bell, along with a fourth small silver &quot;dish bell&quot;, kept in the refectory, have been noted as being of historical importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchcare.co.uk/bells.php|title=Database of Historically Significant Bells and Bell Frames|work=Churchcare website|quote=search on &quot;Westminster Abbey&quot; for bell details|publisher=[[Church of England]]|date=1 April 2008|accessdate=16 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729191709/http://www.churchcare.co.uk/bells.php|archivedate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapter house==
[[File:London_-_Westminster_abbey_-_chapter_house_03.jpg|thumb|upright|The chapter house]]

The [[chapter house]] was built concurrently with the east parts of the abbey under Henry III, between about 1245 and 1253.&lt;ref name=Scott1863&gt;{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gleaningsfromwe01scotgoog/page/n93 41]–43, 56–58|url=https://archive.org/details/gleaningsfromwe01scotgoog|title=Gleanings from Westminster abbey|publisher=J. Henry and J. Parker|author1=Scott|first1=Sir George Gilbert|year=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] in 1872. The entrance is approached from the east cloister walk and includes a double doorway with a large tympanum above.&lt;ref name=Scott1863/&gt;

Inner and outer vestibules lead to the octagonal chapter house, which is of exceptional architectural purity. It is built in a Geometrical Gothic style with an octagonal crypt below. A pier of eight shafts carries the vaulted ceiling. To the sides are blind arcading, remains of 14th-century paintings and numerous stone benches above which are innovatory large 4-light quatre-foiled windows.&lt;ref name=Scott1863/&gt; These are virtually contemporary with the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris.&lt;ref name=Scott1863/&gt;

The chapter house has an original mid-13th-century tiled pavement. A door within the vestibule dates from around 1050 and is believed to be the oldest in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1003579|desc=The Chapter House and Pyx Chamber in the abbey cloisters, Westminster Abbey|accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior includes flying buttresses added in the 14th century and a leaded tent-lantern roof on an iron frame designed by Scott. The Chapter house was originally used in the 13th century by Benedictine monks for daily meetings. It later became a meeting place of the King's Great Council and the Commons, predecessors of Parliament.&lt;ref name=eh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chapter-house-and-pyx-chamber/|title=Chapter house and Pyx Chamber|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221719/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chapter-house-and-pyx-chamber/|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pyx Chamber formed the undercroft of the monks' dormitory. It dates to the late 11th century and was used as a monastic and royal treasury. The outer walls and circular piers are of 11th-century date, several of the capitals were enriched in the 12th century and the stone altar added in the 13th century. The term ''pyx'' refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the [[Trial of the Pyx]], in which newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/history-of-the-trial-of-the-pyx/|title=History of the Trial of the Pyx|publisher=The Royal Mint|accessdate=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728221525/https://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/history-of-the-trial-of-the-pyx/|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter house and Pyx Chamber at Westminster Abbey are in the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.&lt;ref name=eh/&gt;

==Museum==
The [[Westminster Abbey Museum]] was located in the 11th-century [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] [[undercroft]] beneath the former monks' dormitory in Westminster Abbey. This was one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating back almost to the foundation of the church by [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1065. This space had been used as a museum since 1908&lt;ref&gt;Trowles 2008, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; but was closed to the public in June 2018, when it was replaced as a museum by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries, high up in the Abbey [[triforium]].&lt;ref name=gallery/&gt;

In 1952, Rossellini directed Bergman in ''[[Europa '51]]'', where she plays Irene Girard who is distraught by the sudden death of his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Europe '51|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28108-europe-51|access-date=17 October 2020|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband played by [[Alexander Knox]] soon cope, but Irene seems to need a purpose in life to assuage her guilt of neglecting her son.&lt;ref name=Mermelstein&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mermelstein|first=David|date=18 December 2013|title=A Rossellini-Bergman Boxed Set From Criterion Is Reviewed|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304355104579234011374340976.html|access-date=18 October 2020|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossellini directed her in a brief segment of his 1953 documentary film, [[We, the Women|''Siamo donne'' (''We, the Women'')]], which was devoted to film actresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bondanella&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}} His biographer, Peter Bondanella, notes that problems with communication during their marriage may have inspired his films' central themes of &quot;solitude, grace, and spirituality in a world without moral values&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bondanella&quot; /&gt;{{rp|19}} In December 1953, Rossellini directed her in the play ''[[Joan of Arc at the Stake]]'' in Naples, Italy. They took the play to Barcelona, London, Paris and Stockholm. &lt;ref name=&quot;Leamer&quot; /&gt; Her performance received generally good reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Their following effort was ''[[Viaggio in Italia]] (Journey to Italy)''  in 1954. It follows a couple's journey to Naples, Italy to sell off an inherited house. Trapped in a lifeless marriage, they are further unnerved by the locals' way of living. &lt;ref name=Mermelstein/&gt; According to John Patterson of ''The Guardian'', the film started The French New Wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|date=6 May 2013|title=Journey To Italy: the Italian film that kickstarted the French New Wave|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/06/journey-to-italy-roberto-rossellini|access-date=17 October 2020|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Scorsese]] picked this film to be among his favorites in his documentary short in 2001. On 17 February 1955, ''Joan at the Stake'' opened at the Stockholm Opera House. The play was attended by the prime minister and other theatrical figures in Sweden. ''Swedish Daily'' reported that Bergman seems vague, cool and lack of charisma. Bergman was hurt by mostly negative reviews from the media of her native land. Stig Ahlgren was the most harsh when he labelled her a clever businesswoman, not an actress. &quot;Ingrid is a commodity, a desirable commodity which is offered in the free market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Another effort they released that year was ''[[Giovanna d'Arco al rogo]].''&lt;ref name= Weedman&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weedman|first=Christopher|title=Melodramatic Postwar Confessions: Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini's La Paura (1954) – Senses of Cinema|url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2015/cteq/la-paura-roberto-rossellini/|access-date=18 October 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their final effort in 1955 was [[Fear (1954 film)|''La Paura'' (''Fear'')]], based on a play by Austro-Jewish writer Stefan Zweig's 1920 novella ''Angst'' about adultery and blackmail. &lt;ref name= Weedman/&gt; In ''Fear'', Bergman plays a businesswoman, who runs a pharmaceutical company founded by her husband ([[Mathias Wieman]]). She is having an affair with a man whose ex-lover, turns up and blackmails her. The woman demands money, threatening to tell her husband about the affair if Bergman doesn't pay her off.

Rossellini's use of a Hollywood star in his typically &quot;neorealist&quot; films, in which he normally used non-professional actors, provoked some negative reactions in certain circles.{{Vague|date=October 2020}}&lt;!-- Which &quot;negative reactions&quot;?

While the movies Bergman made with Rossellini were commercial failures, somehow the films have garnered a great appreciation and attention in the recent times. According to Jordan Cronk in his article reviewing the movies, their work has inspired a beginning of a modern cinematic era. Rossellini's films during the Bergman era ponder issues of complex psychology as depicted by Bergman in films like ''Stromboli'', ''Europa '51'' and ''Journey to Italy''.&lt;ref name=Cronk&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cronk|first=Jordan|title=Review: 3 Films by Roberto Rossellini Starring Ingrid Bergman on Criterion Blu-ray|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/3-films-by-roberto-rossellini-starring-ingrid-bergman/|access-date=18 October 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Bergman and Rossellini's partnership can be felt in the movies by Godard, Fellini and Antonioni to more recently, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan.&lt;ref name=Cronk/&gt; David Kehr from ''The New York Times'' commented that their works now stand as one of the pioneering works whose influence can be felt in European modern filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=27 September 2013|title=Rossellini and Bergman's Break From Tradition (Published 2013)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/movies/homevideo/ingrid-bergman-in-3-rossellini-films-from-criterion.html|access-date=18 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After separating from Rossellini, Bergman starred in [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Elena and Her Men]]'' (''Elena et les Hommes'', 1956), a romantic comedy in which she played a Polish princess caught up in political intrigue. Bergman and Renoir had been wanting to work together. In ''Elena and Her Men'', in which Renoir written for her, she plays a down-on-her-luck Polish princess, Elena Sorokowska. The film was a hit in Paris when it premiered in September 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sorrento|first=Matthew|title=A Star's New Stage: Elena and Her Men (Elena et les Hommes) – Senses of Cinema|url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2015/cteq/elena-and-her-men/|access-date=16 October 2020|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candice Russell, commented that Bergman is the best thing in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Writer|first=CANDICE RUSSELL, Film|title=BERGMAN BEST THING ABOUT 'ELENA'|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1986-10-03-8602280324-story.html|access-date=16 October 2020|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The movie is about something else - about Bergman's rare eroticism, and the way her face seems to have an inner light on film.

In 1956, Bergman also starred in a French adaptation of stage production of [[Tea and Sympathy (play)|''Tea and Sympathy'']]. It was presented at the [[Théâtre de Paris]], [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/04/archives/miss-bergman-on-stage-bows-in-french-adaptation-of-tea-and-sympathy.html &quot;Miss Bergman On Stage; Bows in French Adaptation of 'Tea and Sympathy' in Paris&quot;] ''The New York Times'', 4 December 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFe1HuVWVQwC&amp;q=Paris+Bergman+%22Tea+and+Sympathy+%22&amp;pg=PA208|title=Tea and Sympathy|work=The Complete Films of Ingrid Bergman|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0806509723|pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells a story of a &quot;boarding school boy&quot; who is thought to be homosexual. Bergman played the wife of the headmaster. She is supportive of the young man, grows closer to him and later has sex with him, as a way to &quot;prove&quot; and support his masculinity. It was a smash hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Twentieth Century Fox had bought the rights to ''Anastasia'' with [[Anatole Litvak]] slated to direct. [[Buddy Adler]], the executive producer wanted Bergman, then a still controversial figure in the States, to return to the American screen after a seven-year absence. Fox agreed to take a chance, making her a box-office risk to play the leading role. Filming was going to be made in England, Paris, and Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anastasia|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67292/anastasia|access-date=16 October 2020|website=tcm.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956) tells the story of a woman who may be the sole surviving member of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family. [[Yul Brynner]] is the scheming general, who tries to pass her off as the single surviving daughter of the late [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]].

Bosley Crowther wrote in the ''New York Times'', &quot;It is a beautifully molded performance, worthy of an Academy Award and particularly gratifying in the light of Miss Bergman's long absence from commendable films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=14 December 1956|title=The Screen: 'Anastasia'; Miss Bergman Excels in Notable Film (Published 1956)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/14/archives/the-screen-anastasia-miss-bergman-excels-in-notable-film.html|access-date=16 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With her role in ''Anastasia'', Bergman made a triumphant return to working for a Hollywood studio (albeit in a film produced in Europe) and won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for a second time. Cary Grant accepted the award on her behalf. Its director, [[Anatole Litvak]], described her as &quot;one of the greatest actresses in the world&quot;:{{quote|Ingrid looks better now than she ever did. She's 42, but she looks divine.

[[File:Grant Bergman Indiscreet Still.jpg|thumb|right|Grant and Bergman in ''Indiscreet'' (1958)]] 
After Anastasia, Bergman starred in [[Indiscreet (1958 film)|''Indiscreet'']] (1958), a romantic comedy directed by [[Stanley Donen]]. She plays a successful London stage actress, Anna Kalman, who falls in love with Philip Adams, a diplomat played by [[Cary Grant]]. The film is based on the play '''Kind Sir''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' written by Norman Krasna. Although unmarried, he tells her that he is married but cannot get a divorce. He does so, in order to remain single. [[Cecil Parker]] and [[Phyllis Calvert]] also co-starred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Viladas|first=Pilar|date=7 October 2001|title=The Joy of Sets (Published 2001)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/magazine/the-joy-of-sets.html|access-date=14 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman later starred in the 1958 picture ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'', based on a true story about Gladys Aylward, who was a Christian missionary in China. Despite many obstacles, she is able to win the hearts of the natives, through patience and sincerity. In the film's climatic scene, she leads a group of orphaned children to safety, to escape from the Japanese invasion. The ''New York Times''  wrote, &quot;the justification of her achievements is revealed by no other displays than those of Miss Bergman's mellow beauty, friendly manner and melting charm.&quot; The film also co-starred [[Robert Donat]] and [[Curd Jürgens|Curd Jurgens.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=14 December 1958|title=Screen: China Mission; 'Inn of 6th Happiness' at Paramount, Plaza (Published 1958)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/12/14/archives/screen-china-mission-inn-of-6th-happiness-at-paramount-plaza.html|access-date=14 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two stars mesh perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/17/archives/cactus-flower-blooms.html|title='Cactus Flower' Blooms|work=The New York Times|date=17 December 1969|first=Howard|last=Thompson|access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On 9 April 1970, [[Guy Green (filmmaker)|Guy Green]]'s ''[[A Walk in the Spring Rain]]'' had its world premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/23437-A-WALK-IN-THE-SPRING-RAIN?cxt=filmography|access-date=20 October 2020|website=catalog.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman played Libby, the middle-aged wife of a New York professor ([[Fritz Weaver]]). She accompanies him on his sabbatical in the Tennessee mountains, where he intends to write a book. She meets a local handyman, Will Cade ([[Anthony Quinn]]), and they form a mutual attraction. The screenplay was based on the romantic novel written by Rachel Maddux. ''The New York Times'' in its review wrote, &quot;Striving mightily and looking lovely, Miss Bergman seems merely a petulant woman who falls into the arms of Quinn for novelty, from boredom with her equally bored husband, [Weaver], pecking away on a book in their temporary mountain retreat.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=18 June 1970|title=Bergman and Quinn Are Stars Of 'A Walk in the Spring Rain' (Published 1970)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/18/archives/bergman-and-quinn-are-stars-of-a-walk-in-the-spring-rain.html|access-date=19 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 18 February 1971, ''Captain Brassbound's Conversion'', a play based on George Bernard Shaw's work, made a debut at London theatre. She took on the role of a woman whose husband has taken up with a woman half her age. Although the play was a commercial success, critics were not very receptive of Bergman's British accent.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

She made an appearance in one episode of The Bob Hope Show in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=TV.com|title=The Bob Hope Show: April 10, 1972|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-bob-hope-show/april-10-1972-1230878/|access-date=16 October 2020|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, U.S. Senator [[Charles H.

Percy noted that she had been &quot;the victim of bitter attack in this chamber 22 years ago.&quot; He expressed regret that the persecution caused Bergman to &quot;leave this country at the height of her career.&quot;  Bergman said that the remarks had been difficult to forget, and had caused her to avoid the country for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/29/archives/ingrid-bergman-gets-apology-for-senate-attack.html|title=Ingrid Bergman Gets Apology for Senate Attack|date=29 April 1972|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had paid a high price, Bergman had made peace with America, according to her daughter, Isabella Rossellini.&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot; /&gt;

Also that year, Bergman was the president of the jury at the 1973 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/perso/index.php?langue=6002&amp;personne=4296444 |title=Ingrid Bergman profile |work=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |access-date=23 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312222212/http://www.festival-cannes.fr/perso/index.php?langue=6002&amp;personne=4296444 |archive-date=12 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal|The Daytona Beach Sunday News]]'' in 1978, she recalled this event because she met with Ingmar Bergman once again. This gave her the opportunity to remind him about the letter she had written, some ten years ago, asking him to cast her in one of his pictures. Knowing that Ingmar would be attending, she made  a copy of his long-ago reply, and put it in his pocket. He didn't reply again, for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal - Google News Archive Search|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&amp;dat=19781008&amp;id=6YofAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1226,3674870|access-date=19 October 2020|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Next, Bergman returned to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and appeared with [[John Gielgud]] in ''[[The Constant Wife]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;'' which was a critical success. The theatre was consistently packed. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' found the play &quot;unusually entertaining,&quot; while Harold Hobson of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' was still peeved at Bergman for playing yet another English woman with a &quot;strange accent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; 

Bergman became one of the few actresses ever to receive three Oscars when she won her third (and first in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]) for her performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). Director [[Sidney Lumet]] had offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:
{{quote|She had chosen a very small part, and I couldn't persuade her to change her mind. ... Since her part was so small, I decided to film her one big scene, where she talks for almost five minutes, straight, all in one long take. A lot of actresses would have hesitated over that. She loved the idea, and made the most of it. She ran the gamut of emotions. I've never seen anything like it.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|246–247}}}}

At the 1975 Academy Awards, film director [[Jean Renoir]] was to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to the motion picture industry. As he was ill at the time, he asked that Ingrid Bergman accept this award on his behalf. Bergman made a speech of acceptance that praised his films and the &quot;compassion that marked all his works&quot; as well as his teaching of both young filmmakers and audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBMS&quot; /&gt; {{rp|542–543}} Although she had been nominated for the new Best Supporting Actress Award, she considered her role in ''Murder on the Orient Express'' to be quite minor and did not expect to win. When the award was announced, in her surprised and unrehearsed remarks, she remarked to the audience that [[Valentina Cortese]] should have won the award for her role &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky5sW4no_cg&amp;t=10s|title= Ingrid Bergman Wins Supporting Actress: 1975 Oscars}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;IBMS&quot;/&gt;in ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'', by [[François Truffaut|Truffaut]]. Bergman and Cortese spent the rest of the evening in each other's company, and were the subject of many photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBMS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/ingredbergmanmys00berg|title=Ingrid Bergman: My Story|first=Ingrid|last=Bergman|date=9 October 1987|publisher=[S.l.]: Dell |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|542–543}} Also in 1975, Bergman attended the AFI tribute to [[Orson Welles]]. The audience gave her a standing ovation when she appeared on stage. She joked that she hardly knew Welles and they only invited her because she was working across the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=2 March 1975|title=FILM VIEW (Published 1975)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/02/archives/film-view-the-undiminished-chutzpah-of-orson-welles.html|access-date=16 October 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Bergman was the first person to receive France's newly created [[Honorary César]], a national film award. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=César d'Honneur - César|url=http://www.allocine.fr/festivals/festival-128/palmares/prix-18350744/|publisher=Allo Cine|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in [[A Matter of Time (film)|''A Matter of Time'']], by [[Vincente Minnelli]], which premiered on 7 October 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/55847-A-MATTER-OF-TIME?cxt=filmography|access-date=20 October 2020|website=catalog.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert in his review wrote, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; is a fairly large disappointment as a movie, but as an occasion for reverie, it does very nicely. Once we've finally given up on the plot - a meandering and jumbled business - we're left with the opportunity to contemplate Ingrid Bergman at 60. And to contemplate Ingrid Bergman at any age is, I submit, a passable way to spend one's time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=A Matter of Time movie review (1976) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-matter-of-time-1976|access-date=21 October 2020|website=www.rogerebert.com/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1978, Bergman returned to the London's West with [[Wendy Hiller]] in ''[[Waters of the Moon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;'' She played Helen Lancaster, a rich, self-centered woman whose car becomes stuck in a snowdrift. The play became the great new hit of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1978, Bergman appeared in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (''Höstsonaten''), by accomplished Swedish filmmaker, [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation), for which she received her seventh—and final—Academy Award nomination. She did not attend the awards, due to her illness. This was her final cinema performance. The film gave her the opportunity to work with [[Liv Ullmann]], another well-known and respected Scandinavian artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leamer|first=Laurence|url=http://archive.org/details/astimegoesbylif00leam|title=As time goes by: The life of Ingrid Bergman|date=1986|publisher=New York: Harper &amp; Row|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-06-015485-1|pages=151–154, 165, 169, 174, 176, 178, 183, 187–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist, Charlotte, who travels to Norway intending to visit her neglected eldest daughter, Eva, played by Ullmann. Eva is married to a clergyman and they care for her sister, Helena, who is severely disabled, paralyzed, and unable to speak clearly. Charlotte has not visited either of her two daughters for seven years. Upon arrival at Eva's home, she is shocked and dismayed to learn that her younger daughter is also in residence, and not still in the institution &quot;home&quot;.

Bergman was battling cancer at the time of the filming. The final two weeks of the shooting schedule required adjustment, because she required additional surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt;{{rp|568–569}} Believing that her career was nearing its end, Bergman wanted her swan song to be honourable. She was pleased with the overwhelming critical acclaim for ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. [[Stanley Kaufmann]] of ''The New Republic'' wrote, &quot;The astonishment is Bergman's performance. We've all adored her for decades but not many of us have thought her a superb actress. Here, she exalted in the hands of a master.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, &quot;An expressive force we can't even remember seeing since Hollywood grabbed her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' (London) concurred that it was &quot;a tour-de-force, such as the cinema rarely sees.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Both Bergman and Ullmann won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film|''New York Film Critic's Award'']] and Italy's [[David di Donatello|''Donatello'']] award, for their roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bergman|first=Ingrid|title=My Story|isbn=0440032997|location=New York|publisher=Delacorte|year=1973|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman later recalled that Ingmar had possibly given her the best role of her career, that she would never make another movie again. &quot;I don't want to go down and play little parts. This should be the end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

In 1979, Bergman hosted the AFI's Life Achievement Award Ceremony for [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American Film Institute Salute to Alfred Hitchcock (TV)|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=cbs+television+w..&amp;p=30&amp;item=T82:0564|access-date=7 October 2020|website=paleycenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the program's finale, she presented him with the wine cellar key that was crucial to the plot of ''Notorious''. &quot;Cary Grant kept this for 10 years, then he gave it to me, and I kept it for 20 years for good luck and now I give it to you with my prayers,&quot; before adding &quot;God bless you, Hitch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=9 March 1979|title=Testimonial With a 'Hitch'|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/03/09/testimonial-with-a-hitch/04d85cab-fc87-4983-b68f-72e2af3f1a39/|access-date=16 October 2020|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman was the guest of honour in the Variety's Club All Star Salute program in December 1979.

In the late 70s, Bergman appeared on several talk shows, and was interviewed by Merv Griffin, David Frost, Michael Parkinson, Mike Douglas, John Russell and Dick Cavett, discussing her life and career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman|url=https://www.imdb.com/filmosearch?role=nm0000006&amp;job_type=self|access-date=16 October 2020|website=IMDb|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1980, Bergman's autobiography, ''Ingrid Bergman: My Story'', was written with the help of [[Alan Burgess]]. In it, she discusses her childhood, her early career, her life during her time in Hollywood, the Rossellini scandal, and subsequent events. The book was written after her children warned her that she would only be known through rumors and interviews if she did not tell her own story.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In 1982, she was awarded the [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello's]] Golden Medal of the Minister of Tourism, given by The Academy of Italian Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman|url=https://www.daviddidonatello.it/motore-di-ricerca/cercavincitori2.php?idsoggetto=61&amp;vin=Bergman|access-date=30 November 2020|website=daviddidonatello|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally that year, Bergman played the starring role in a television mini-series, ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982), about the late Israeli [[prime minister]] [[Golda Meir]]. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. Bergman was surprised to be offered the role, but the producer explained, &quot;People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people.&quot; Her daughter Isabella added, &quot;Now, ''that'' was interesting to Mother.&quot; She was also persuaded that Golda was a &quot;grand-scale person&quot;, one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role &quot;also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|293}}

According to Chandler, &quot;Ingrid's rapidly deteriorating health was a more serious problem. Insurance for Bergman was impossible. Not only did she have cancer, but it was spreading, and if anyone had known how bad it was, no one would have gone on with the project.&quot; After viewing the series on TV, Isabella commented:

{{quote|She never showed herself like that in life. In life, Mum showed courage. She was always a little vulnerable, courageous, but vulnerable. Mother had a sort of presence, like Golda, I was surprised to see it&amp;nbsp;... When I saw her performance, I saw a mother that I'd never seen before—this woman with balls.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|290}}}}

Her daughter said that Bergman identified with Golda Meir, because she, too had felt guilty. Bergman tried to strike a balance between home and work responsibilities and deal with &quot;the inability to be in two places at one time&quot;. Bergman's arm was terribly swollen from her cancer surgery. She was often ill during the filming, recovering from the mastectomy and the removal of lymph nodes. It was important to her, as an actress, to make a certain gesture of Meir's, which required her to raise both arms, but she was unable to properly raise one arm. During the night, her arm was propped up, in an uncomfortable position, so that the fluid would drain, and enable to perform her character's important gesture. &lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|295}} 

Despite her health problems, she rarely complained or let others see the difficulties she endured. Four months after the filming was completed, she died, on her 67th birthday. After her death, her daughter Pia accepted her Emmy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|296}}

==Personal life==

=== Marriages and children ===
[[File:Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, 1953.jpg|253x253px|thumb|Rossellini and Bergman in 1953, a scandal that rocked Hollywood]]
On 10 July 1937, at the age of 21, in [[Stöde]],&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot; /&gt; Bergman married a dentist, Petter Aron Lindström (1 March 1907 – 24 May 2000), who later became a neurosurgeon. The couple had one child, a daughter, [[Pia Lindström|Friedel Pia Lindström]] (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindström stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in ''Life'', the &quot;doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully&quot;. He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a &quot;professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood&quot;. Lindström later moved to San Francisco, California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeMag&quot; /&gt; Petter did not view Bergman as the rest of the world did. He thought she was too absorbed with her popularity and image, and was full of vanity. According to Bergman biographer, Donald Spoto, Petter managed her career and financial matters. He was very frugal with money.&lt;ref name=&quot;IT&quot; /&gt; Petter had been aware of his wife's affairs. When asked by the biographer why he didn't ask for a divorce, he replied bluntly, &quot;I lived with that because of her income&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IT&quot; /&gt; In 1945, she and Lindström, became United States citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot; /&gt; On 27 August, two days before her 30th birthday, as Ingrid Lindstrom, she and her husband both filed &quot;[[Declaration of Intention]]&quot; forms with the United States District Court, Southern District of California,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com/aleweb/ale/do/login|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=Ancestrylibrary.proquest.com|access-date=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to become US citizens.

Bergman returned to Europe after the scandalous publicity surrounding her affair with Italian director [[Roberto Rossellini]] during the filming of ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' in 1950. She begged Petter for a divorce and contact with Pia. She had asked him before but he refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=17 June 2000|title=Petter Lindstrom|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jun/17/2|access-date=20 October 2020|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month the film was released, she gave birth to a boy, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (&quot;Robin&quot;) Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bondanella&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}} A week after her son was born, according to the Mexican law, she divorced Lindström and married Rossellini by proxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; On 18 June 1952, she gave birth to the twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and [[Isabella Rossellini]]. Isabella became an actress and model, and Isotta Ingrid became a professor of [[Italian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ingrid Bergman-Rossellini, Daughter of Legendary Actress and Renowned Director, to Discuss Her Father's Films|url=https://www.ramapo.edu/news/press-releases/02_25_2004/|access-date=23 October 2020|website=News / Media|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1957 that Bergman was reunited with Pia, in Rome. Petter, however, remained bitter towards Bergman.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

0n 21 December 1958, Bergman married Lars Schmidt, a theatrical entrepreneur from a wealthy Swedish shipping family. She met Schmidt through her publicist, Kay Brown. They spent summers together in Danholmen, Lars's private island off the coast of Sweden. The couple and their children stayed at Choisel, not too far from Paris. With Bergman constantly off to filming, Lars was all over Europe, producing plays and television shows. Their work schedules put a strain on their marriage. While vacationing with Schmidt in Monte Gordo beach (Algarve region, Portugal) in 1963, right after recording the TV movie ''Hedda Gabler'', she got ticketed for wearing a bikini that showed too much according to the modesty standards of conservative Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogues.publico.pt/reporterasolta/o-bikini/|title=O bikini|website=Repórter à Solta|date=31 March 2010|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; After almost two decades of marriage, the couple divorced in 1975.

In October 1978, Bergman gave an interview, regarding what was to be her last film role. ''Autumn Sonata'' explored the relationship between a mother and daughter. She played a classical concert pianist, who valued her career more than motherhood, and caring for her two daughters. Bergman said that this role reminded her of the times when she had to &quot;leave&quot; her own daughters. She stated that &quot;A lot of it is what I have lived through, leaving my children, having a career.&quot; She recalled instances in her own life, &quot;when she had to pry her children's arms from around her neck, 'and then go away' to advance her career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Before her death in 1982, Bergman made a few alterations in her will. The bulk of her estate was divided among her four children. She left some provisions for Rossellini's niece, Fiorella, her maid in Rome, and her agent's daughter, Kate Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Grace May|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=SeeRDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT363&amp;lpg=PT363&amp;dq=ingrid+bergman+++robert+anderson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6QTOx4WYIC&amp;sig=ACfU3U0rOhEkOgJrhG2xXOc-tH6sL2F1kg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH_Ofgn4DtAhXulEsFHb0JC7w4HhDoATAFegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ingrid%20bergman%20+%20robert%20anderson&amp;f=false|title=Ingrid Bergman|date=2016-11-24|publisher=New Word City|isbn=978-1-61230-098-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

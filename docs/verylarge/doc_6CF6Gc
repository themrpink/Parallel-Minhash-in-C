==Examples==
There are many different kinds of laboratory glassware items:

Examples of glassware containers include:
* [[Beaker (glassware)|Beakers]] are simple cylindrical shaped containers used to hold [[reagent]]s or [[Sample (material)|samples]].
* [[Laboratory flask|Flasks]] are narrow-necked glass containers, typically conical or spherical, used in a laboratory to hold reagents or samples. Examples flasks include the [[Erlenmeyer flask]], [[Florence flask]], and [[Schlenk flask]].
* [[Bottle]]s are containers with narrow openings generally used to store reagents or samples. Small bottles are called [[vial]]s.
* [[Jar]]s are cylindrical containers with wide openings that may be sealed. [[Bell jar]]s are used to contain vacuums.
* [[Test tube]]s are used by [[chemist]]s to hold, mix, or heat small quantities of solid or liquid chemicals, especially for [[qualitative data|qualitative]] experiments and assays
* [[Desiccator]]s of glass construction are used to dry materials or keep material dry.
* [[Evaporating dish|Glass evaporating dishes]], such as [[watch glass]]es, are primarily used as an evaporating surface (though they may be used to cover a beaker.)
* Glass [[Petri dish]]es are used to culture living cells.
* [[Microscope slide]]s are thin strips used to hold items under a microscope.

Examples of glassware used for measurements include:
* [[Graduated cylinders]] are cylindrical containers used for volumetric measurements.
* [[Volumetric flask]]s are for measuring a specific volume of fluid.
* [[Burette]]s are used to disperse precise amounts of liquid reagents.
* Glass [[pipette]]s are used to transfer precise quantities of fluids.
* [[Ebulliometer|Glass Ebulliometers]] are used to accurately measure the boiling point of liquids.

Other examples of glassware includes:
* [[Stirring rod]]s are used to mix chemicals.
* [[Condenser (laboratory)|Condensers]] are used to cool hot liquids or vapors.
* [[Retort|Glass retorts]] are used for distillation.
* [[Abderhalden's drying pistol|Drying pistols]] are used to free samples from traces of water, or other impurities.

Clozapine is associated with a relatively high risk of [[agranulocytosis|low white blood cells]] (agranulocytosis), a condition of suppressed immunity which may result in death.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; To decrease this risk, it is recommended that the white blood cell count be regularly monitored.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Other serious risks include [[epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[myocarditis|inflammation of the heart]], [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar levels]], [[constipation]], and in older people with psychosis as a result of [[dementia]], an increased risk of death.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartling L, Abou-Setta AM, Dursun S, Mousavi SS, Pasichnyk D, Newton AS | title = Antipsychotics in adults with schizophrenia: comparative effectiveness of first-generation versus second-generation medications: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 498–511 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22893011 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-157-7-201210020-00525 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA2020&gt;{{cite web |title=Clozaril, Fazaclo ODT, Versacloz (clozapine): Drug Safety Communication - FDA Strengthens Warning That Untreated Constipation Can Lead to Serious Bowel Problems |url=https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/clozaril-fazaclo-odt-versacloz-clozapine-drug-safety-communication-fda-strengthens-warning-untreated |website=FDA |access-date=30 January 2020 |language=en |date=28 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common side effects include [[sedation|drowsiness]], increased saliva production, [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[blurred vision]], and [[dizziness]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; The potentially permanent movement disorder [[tardive dyskinesia]] occurs in about 5% of people.&lt;ref name=Hart2012/&gt; Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first and demonstrated very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than [[amisulpride]] (2nd), 33% more effective than [[olanzapine]] (3rd), and twice as effective as [[haloperidol]], [[quetiapine]], and [[aripiprazole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet2013&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!-- History, society and culture --&gt;
Clozapine was first made in 1956, and sold commercially in 1972.&lt;ref name=Stat2019&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haidary |first1=HA |last2=Padhy |first2=RK |title=Clozapine |date=January 2019 |pmid=30571020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cri2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crilly J | title = The history of clozapine and its emergence in the US market: a review and analysis | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17580753 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X07070335 | s2cid = 21086497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first atypical antipsychotic.&lt;ref name=Cor2013&gt;{{cite book| veditors = Li JJ, Corey JJ | chapter = Chapter 7: CNS Drugs |title=Drug discovery practices, processes, and perspectives |date=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=9781118354469 |page=248 | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mIyxO5cLEAcC&amp;pg=PA248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the safest and most effective medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO21st&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = ((World Health Organization)) | title = World Health Organization model list of essential medicines: 21st list 2019 | year = 2019 | hdl = 10665/325771 | author-link = World Health Organization | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva | id = WHO/MVP/EMP/IAU/2019.06. License: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available as a [[generic medication]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

==Medical uses==
Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug primarily used in people who are unresponsive to or intolerant to other antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Essali A, Al-Haj Haasan N, Li C, Rathbone J | title = Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD000059 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19160174 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000059.pub2 | pmc = 7065592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they have failed to respond satisfactorily to at least two different [[antipsychotic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meltzer HY | title = Treatment-resistant schizophrenia--the role of clozapine | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–20 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9524789 | doi = 10.1185/03007999709113338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown to be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia than [[typical antipsychotics]], with more pronounced effects in those who have responded poorly to other medication.&lt;ref name=Lancet2013/&gt; It may also be used for the treatment of psychosis secondary to [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name=BNF74&gt;{{cite book|title=British national formulary : BNF 74|date=2017|publisher=British Medical Association|isbn=978-0857112989|page=377|edition=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clozapine is usually given by mouth in tablet or liquid form,&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt; however an unlicensed short-acting [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular injectable]] formulation is available. It is not a depot injection, and instead has a similar duration of action as clozapine by mouth. The injectable formulation may be used in highly agitated people with schizophrenia who consistently refuse clozapine by mouth, but are predicted to respond well to clozapine therapy, with the injection being administered with the intention of transitioning the person to oral clozapine.&lt;ref name=Sus2019 /&gt; The injectable form is reportedly difficult to use due to painful administration, higher doses requiring injection into multiple sites simultaneously, and even more stringent monitoring than oral clozapine (with the additional difficulty of withdrawing blood samples for testing from agitated individuals).&lt;ref name=Sus2019 /&gt;

The effect of clozapine, however, is not (at least in the short term) reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The relapse rate is lower and patient acceptability is better.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence clozapine may reduce propensity for substance abuse in schizophrenic patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee M, Dickson RA, Campbell M, Oliphant J, Gretton H, Dalby JT |title = Clozapine and substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia |journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume = 43 |pages = 855–856 |year = 1998 |issue = 8 |pmid = 9806095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be better than other antipsychotics in people with both [[schizophrenia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=146 |title=How would you treat someone who has both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease? |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211053108/http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=146 |archive-date=2013-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Clozapine may cause side effects, some of which are serious and potentially fatal. Common side effects include [[constipation]], bed-wetting, night-time [[drooling]], [[muscle stiffness]], [[sedation]], [[tremor]]s, [[orthostatic hypotension]], hyperglycemia, and [[weight gain]]. The risk of developing [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], such as [[tardive dyskinesia]] is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril |title=Clozapine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110214051/https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril |archive-date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clozapine carries five black [[Boxed warning|box warnings]], including warnings for [[agranulocytosis]], [[central nervous system depression]], [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]], seizure disorder, [[bone marrow suppression]], dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, [[orthostatic hypotension]] (with or without [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]]) and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Monograph/monograph.aspx?cpnum=142&amp;sec=monadve|title=Clinical Pharmacology|website=www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowering of the [[seizure threshold]] may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCQ&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril|title=Clozapine|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110214051/https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril|archive-date=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many males have experienced cessation of [[ejaculation]] during [[orgasm]] as a side effect of clozapine, though this is not documented in official drug guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggaley M | title = Sexual dysfunction in schizophrenia: focus on recent evidence | journal = Human Psychopharmacology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–209 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18338766 | doi = 10.1002/hup.924 | s2cid = 30468671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many side-effects can be managed and may not warrant discontinuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen J, Correll CU, Manu P, Kane JM | title = Termination of clozapine treatment due to medical reasons: when is it warranted and how can it be avoided? | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 603–13 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23842012 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.12r08064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agranulocytosis===
{{main|Agranulocytosis}}
Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count). Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% of people who take clozapine during the first few months of treatment;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodmanGilman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Baldessarini |first=Ross J. |author2=Frank I.

Rapid [[point-of-care tests]] may simplify the monitoring for agranulocytosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid31692521&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalaria SN, Kelly DL |title=Development of point-of-care testing devices to improve clozapine prescribing habits and patient outcomes |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat |volume=15 |pages=2365–2370 |date=2019 |pmid=31692521 |pmc=6708436 |doi=10.2147/NDT.S216803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early findings suggest that the concurrent use of [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (GCSF) to maintain the neutrophil count whilst on rechallenge following neutropenia, is safe and effective. But, if agranulocytosis was later to occur there would be little if any therapeutic alternative which would ordinarily be GCSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myles&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Myles N, Myles H, Clark SR, Bird R, Siskind D |title=Use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to prevent recurrent clozapine-induced neutropenia on drug rechallenge: A systematic review of the literature and clinical recommendations |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=10 |pages=980–989 |date=October 2017|pmid=28747065 |doi=10.1177/0004867417720516|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LallyJ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lally J, Malik S, Krivoy A et al.|s2cid=41269943 |title=The Use of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor in Clozapine Rechallenge: A Systematic Review |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=600–604 |date=October 2017 |pmid=28817489 |doi=10.1097/JCP.0000000000000767|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-use-of-granulocyte-colonystimulating-factor-in-clozapine-rechallenge(ca7cfadf-aa22-4c06-ae6d-a8fcce079c12).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiac toxicity===
Myocarditis is a sometimes fatal side effect of clozapine, which usually develops within the first month of commencement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haas SJ, Hill R, Krum H, Liew D, Tonkin A, Demos L, Stephan K, McNeil J | title = Clozapine-associated myocarditis: a review of 116 cases of suspected myocarditis associated with the use of clozapine in Australia during 1993–2003 | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–57 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17194170 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200730010-00005 | s2cid = 1153693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, [[troponin]], occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ronaldson KJ, Fitzgerald PB, Taylor AJ, Topliss DJ, McNeil JJ | title = A new monitoring protocol for clozapine-induced myocarditis based on an analysis of 75 cases and 94 controls | journal = The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 458–465 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21524186 | doi = 10.3109/00048674.2011.572852 | s2cid = 26627093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of [[heart failure]] are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin.

===Gastrointestinal hypomotility===
Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe [[constipation]], [[fecal impaction]], paralytic [[ileus]], [[bowel obstruction]], acute megacolon, [[ischemia]] or [[necrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer SE, McLean RM, Ellis PM, Harrison-Woolrych M | title = Life-threatening clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility: an analysis of 102 cases | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–768 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18452342 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v69n0509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonic hypomotility has been shown to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] function is measured objectively using [[radiopaque]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Nowitz M, Stanley J, Grant E, Huthwaite M, Dunn H, Ellis, PM | title = Clozapine-treated patients have marked gastrointestinal hypomotility, the probable basis of life-threatening gastrointestinal complications: a cross sectional study | journal = EBioMedicine | volume = 5 | pages = 125–134 | date = March 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.020 | pmid = 27077119 | pmc = 4816835 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen D, Bogers JP, van Dijk D, Bakker B, Schulte PF | title = Beyond white blood cell monitoring: screening in the initial phase of clozapine therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 1307–1312 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23140648 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.11r06977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other [[antipsychotic]] medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Newton-Howes G, Clarke MJ | title = Pharmacological treatment for antipsychotic | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD011128 | date = 24 January 2017 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011128.pub2| pmid = 28116777 | pmc = 6465073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of [[laxative]]s for all clozapine-treated people has been shown to improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Ellis PM, Nowitz M, Stanley J, Grant E, Huthwaite M, Dunn H | title = The Porirua Protocol in the treatment of clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility and constipation: A pre- and post-treatment study | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 31 | issue = 1 |pages = 75–85 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27826741| doi = 10.1007/s40263-016-0391-y | s2cid = 46825178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypersalivation===
Hypersalivation, or the excessive production of saliva, is one of the most common side effects of clozapine (30-80%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Syed Cochrane 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Syed |first1=R |last2=Au |first2=K |last3=Cahill |first3=C |last4=Duggan |first4=L |last5=He |first5=Y |last6=Udu |first6=V |last7=Xia |first7=J |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Syed |title=Pharmacological interventions for clozapine-induced hypersalivation. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=16 July 2008 |issue=3 |pages=CD005579 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005579.pub2 |pmid=18646130 |pmc=4160791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saliva production is especially bothersome at night and first thing in the morning, as the immobility of sleep precludes the normal clearance of saliva by swallowing that occurs throughout the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syed Cochrane 2008&quot; /&gt; While clozapine is a [[muscarinic]] antagonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M1]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M2]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M3]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5|M5]] receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4|M4]] subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the [[salivary gland]], its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for hypersalivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409612_2 |title=Treatment of Clozapine-Induced Sialorrhea |access-date=2010-02-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209042338/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409612_2 |archive-date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clozapine-induced hypersalivation is likely a dose-related phenomenon, and tends to be worse when first starting the medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syed Cochrane 2008&quot; /&gt; Besides decreasing the dose or slowing the initial dose titration, other interventions that have shown some benefit include systemically-absorbed anticholinergic medications like [[diphenhydramine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Syed Cochrane 2008&quot; /&gt; and topical anticholinergic medications like [[ipratropium bromide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird et al 2011 Review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bird |first1=Angela M |last2=Smith |first2=Tawny L |last3=Walton |first3=Amy E |title=Current Treatment Strategies for Clozapine-Induced Sialorrhea |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |date=3 May 2011 |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=667–675 |doi=10.1345/aph.1P761|pmid=21540404 |s2cid=42222976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mild hypersalivation may be managed by sleeping with a towel over the pillow at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird et al 2011 Review&quot; /&gt;

===Central nervous system===
CNS side effects include [[drowsiness]], [[vertigo]], [[headache]], [[tremor]], [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[sleep disturbances]], [[nightmares]], restlessness, [[akinesia]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[seizures]], [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], [[akathisia]], [[confusion]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[hyperkinesia]], [[weakness]], [[lethargy]], [[ataxia]], [[slurred speech]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[myoclonic jerks]], and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]].

Similar to other [[antipsychotics]] clozapine rarely has been known to cause [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/notfoundstatic.asp?refurl=/cgi/generic/clozapine_ad.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104074526/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/clozapine_ad.htm|url-status=dead|title=RxList Page Not Found|archive-date=4 November 2007|website=RxList|access-date=4 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urinary incontinence===
Clozapine is linked to [[urinary incontinence]],&lt;ref name = Raja&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raja M | title = Clozapine safety, 35 years later | journal = Current Drug Safety | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 164–184 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 22122392 | doi = 10.2174/157488611797579230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though its appearance may be under-recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnes TR, Drake MJ, Paton C | title = Nocturnal enuresis with antipsychotic medication | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 200 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22215862 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.111.095737 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal effects===
Abrupt withdrawal may lead to [[cholinergic]] [[rebound effects]], severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers be made aware of the symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed-1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmed S, Chengappa KN, Naidu VR, Baker RW, Parepally H, Schooler NR | title = Clozapine withdrawal-emergent dystonias and dyskinesias: a case series | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 9 | pages = 472–7 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9771818 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v59n0906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Szafrański-&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szafrański T, Gmurkowski K | title = [Clozapine withdrawal.

===Weight gain and diabetes===
In addition to [[hyperglycemia]], significant [[weight gain]] is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirshing DA, Wirshing WC, Kysar L, Berisford MA, Goldstein D, Pashdag J, Mintz J, Marder SR | title = Novel antipsychotics: comparison of weight gain liabilities | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 358–63 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10401912 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v60n0602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired glucose metabolism and [[obesity]] have been shown to be constituents of the [[metabolic syndrome]] and may increase the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].

== Overdose ==
{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}
Fatalities have been reported due to clozapine overdose, though overdoses &gt; 4000&amp;nbsp;mg have been survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keck et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keck |first1=PE Jr. |last2=McElroy |first2=SL |title=Clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antimanic and mood-stabilizing medications |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |date=2002 |volume=63 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=3–11 |pmid=11913673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug interactions ==
[[Fluvoxamine]] inhibits the metabolism of clozapine leading to significantly increased blood levels of clozapine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sproule BA, Naranjo CA, Brenmer KE, Hassan PC | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and CNS drug interactions.

When [[carbamazepine]] is concurrently used with clozapine, it has been shown to decrease plasma levels of clozapine significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of clozapine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiihonen J, Vartiainen H, Hakola P | title = Carbamazepine-induced changes in plasma levels of neuroleptics | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–8 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7746842 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-979584 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Besag FM, Berry D | title = Interactions between antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–118 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16454538 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200629020-00001 | s2cid = 45735414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients should be monitored for &quot;decreased therapeutic effects of clozapine if carbamazepine&quot; is started or increased. If carbamazepine is discontinued or the dose of [[carbamazepine]] is decreased, therapeutic effects of clozapine should be monitored. The study recommends [[carbamazepine]] to not be used concurrently with clozapine due to increased risk of [[agranulocytosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jerling M, Lindström L, Bondesson U, Bertilsson L | title = Fluvoxamine inhibition and carbamazepine induction of the metabolism of clozapine: evidence from a therapeutic drug monitoring service | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 368–74 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 7974626 | doi = 10.1097/00007691-199408000-00006 | s2cid = 31325882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published case reports have stated that the use of [[benzodiazepines]] and clozapine concomitantly can result in severe adverse reaction such as respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest and sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bitter R, Demler TL, Opler L | title = Safety evaluation of the concomitant use of clozapine and benzodiazepines: a retrospective, cross-sectional chart review | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 265–70 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18832957 | doi = 10.1097/01.pra.0000336753.11943.7c | s2cid = 44550417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ciprofloxacin]] is an inhibitor of [[CYP1A2]] and clozapine is a major CYP1A2 substrate. Randomized study reported elevation in clozapine concentration in schizophrenia subjects concurrently taking [[ciprofloxacin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raaska K, Neuvonen PJ | title = Ciprofloxacin increases serum clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine: a study in patients with schizophrenia | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 585–9 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11151749 | doi = 10.1007/s002280000192 | s2cid = 20390680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the prescribing information for clozapine recommends &quot;reducing the dose of clozapine by one-third of original dose&quot; when [[ciprofloxacin]] and other [[CYP1A2]] inhibitors are added to therapy, but once [[ciprofloxacin]] is removed from therapy, it is recommended to return clozapine to original dose.&lt;ref&gt;Prescribing information.

Clozapine is classified as an [[atypical antipsychotic]] drug because it binds to [[serotonin]] as well as [[dopamine]] receptors.&lt;ref name =&quot;Nahgre01&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naheed M, Green B | title = Focus on clozapine | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11900316 | doi = 10.1185/0300799039117069 | s2cid = 13021800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clozapine is an antagonist at the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of the serotonin receptor, putatively improving depression, anxiety, and the negative cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = CNS Receptor Partial Agonists: A New Approach to Drug Discovery | author = Robinson DS | journal = Primary Psychiatry | year = 2007 | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 22–24 | url = http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1149 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118091113/http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1149 | archive-date = 18 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=clozapine {{!}} C18H19ClN4 – PubChem|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2818|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=16 July 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110428/http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2818|archive-date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clozapine induces the release of glutamate and [[Serine|D-serine]], an agonist at the glycine site of the [[NMDA receptor]], from [[astrocyte]]s,&lt;ref name=TAS&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanahashi S, Yamamura S, Nakagawa M, Motomura E, Okada M | title = Clozapine, but not haloperidol, enhances glial D-serine and L-glutamate release in rat frontal cortex and primary cultured astrocytes | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 165 | issue = 5 | pages = 1543–55 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21880034 | pmc = 3372736 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01638.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SLC1A2|reduces the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters]].

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Desmethylclozapine.svg|thumb|150px|left|''N''-[[desmethylclozapine]] (norclozapine), clozapine's major active metabolite.]]

The absorption of clozapine is almost complete following oral administration, but the oral [[bioavailability]] is only 60 to 70% due to [[first-pass metabolism]]. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food does not appear to affect the bioavailability of clozapine. However, it was shown that co-administration of food decreases the rate of absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=DiSanto|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Golden|first2=Gil|date=2009-08-01|title=Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablet 12.5 mg|journal=Clinical Drug Investigation|language=en|volume=29|issue=8|pages=539–549|doi=10.2165/00044011-200929080-00004|pmid=19591515|s2cid=45731786|issn=1179-1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[elimination half-life]] of clozapine is about 14 hours at [[steady state]] conditions (varying with daily dose).

Clozapine is extensively metabolized in the liver, via the [[cytochrome P450]] system, to [[Chemical polarity|polar]] metabolites suitable for elimination in the urine and feces. The major metabolite, ''norclozapine'' ([[demethylation|desmethyl]]-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 [[isoenzyme]] [[CYP1A2|1A2]] is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, [[CYP2D6|2D6]], [[CYP2E1|2E1]] and [[CYP3A4|3A3/4]] appear to play roles as well. Agents that [[enzyme induction and inhibition|induce]] (e.g., cigarette smoke) or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] (e.g., [[theophylline]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[fluvoxamine]]) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rostami-Hodjegan A, Amin AM, Spencer EP, Lennard MS, Tucker GT, Flanagan RJ | title = Influence of dose, cigarette smoking, age, sex, and metabolic activity on plasma clozapine concentrations: a predictive model and nomograms to aid clozapine dose adjustment and to assess compliance in individual patients | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–8 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14709950 | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000106221.36344.4d | s2cid = 31923731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeanne-albret-navarre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeanne III of Navarre|Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre]], by [[François Clouet]], 1570. She wrote to her son, Henry, in 1572: &quot;All she [Catherine] does is mock me, and afterwards tells others exactly the opposite of what I have said&amp;nbsp;... she denies everything, laughing in my face&amp;nbsp;... she treats me so shamefully that the patience I manage to maintain surpasses that of [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 149.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Huguenots retreated to the fortified stronghold of [[La Rochelle]] on the west coast, where Jeanne d'Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Bourbon]], joined them.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We have come to the determination to die, all of us&quot;, Jeanne wrote to Catherine, &quot;rather than abandon our God, and our religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, &quot;the most shameless woman in the world&quot;. Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], Jeanne's son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: &quot;Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard,&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne d'Albret wrote to her son, Henry: &quot;I am not free to talk with either the King or Madame, only the Queen Mother, who goads me [''me traite á la fourche'']&amp;nbsp;... You have doubtless realized that their main object, my son, is to separate you from God, and from me.&quot; Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151. An autopsy revealed tuberculosis and an abscess.&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], Paris.

====St. Bartholomew's Day massacre====
Three days later, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Massacre of St Bartholomew'', 313.&lt;/ref&gt; A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 83. The investigators traced the house and horse to the Guises and claimed to have found evidence that the would-be killer was [[Charles de Louviers de Maurevert]].&lt;/ref&gt; Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154–57. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;• The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].&lt;br /&gt;• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, 159–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettegree, 154&quot;/&gt; There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, &quot;Then kill them all! Kill them all!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 84.&lt;br /&gt;• The memoirs of [[Gaspard de Saulx|Marshal Tavannes]], edited by his son and published around 1620 (Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 122, 158), state that Catherine had summoned a war council in the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries Gardens]] (so as not to be overheard) to plan the next move: &quot;Because the attempt on the Admiral would cause a war, she, and the rest of us, agreed that it would be advisable to bring battle in Paris&quot;. It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order &quot;Kill them all!&quot;, he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], &quot;St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Morris, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163–64; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60–61. The [[misogyny]] and anti-Italianism in Huguenot &quot;histories&quot; proved seductive not only to Protestants but to Catholics seeking a [[scapegoat]] for France's woes.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]], by [[Jean de Court]], c. 1573. As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]

===Reign of Henry III===
Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were &quot;oh, my mother&amp;nbsp;...&quot; The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1569–1795|king]] the year before. However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: &quot;I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&amp;nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, &quot;it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&amp;nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.&quot; As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alençon]], known as &quot;Monsieur&quot;, played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 105–6; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine wrote, the next day: &quot;I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under [[Salic law]], by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettegree, 154&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Nicholas Hilliard 002.jpg|thumb|upright|Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alençon]], by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], c. 1577. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth of England]] called him &quot;her frog&quot; but found him &quot;not so deformed&quot; as she had been led to expect.]]

Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Bellièvre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough &quot;to put food on her table&quot;. Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Château d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.

Catherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209.&lt;/ref&gt; On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: &quot;She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.&lt;/ref&gt; She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, &quot;You are on the eve of a general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic League====
[[File:Guise.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry, Duke of Guise]], by Pierre Dumoûtier. Disarmed by Catherine's sweetness on meeting her for negotiations at [[Épernay]] in 1585, Guise tearfully insisted that his motives had been misunderstood. Catherine told him it would be better if he took off his boots and ate something, after which they could talk at length.]]

Many leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine's attempts to appease the Huguenots. After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the &quot;heretics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.&lt;/ref&gt; As Catherine put it, &quot;peace is carried on a stick&quot; (''bâton porte paix'').&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Take care&quot;, she wrote to the king, &quot;especially about your person. There is so much treachery about that I die of fear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was unable to fight the Catholics and the Protestants at once, both of whom had stronger armies than his own. In the [[Treaty of Nemours]], signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 440.&lt;/ref&gt; He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as &quot;[[The forty-five guards|the Forty-five]]&quot;, and left Catherine to sort out the mess.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack. The Spanish ambassador told Philip II that the abscess was about to burst.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1587, the Catholic backlash against the Protestants had become a campaign across Europe. [[Elizabeth I of England]]'s execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], on 8 February 1587 outraged the Catholic world.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip II of Spain]] prepared for an invasion of England. The League took control of much of northern France to secure French ports for his [[Spanish Armada|armada]].

====Last months and death====
[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8758 catherina de medices.tif|right|thumb|Engraving of Catherine de' Medici]]

Henry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Day of the Barricades|The Day of the Barricades]]&quot;, as the revolt became known, &quot;reduced the authority and prestige of the monarchy to its lowest ebb for a century and a half.&quot; Morris, 260.&lt;/ref&gt; When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, &quot;Never have I seen myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.

On 8 September 1588 at Blois, where the court had assembled for a meeting of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning. Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Henry wrote a note to Villeroy, which began: &quot;Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me.&quot; Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 300–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.

At the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 264–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a solution to his problems.(And yet the Mistress of the Duke of Guise who persuaded him to call on the King was of Catherine's entourage/clique making it highly unlikely Catherine was 'in the dark')  On 22 December 1588, Guise spent the night with his current mistress Charlotte de Sauve, the most accomplished and notorious member of Catherine de' Medici's group of female spies known as the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel le Roy Ladurie France 1460-1610&lt;/ref&gt;   On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the [[Château de Blois]]. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, &quot;Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 266. The words were reported to the government of Florence by Catherine's doctor, Filippo Cavriana, who acted as their informant.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, &quot;Oh, wretched man! What has he done?&amp;nbsp;... Pray for him&amp;nbsp;... I see him rushing towards his ruin.&quot;&lt;ref name = K267&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 267.&lt;/ref&gt; She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, &quot;Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery.&quot;&lt;ref name = K267/&gt; She left in tears.

[[File:Catherine de Medicis Henri II gisants basilique-Saint-Denis.jpg|thumb|[[Effigy|Effigie]]s of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II by [[Germain Pilon]] (1583), [[Basilica of St Denis]]]]
On 5 January 1589, Catherine died at the age of sixty-nine, probably from [[pleurisy]]. L'Estoile wrote: &quot;those close to her believed that her life had been shortened by displeasure over her son's deed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 268–69.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that she had no sooner died than she was treated with as much consideration as a dead goat. Because Paris was held by enemies of the crown, Catherine had to be buried provisionally at Blois. Eight months later, [[Jacques Clément]] stabbed Henry III to death. At the time, Henry was besieging Paris with the King of Navarre, who would [[Henry IV of France's succession|succeed him as Henry IV of France]]. Henry III's assassination ended nearly three centuries of [[House of Valois|Valois]] rule and brought the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon dynasty]] into power. Years later, [[Diane de France|Diane]], daughter of Henry II and Philippa Duci, had Catherine's remains reinterred in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis basilica]] in Paris. In 1793, a revolutionary mob tossed her bones into a mass grave with those of the other kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry IV was later reported to have said of Catherine:

{{quote|text=I ask you, what could a woman do, left by the death of her husband with five little children on her arms, and two families of France who were thinking of grasping the crown—our own [the Bourbons] and the Guises? Was she not compelled to play strange parts to deceive first one and then the other, in order to guard, as she did, her sons, who successively reigned through the wise conduct of that shrewd woman? I am surprised that she never did worse.&lt;ref&gt;Brantôme, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Patron of the arts==
{{Main|Catherine de' Medici's patronage of the arts| Catherine de' Medici's building projects| Catherine de' Medici's court festivals}}
[[File:Caron-Antoine-triumph-of-winter.jpg|thumb|350px|left|''Triumph of Winter'', by [[Antoine Caron]], c. 1568]]
Catherine believed in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]], who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her [[Medici]] ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late [[French Renaissance]] culture in all branches of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inventory]] drawn up at the [[Hôtel de la Reine]] after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector. Listed works of art included [[tapestry|tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china, and [[Limoges]] pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 240–41.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480–1541) and his son [[François Clouet]] ({{circa|1510}}{{snd}}1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt; After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 308–19; Jollet, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.&lt;ref name=&quot;biic&quot;/&gt; In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: [[Jean Cousin the Younger]] ({{circa|lk=no|1522|1594}}), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] ({{circa|lk=no|1521}}{{snd}}1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]]. Caron's vivid [[Mannerism]], with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt calls Caron's style &quot;perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society.&quot; Blunt, 98, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|festivities]] for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''fêtes,'' picnics, and mock battles of the &quot;magnificent&quot; entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].&lt;ref name = &quot;biic&quot;&gt;Blunt, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|200px|upright|The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]],'' from a 1582 engraving by Jacques Patin]]
The musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her &quot;a great creative artist in festivals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]],'' emerged from these creative advances.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. &quot;As the daughter of the Medici,&quot; suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, &quot;she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These included work on châteaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the Hôtel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504–1570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528–1590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument &quot;the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;zccclxxvix&quot;&gt;Zerner, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.

=== Culinary legend ===
The legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Ketcham Wheaton]] and [[Stephen Mennell]] provided the definitive arguments against these claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheaton2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ketcham Wheaton|title=Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTzZT_3DQTcC|date=18 January 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-4373-5|pages=43–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mennell1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Mennell|title=All Manners of Food: Eating and Taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdRnNPb8z3sC|edition=2nd|year=1996|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06490-6|pages=65–66; 69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that Catherine's father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy's most élite tables during the king's Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]]'s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de' Medici's father to her French-born mother; and that she had little influence at court until her husband's death because he was so besotted by his mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]]. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Campanini, &quot;The Illusive Story Of Catherine de' Medici: A Gastronomic Myth&quot;, ''The New Gastronome'' [https://thenewgastronome.com/caterina-de-medici-a-gastronomic-myth/], summarizing Antonella Campanini, Loïc Bienassis, &quot;La reine à la fourchette et autres histoires.

The earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for &quot;cuisine&quot; in [[Diderot]] and [[d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via &quot;that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de' Medici.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheaton2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=le Rond d'Alembert|first2=Jean|title=Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|date=1754|publisher=Briasson, David, Le Breton and Durand|location=Paris|page=vol.

==Links to the occult==
Catherine de' Medici has been labelled a &quot;sinister Queen… noted for her interest in the [[occult]] arts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Meaning of Witchcraft|last = Gardner|first = Gerald B.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; To some, Catherine and Henry's inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of [[witchcraft]]. Labouvie suggested that women's power was believed to be the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = See Rowlands|first = Alison|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as 'unnatural' and a small step from supernatural. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] was treated with similar suspicion—she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, [[John Dee]]), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s penile deformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The &quot;infertility&quot; of Catherine de Medici and its influence on 16th century France|last = Gordetsky, Rabinowitz and O'Brien|volume = 16|issue = 2|journal = The Canadian Journal of Urology|year = 2009|pages = 4584–8|url = https://www.canjurol.com/pdfs/DrGordetsky.pdf|pmid = 19364432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catherine de Medici's alleged talisman.jpg|thumb|The talisman Nostradamus allegedly made for Catherine de' Medici|276x276px]]
Suspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court—for example, the reputed seer [[Nostradamus]], who was rumoured to have created a [[talisman]] for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in [[necromancy]] and the black arts. [[Cosimo Ruggeri]], in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own &quot;trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts&quot;, although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft prosecutions in Italy|last = Herzig|first = Tamar|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Levack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = Wiesner-Hanks|first = Merry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 253}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.

Catherine herself had been educated in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]]. It has been suggested that Catherine educated her son, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], in the dark arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Meaning of Witchcraft|last = Gardner|first = Gerald|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;the two devoted themselves to sorceries that were scandals of the age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft, Magic &amp; Alchemy|last = de Givry|first = Grillot|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some (more extreme) authors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Where Were You Before The Tree of Life? Volume 6|last = Farley|first = Peter R.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe Catherine to be the creator of the [[Black Mass]], a Satanic inversion of the traditional Catholic [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], although there is little to prove this aside from [[Jean Bodin]]'s account in his book ''De la démonomanie des sorciers''. Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her &quot;the Italian woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2010/06/history%E2%80%99s-black-widow-the-legend-of-catherine-de-medici.html|title = History's Black Widow: The Legend of Catherine de Medici|access-date = 20 February 2016|website = Wonders and Marvels|last = Gortner|first = C.

==Legacy and posthumous publications==
After Ellison's death, more manuscripts were discovered in his home, resulting in the publication of ''Flying Home and Other Stories'' in 1996. In 1999, his second novel, ''[[Juneteenth (novel)|Juneteenth]]'', was published under the editorship of [[John F. Callahan]], a professor at [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] and Ellison's [[literary executor]]. It was a 368-page condensation of more than 2,000 pages written by Ellison over a period of 40 years. All the manuscripts of this incomplete novel were published collectively on January 26, 2010, by [[Modern Library]], under the title ''[[Three Days Before the Shooting...]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Three Days Before The Shooting...''|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781588360892|publisher=Random House|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2014, the [[USPS]] issued a 91¢ stamp honoring Ralph Ellison in its Literary Arts series.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|year=2014|title=2014 USPS New Issues Calendar|url=http://www.stampnewsnow.com/uspsnewissues2014.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=18 February 2014|work=Ralph Ellison 91¢ Three Ounce Rate|publisher=Stamp News Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=21 April 2014|title=Scott new Issues Update|journal=Linn's Stamp News|publisher=Amos Press, Inc.|location=Sidney, Ohio|volume=87|issue=4460|pages=60–61|issn=0161-6234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A park on 150th Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] in Harlem (near 730 Riverside Drive, Ellison's principal residence from the early 1950s until his death) was dedicated to Ellison on May 1, 2003. In the park stands a 15 by 8-foot bronze slab with a &quot;cut-out man figure&quot; inspired by his book ''Invisible Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/northernriversidepark/monuments/1946|title=Riverside Park Monuments - Ralph Ellison Memorial : NYC Parks|website=nycgovparks.org|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Nathaniel Wright''' (September 4, 1908&amp;nbsp;– November 28, 1960) was an American author of novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction. Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, who suffered discrimination and violence in the South and the North. Literary critics believe his work helped change [[race relations in the United States]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wald, [http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2031 &quot;On Richard Wright's Centennial: The Great Outsider&quot;], Solidarity.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Richard Wright historical marker, Natchez, MS IMG 6941.JPG|thumb|A historic marker in [[Natchez, Mississippi]], commemorating Richard Wright, who was born near the city]]

=== Childhood in the South ===
Richard Wright's memoir, ''Black Boy,'' covers the interval in his life from 1912 until May 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wright|first=Richard|url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyrecordof00wrig_0|title=Black Boy|publisher=[[Harper and Row Publishers]]|year=1966|isbn=0-06-083056-5|location=New York|authorlink=|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908 at Rucker's Plantation, between the train town of [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] and the larger river city of [[Natchez, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;life&quot; /&gt; He was the son of Nathan Wright (c. 1880–c. 1940) who was a [[sharecropper]]&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/richard-wright/|title=Richard Wright|website=Mississippi Encyclopedia|access-date=October 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ella (Wilson) (b. 1884 Mississippi&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3AElla%20%2Bsurname%3AWilson%20%2Bbirth_place%3AMississippi%20%2Bresidence_year%3A1880-1910~%20%2Bfather_surname%3AWilson&amp;offset=20 US Census 1900]&lt;/ref&gt; – d.

Each of his grandfathers had taken part in the U.S. Civil War and gained freedom through service: his paternal grandfather Nathan Wright (1842–1904) had served in the 28th [[United States Colored Troops]]; his maternal grandfather Richard Wilson (1847–1921) escaped from slavery in the South to serve in the [[US Navy]] as a [[Landsman (rank)|Landsman]] in April 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://civilwartalk.com/threads/richard-wilson-aka-richard-vincent.97026/#post-832592 Summary of Richard Wilson and Nathan Wrights Civil War services at Civil War Talk Forum accessed May 5,2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard's father left the family when Richard was six years old, and he did not see Richard for 25 years. In 1911 or 1912 Ella moved to [[Natchez, Mississippi]] to be with her parents. While living in his grandparents' home he accidentally set the house on fire. Wright's mother was so mad that she beat him until he was unconscious.&lt;ref name=childhood&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/mississippi-writers/richard-wright|title=Richard Wright|website=Mississippi Writers &amp; Musicians|access-date=October 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blackhistorynow.com/richard-wright/|title=Richard Wright|website=BlackHistoryNow|access-date=October 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 Ella put her sons in Settlement House, a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[orphanage]], for a short time.&lt;ref name=childhood/&gt;&lt;ref name=abuse&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blackboy.pbworks.com/w/page/59555846/Say%20Hello%20To%20Richard%20Wright|title=The Entire Life Story of Richard Wright in Context|website=PBworks|access-date=October 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was enrolled at [[Howe Institute]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from 1915 to 1916.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;  In 1916 his mother moved with Richard and his younger brother to live with her sister Maggie (Wilson) and Maggie's husband Silas Hoskins (born 1882) in [[Elaine, Arkansas]]. This part of Arkansas was in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where former cotton plantations had been. The Wrights were forced to flee after Silas Hoskins &quot;disappeared,&quot; reportedly  killed by a white man who coveted his successful saloon business.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3755|title=Richard Nathaniel Wright (1908–1960) – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother became incapacitated by a stroke, Richard was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle Clark Wilson and aunt Jodie in Greenwood, Mississippi.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; At the age of 12, he had not yet had a single complete year of schooling. Soon Richard with his younger brother and  mother returned to the home of his maternal grandmother, which was now in the state capital, [[Jackson, Mississippi]], where he lived from early 1920 until late 1925. His grandparents, still mad at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother.&lt;ref name=fire/&gt; But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref name=childhood/&gt; After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 135–138 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his grandparents' [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray so he may build a relationship with [[God]]. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother's home when she would not allow him to work on the [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Adventist Sabbath]], Saturday. His aunt's and grandparents' overbearing attempts to control caused him to carry over hostility towards biblical and Christian teachings to solve life's problems. This theme weaved through his writings throughout his life. &lt;ref name=abuse/&gt;

At the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, &quot;The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre,&quot; in the local Black newspaper ''Southern Register.'' No copies survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rayson2&quot;&gt;Rayson, Ann. &quot;Richard Wright's Life.&quot; [https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org ''Modern American Poetry''], Nelson, Cary and Brinkman, Bartholomew, eds. Department of English, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 7 of ''Black Boy'', he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher= Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 182–186 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, after excelling in grade school and junior high, Wright earned the position of class [[valedictorian]] of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; He was assigned to write a paper to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying &quot;the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 193–197 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. He was able to convince everyone to allow him to read the words he had written himself. &lt;ref name=&quot;abuse&quot; /&gt; 

In September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson—the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws—but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses. &lt;ref name=&quot;abuse&quot; /&gt;

In November 1925 at the age of 17, Wright moved on his own to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. There he fed his appetite for reading as he borrowed books from the segregated white library by convincing them he was assisting a white man.&lt;ref name=&quot;abuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fire&quot; /&gt; He planned to have his mother come and live with him once he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the [[Jim Crow economy|Jim Crow South]] and go to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 276–278|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family joined the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;fire&quot; /&gt;

Wright's childhood in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas, shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Black Boy |last=Wright |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-081250-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig/page/455 455]–459 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coming of age in Chicago  ===

Wright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (&quot;We of the Red Leaves of Red Books&quot;, for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109–10 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story &quot;Big Boy Leaves Home&quot; was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.

Pleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123–26 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a &quot;[[bourgeois]] intellectual.&quot;  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]]. He had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965|pages= 13–16 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents.  He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay &quot;I tried to be a Communist,&quot; published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger,'' but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126–34 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}. It remained an essay until the publication of ''American Hunger'' in 1977 and the complete ''Black Boy (American Hunger)'' in 1991. James Zeigler: ''Red Scare Racism and Cold War Black Radicalism.'' Jackson: Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2015, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knife point by [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveler]] co-workers, denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 [[May Day]] march.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= |title=The God That Failed |year=1965 |pages=143–45 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1937, Wright moved to New York, where he forged new ties with some Communist Party members. He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story &quot;Fire and Cloud&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot; /&gt;

After receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper &amp; Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.

Wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.

Based on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&amp;q=Herbert+and+jane+Newton&amp;pg=PT147|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Oleksinski, Johnny.

After publication, ''Native Son'' was selected by the [[Book of the Month Club]] as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.

Wright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''[[American Negro Exposition]]'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].

He traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.

Wright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.

''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Richard |editor1-last=Kinnamon |editor1-first=Keneth |editor1-link=Keneth Kinnamon |editor2-last=Fabre |editor2-first=Michel |editor2-link=Michel Fabre |date=1993 |title=Conversations with Richard Wright |location=Mississippi |publisher=University of Mississippi |page=xix |isbn=0-87805-632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned &quot;bourgeois&quot; books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.

He became a permanent American [[expatriate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/wright/wright_bio.html|title=Richard Wright Biography|author=|date=|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Wright became friends with French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], whom he met while still in New York, and he and his wife became particularly good friends with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who stayed with them in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails|publisher=Other Press|year=2016|isbn=9781590514894|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright's existentialist leanings were more influenced by [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and especially [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, Michel (1993). ''The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright.'' Tr. Isabel Barzun. Chicago, IL: University of Illinois Press. pp. 374&lt;/ref&gt; In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger &quot;directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [[existentialism]] and [[Marxism]] for Wright.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Hue (2019). &quot;Heidegger and ''The Outsider,'' ''Savage Holiday,'' and ''The Long Dream''&quot; in ''Critical Insights: Richard Wright,'' Ed. Kimberly Drake. Amenia, NY: Grey House, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[Existentialist]] phase was expressed in his second novel, ''[[The Outsider (Richard Wright)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay &quot;Everybody's Protest Novel&quot; (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''

After becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''

In mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called &quot;extraordinary pressure&quot; to avoid writing about the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;polsgrove80-81&quot;/&gt; As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, &quot;I Choose Exile,&quot; Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that &quot;a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polsgrove80-81&quot;/&gt; He thought the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.&lt;ref name=&quot;polsgrove80-81&quot;&gt;Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds'', pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisissoulone.tumblr.com/post/21392983785/richard-wright-i-choose-exile-i-am-a-native The essay &quot;I Choose Exile&quot; Online published accessed August 5,2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Wright visited [[Indonesia]] for the [[Bandung Conference]]. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153–153, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].&lt;!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html &quot;Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.

His agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.

On June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and &quot;four hassles in twelve days&quot; with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.

On February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].

In June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.

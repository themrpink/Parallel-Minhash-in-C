[[Possessive case|Possession]] in Thai is indicated by adding the word &quot;khong&quot; in front of the [[noun]] or [[pronoun]], but it may often be omitted. For example:
* ลูกของแม่ (luk khong mae) = &quot;child belonging to mother&quot; English = mother's child
* นาอา (na a) = &quot;field uncle&quot; English = uncle's field &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thailanguage.org/thai/grammar.asp|title= Thailanguage.org|access-date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
Subject [[pronoun]]s are often omitted, with [[nickname]]s used where English would use a pronoun. See [[Thai names#Formal and informal names|informal and formal names]] for more details. Pronouns, when used, are ranked in [[Thai honorifics|honorific registers]], and may also make a [[T–V distinction#Thai|T–V distinction]] in relation to [[kinship terminology|kinship]] and [[social status]]. Specialised pronouns are used for those with [[Thai royal and noble titles|royal and noble titles]], and for [[Bhikkhu|clergy]]. The following are appropriate for [[conversation]]al use:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| ฉัน || chan || {{IPA|[t͡ɕʰǎn]}} || I/me (mainly used by women; informal) Commonly pronounced as {{IPA|[t͡ɕʰán]}}
|-
| เรา || rao || {{IPA|[raw]}} || we/us, I/me (casual), you (sometimes used but only when older person speaks to younger person)
|-
| คุณ || khun || {{IPA|[kʰun]}} || you (polite)
|-
| ท่าน || than || {{IPA|[tʰân]}} || you (highly [[honorific]])
|-
| เธอ || thoe || {{IPA|[tʰɤː]}} || you (informal), she/her (informal)
|-
| พี่ || phi || {{IPA|[pʰîː]}} || older brother, sister (also used for older acquaintances)
|-

|-
| มัน || man || {{IPA|[man]}} || it, he/she (sometimes casual or offensive if used to refer to a person)
|}

The reflexive pronoun is ตัวเอง (tua eng), which can mean any of: myself, yourself, ourselves, himself, herself, themselves. This can be mixed with another pronoun to create an [[intensive pronoun]], such as ตัวผมเอง (tua phom eng, lit: I myself) or ตัวคุณเอง (tua khun eng, lit: you yourself). Thai also does not have a separate [[possessive pronoun]]. Instead, possession is indicated by the particle ของ (khong).  For example, &quot;my mother&quot; is แม่ของผม (mae khong phom, lit: mother of I). This particle is often implicit, so the phrase is shortened to แม่ผม (mae phom). Plural pronouns can be easily constructed by adding the word พวก (phuak) in front of a singular pronoun as in พวกเขา (phuak khao) meaning they or พวกเธอ (phuak thoe) meaning the plural sense of you. The only exception to this is เรา (rao), which can be used as singular (informal) or plural, but can also be used in the form of พวกเรา (phuak rao), which is only plural.

Thai has many more pronouns than those listed above. Their usage is full of nuances. For example:

* &quot;ผม เรา ฉัน ดิฉัน หนู กู ข้า กระผม ข้าพเจ้า กระหม่อม อาตมา กัน ข้าน้อย ข้าพระพุทธเจ้า อั๊ว เขา&quot; all translate to &quot;I&quot;, but each expresses a different gender, age, politeness, status, or relationship between speaker and listener.
* เรา (rao) can be first person (I), second person (you), or both (we), depending on the context.
* Children or younger female could use or being referred by word หนู (nu) when talking with older person. The word หนู could be both feminine first person (I) and feminine second person (you) and also neuter first and neuter second person for children.
** หนู commonly means rat or mouse, though it also refers to small creatures in general.
* The second person pronoun เธอ (thoe) (lit: you) is semi-feminine. It is used only when the speaker or the listener (or both) are female. Males usually don't address each other by this pronoun.
* Both คุณ (khun) and เธอ (thoe) are polite neuter second person pronouns.  However, คุณเธอ (khun thoe) is a feminine derogative third person.
* Instead of a second person pronoun such as &quot;คุณ&quot; (you), it is much more common for unrelated strangers to call each other &quot;พี่ น้อง ลุง ป้า น้า อา ตา ยาย&quot; (brother/sister/aunt/uncle/granny).
* To express deference, the second person pronoun is sometimes replaced by a profession, similar to how, in English, presiding judges are always addressed as &quot;your honor&quot; rather than &quot;you&quot;.  In Thai, students always address their teachers by &quot;ครู&quot; or &quot;คุณครู&quot; or &quot;อาจารย์&quot; (each means &quot;teacher&quot;) rather than คุณ (you).  Teachers, monks, and doctors are almost always addressed this way.

===Particles===
The [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s are often untranslatable words added to the end of a sentence to indicate respect, a request, encouragement or other moods (similar to the use of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in English), as well as varying the level of formality. They are not used in elegant (written) Thai. The most common particles indicating respect are ครับ (''khrap'', {{IPA|[kʰráp]}}, with a high tone) when the speaker is male, and ค่ะ (''kha'', {{IPA|[kʰâ]}}, with a falling tone) when the speaker is female. Used in a question or a request, the particle ค่ะ (falling tone) is changed to a คะ (high tone).

Other common particles are:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| จ๊ะ || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t͡ɕáʔ]}} || indicating a request
|-
| จ้ะ, จ้า or จ๋า || cha/ja || {{IPA|[t͡ɕâː]}} || indicating emphasis

|-
| สิ || si || {{IPA|[sìʔ]}} || indicating emphasis or an imperative
|-
| นะ || na || {{IPA|[náʔ]}} || softening; indicating a request
|}

== Register ==
As noted above, Thai has several registers, each having certain usages, such as colloquial, formal, literary, and poetic. Thus, the word &quot;eat&quot; can be กิน (''kin''; common), แดก (''daek''; vulgar), ยัด (''yat''; vulgar), บริโภค (''boriphok''; formal), รับประทาน (''rapprathan''; formal), ฉัน (''chan''; religious), or เสวย (''sawoei''; royal), as illustrated below:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

| กิน || /kīn/ || common ||

| ยัด || /ját/ || vulgar|| Original meaning is 'to cram'
|-
| บริโภค || /bɔ̄ː.ri.pʰôːk/ || formal, literary ||

Thailand also uses the distinctive [[Thai six-hour clock]] in addition to the [[24-hour clock]].

==Vocabulary==
{{Main|List of loanwords in Thai}}
Other than [[compound word]]s and words of foreign origin, most words are [[syllable|monosyllabic]].

Chinese-language influence was strong until the 13th century when the use of Chinese characters was abandoned, and replaced by Sanskrit and Pali scripts. However, the vocabulary of Thai retains many words borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor ''Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook'' 2009 -- Page 611 &quot;Thai is of special interest to lexical borrowing for various reasons. The copious borrowing of basic vocabulary from Middle Chinese and later from Khmer indicates that, given the right sociolinguistic context, such vocabulary is not at all immune ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harald Haarmann Language in Ethnicity: A View of Basic Ecological Relations 1986- Page 165 &quot;In Thailand, for instance, where the Chinese influence was strong until the Middle Ages, Chinese characters were abandoned in written Thai in the course of the thirteenth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Leppert Doing Business With Thailand -1992 Page 13 &quot;At an early time the Thais used Chinese characters. But, under the influence of Indian traders and monks, they soon dropped Chinese characters in favor of Sanskrit and Pali scripts.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Later most vocabulary was borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]; [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] terminology is particularly indebted to these. Indic words have a more formal register, and may be compared to Latin and French borrowings in English. Old [[Khmer language|Khmer]] has also contributed its share, especially in regard to royal court terminology. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the [[English language]] has had the greatest influence, especially for scientific, technical, international, and other modern terms.

=== Portuguese-origin ===
The Portuguese were the first Western nation to arrive in what is modern-day Thailand in the 16th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya period]]. Their influence in trade, especially weaponry, allowed them to establish a community just outside the capital and practice their faith, as well as exposing and converting the locals to [[Christianity]]. Thus, Portuguese words involving trade and religion were introduced and used by the locals.

'''''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''''' is a [[fantasy novel]] written by British author [[J. K. Rowling]]. The first novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and Rowling's [[debut novel]], it follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.

The book was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] on 26 June 1997 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. It was published in the [[United States]] the following year by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the title '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name]], as have all six of its sequels.

Most reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], one of Rowling's favourite authors; [[Roald Dahl]], whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller [[Homer]]. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian [[boarding school]] stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies.

''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote [[witchcraft]] under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of [[wikt:object lesson|object lessons]] in [[Education#Teaching|educational techniques]], [[sociology|sociological analysis]] and marketing.

Harry Potter has been living a difficult life, constantly abused by his surly and cold aunt and uncle, [[Dursley family|Vernon and Petunia Dursley]] and bullied by their spoiled son Dudley since the death of his parents ten years prior. His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered by a half-giant named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]], who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, [[Lord Voldemort]], which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.

Hagrid introduces Harry to the [[wizarding world]] by bringing him to [[Diagon Alley]], a hidden street in London, where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. He also receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand (which he learns shares a core from the same source as Voldemort's wand). There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards as &quot;The Boy Who Lived&quot;. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]]'s secret Hogwarts platform, [[Platform 9¾|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]]. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year [[Ronald Weasley]] and the two boys meet [[Hermione Granger]], whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, [[Draco Malfoy]], who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.

Arriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [[Sorting Hat]] to [[House system|Houses]] that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being [[Gryffindor]], [[Slytherin]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.

As classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers he has a talent for [[Broom#Magic|flying on broomsticks]], and is recruited into his House's team for [[Quidditch]] (a sport sharing similarities to [[Association football|football]]) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student [[Neville Longbottom]] asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's [[Halloween]] celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.

Hermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true. Within the Mirror, Harry sees himself standing with both of his parents.

A visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault—the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a [[Philosopher's Stone]], which grants its user [[immortality]] as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure [[gold]]. Harry is also informed by a centaur named [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.

They encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's [[chess]]. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.

==Quantum Evolution in Plants==

Usage of the phrase &quot;quantum evolution&quot; in plants was apparently first articulated by [[Verne Grant]] in 1963 (pp. 458-459).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Verne|title=The Origin of Adaptations|url=https://archive.org/details/originofadaptati0000gran|url-access=registration|date=1963|publisher=Columbia Universitiy Press|location=New York and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/originofadaptati0000gran/page/606 606]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He cited an earlier 1958 paper by Harlan Lewis  and [[Peter H. Raven]],&lt;ref name =&quot;Cates&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Harlan|last2=Raven|first2=Peter H.|title=Rapid Evolution in Clarkia|journal=Evolution|date=1958|volume=12|issue=3|pages=319–336|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1958.tb02962.x|s2cid=88373329}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Grant asserted that Lewis and Raven gave a &quot;parallel&quot; definition of quantum evolution as defined by Simpson.   Lewis and Raven postulated that species in the Genus [[Clarkia]] had a mode of speciation that resulted &lt;blockquote&gt;...as a consequence of a rapid reorganization of the chromosomes due to the presence, at some time, of a genotype conducive to extensive chromosome breakage. A similar mode of origin by rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is suggested for the derivation of other species of [[Clarkia]]. In all of these examples the derivative populations grow adjacent to the parental species, which they resemble closely in morphology, but from which they are reproductively isolated because of multiple structural differences in their chromosomes. The spatial relationship of each parental species and its derivative suggests that differentiation has been recent. The repeated occurrence of the same pattern of differentiation in Clarkia suggests that a rapid reorganization of chromosomes has been an important mode of evolution in the genus. This rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is comparable to the systemic mutations proposed by [[Richard Goldschmidt|Goldschmidt]] as a mechanism of [[Macroevolution|macroevolution]]. In [[Clarkia]], we have not observed marked changes in physiology and pattern of development that could be described as macroevolution. Reorganization of the genomes may, however, set the stage for subsequent evolution along a very different course from that of the ancestral populations&lt;ref name =&quot;Cates&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Harlan Lewis]] refined this concept in a 1962 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Harlan|title=Catastrophic Selection as a Factor in Speciation|journal=Evolution|date=1962|volume=16|issue=3|pages=257–271|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1962.tb03218.x|s2cid=88311196}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he coined the term  &quot;Catastrophic Speciation&quot; to describe this mode of speciation, since he theorized that the reductions in population size and consequent inbreeding that led to chromosomal rearrangements occurred in small populations that were subject to severe drought.

[[Leslie D. Gottlieb]] in his 2003 summary of the subject in plants stated&lt;ref name= &quot;Rethink&quot; &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gottlieb|first1=L.D.|title=Rethinking classic examples of recent speciation in plants|journal=New Phytologist|date=2003|volume=161|pages=71–82|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;we can define quantum speciation as the budding off of a new and very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, quantum speciation is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;   Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required [[Disruptive selection|disruptive selection]] to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was &quot;unnecessarily restrictive&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;AmJBot&quot; &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gottlieb|first1=L.D.|title=Genetic Differentiation, Sympatric Speciation, and the Origin of a Diploid Species of Stephanomeria|journal=American Journal of Botany|date=1973|volume=60|issue=6|pages=545–553|doi=10.2307/2441378|jstor=2441378}}&lt;/ref&gt; in identifying cases of sympatric speciation. In this 2003 paper Gottlieb summarized instances of quantum evolution in the plant species [[Clarkia]], [[Layia]], and [[Stephanomeria]].

==Mechanisms==
According to Simpson (1944), quantum evolution resulted from [[Sewall Wright]]'s model of [[genetic drift|random genetic drift]]. Simpson believed that major evolutionary transitions would arise when small populations, that were [[Allopatric speciation|isolated]] and limited from [[gene flow]], would fixate upon unusual gene combinations. This &quot;inadaptive phase&quot; (caused by genetic drift) would then (by natural selection) drive a [[deme (biology)|deme population]] from one stable adaptive peak to another on the [[fitness landscape|adaptive fitness landscape]]. However, in his ''Major Features of Evolution'' (1953) Simpson wrote that this mechanism was still controversial:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;&quot;whether prospective adaptation as prelude to quantum evolution arises adaptively or inadaptively. It was concluded above that it usually arises adaptively . . . . The precise role of, say, genetic drift in this process thus is largely speculative at present. It may have an essential part or none. It surely is not involved in all cases of quantum evolution, but there is a strong possibility that it is often involved. If or when it is involved, it is an initiating mechanism. Drift can only rarely, and only for lower categories, have completed the transition to a new adaptive zone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1953). ''[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/simpson_evolutionary-rates.html The Major Features of Evolution]'', p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

This preference for adaptive over inadaptive forces led [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to call attention to the &quot;hardening of the Modern Synthesis&quot;, a trend in the 1950s where adaptationism took precedence over the pluralism of mechanisms common in the 1930s and 40s.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1983). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_synthesis.html &quot;The hardening of the Modern Synthesis&quot;] In Marjorie Grene, ed., ''Dimensions of Darwinism''. Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson considered quantum evolution his crowning achievement, being &quot;perhaps the most important outcome of [my] investigation, but also the most controversial and hypothetical.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simpson1944p206&quot;/&gt;

Many of Keaton's films from the 1920s remain highly regarded, such as ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924), ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' (1926), and ''[[The Cameraman]]'' (1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/keatonbuster.php |title=Buster Keaton's Acclaimed Films |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''The General'' widely viewed as his masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://mubi.com/lists/sight-and-sound-critics-poll-2002-top-films-of-all-time | title=''Sight &amp; Sound'' Critics' Poll (2002): Top Films of All Time| publisher= Sight &amp; Sound via [[Mubi.com]]| accessdate=January 29, 2016| archive-date=January 29, 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129151429/https://mubi.com/lists/sight-and-sound-critics-poll-2002-top-films-of-all-time | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Three other Keaton films received votes in the magazine's survey: ''[[Our Hospitality]]'', ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', and ''[[The Navigator (1924 film)|The Navigator]]''.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aae85f3/sightandsoundpoll2012 |title=Votes for The General (1924) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/general-greatest-comedy-all-time | title=The General: the greatest comedy of all time?| first=Geoff |last=Andrew |date= January 23, 2014|work=Sight &amp; Sound|accessdate= January 28, 2016|archive-date= September 6, 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906131312/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/general-greatest-comedy-all-time|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its strongest admirers was [[Orson Welles]], who stated that ''The General'' was cinema's highest achievement in comedy, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;Orson Welles interview, from the Kino November 10, 2009 Blu-Ray edition of The General&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton in 1996 was recognized as the seventh-greatest film director by ''Entertainment Weekly'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.ew.com/article/1996/04/19/50-greatest-directors-and-their-100-best-movies/2 | title=The 50 Greatest Directors and Their 100 Best Movies| work=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 19, 1996 | page= 2 |accessdate = January 28, 2016| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626234359/http://www.ew.com/article/1996/04/19/50-greatest-directors-and-their-100-best-movies/2 | archive-date= June 26, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Film Institute]] ranked him in 1999 as the 21st greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx | title = AFI Recognizes the 50 Greatest American Screen Legends | publisher = American Film Institute | date = June 16, 1999 | accessdate = August 31, 2013 | archive-date = January 13, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130113043532/http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx | url-status =live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early life in vaudeville ===
Keaton was born into a [[vaudeville]] family in [[Piqua, Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-first=Keith |editor-last=Stokes |url=http://www.kansastravel.org/busterkeatonmuseum.htm |title=Buster Keaton Museum |publisher=KansasTravel.org |accessdate=February 17, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160116052738/http://www.kansastravel.org/busterkeatonmuseum.htm | archive-date= January 16, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; the small town where his mother, [[Myra Keaton]] (née Cutler), was when she went into labor. He was named &quot;Joseph&quot; to continue a tradition on his father's side (he was sixth in a line bearing the name Joseph Keaton)&lt;ref name=&quot;Meade16&quot; /&gt; and &quot;Frank&quot; for his maternal grandfather, who disapproved of his parents' union. Later, Keaton changed his middle name to &quot;Francis&quot;.&lt;ref name=Meade16 /&gt; His father was [[Joe Keaton|Joseph Hallie &quot;Joe&quot; Keaton]], who owned a traveling show with [[Harry Houdini]] called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company or the Keaton Houdini Medicine Show Company, which performed on stage and sold [[patent medicine]] on the side.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/367547084/|title=County Correspondence|date=March 19, 1896|work=The Butler County Democrat, El Dorado, Kansas|access-date=November 11, 2019|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Threekeatons.jpg|thumb|left|Six-year-old Buster with his parents Myra and Joe Keaton during a vaudeville act]]

According to a frequently repeated story, which may be apocryphal,&lt;ref name=TCMSundays /&gt; Keaton acquired the nickname &quot;Buster&quot; at the age of about 18 months. An actor friend named George Pardey was present one day when the young Keaton took a tumble down a long flight of stairs without injury. After the infant sat up and shook off his experience, Pardey remarked, &quot;He's a regular buster!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meade_19&quot;&gt;Meade, Marion (2014). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cIqAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19 Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase: A Biography]''. Open Road Media. p. 19. {{ISBN|1497602319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Keaton's father began to use the nickname to refer to the youngster. Keaton retold the anecdote over the years, including a 1964 interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Telescope: Deadpan: An Interview with Buster Keaton'', 1964 interview of Buster and Eleanor Keaton by [[Fletcher Markle]] for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Keaton's retelling, he was six months old when the incident occurred, and Harry Houdini gave him the nickname.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meade_19&quot;/&gt;

At the age of three, Keaton began performing with his parents in The Three Keatons. He first appeared on stage in 1899 in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The act was mainly a comedy sketch. Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Buster performed on center stage. The young Keaton would goad his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton would respond by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience. A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing. The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage. This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of [[child abuse]], and occasionally, arrest. However, Buster Keaton was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones. He was eventually billed as &quot;The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged&quot;, with the overall act being advertised as &quot;The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/bio1.htm |title=Part I: A Vaudeville Childhood |publisher=[[International Buster Keaton Society]] |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |archive-date=January 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108225544/http://www.busterkeaton.com/bio1.htm |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, Keaton said that he was never hurt by his father and that the falls and physical comedy were a matter of proper technical execution. In 1914, Keaton told the ''[[Detroit News]]'': &quot;The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand. It's a knack. I started so young that landing right is second nature with me. Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat. Imitators of our act don't last long, because they can't stand the treatment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bk&quot; /&gt;

Keaton claimed he was having so much fun that he would sometimes begin laughing as his father threw him across the stage. Noticing that this drew fewer laughs from the audience, he adopted his famous deadpan expression whenever he was working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/keaton.html |title=Buster Keaton |publisher=Archive.sensesofcinema.com |date=February 1, 1966 |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202061846/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/keaton.html |archive-date=February 2, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act ran up against laws banning child performers in vaudeville. According to one biographer, Keaton was made to go to school while performing in New York, but only attended for part of one day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180507004412/http://www.busterkeaton.org/bio1/ Biography: Part 1. www.busterkeaton.org]. Retrieved August 26, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite tangles with the law and a disastrous tour of [[music hall]]s in the United Kingdom, Keaton was a rising star in the theater. Keaton stated that he learned to read and write late, and was taught by his mother. By the time he was 21, his father's alcoholism threatened the reputation of the family act,&lt;ref name=&quot;bk&quot; /&gt; so Keaton and his mother, Myra, left for New York, where Buster Keaton's career swiftly moved from vaudeville to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/partii.htm |title=Part II:The Flickers |publisher=International Buster Keaton Society |date=October 13, 1924 |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |archive-date=March 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303033019/http://www.busterkeaton.com/partii.htm |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Information taken from &quot;Buster, A Legend in Laughter&quot;, by Larry Edwards--&gt;

Keaton served in the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] in [[France]] with the [[United States Army]]'s [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] during [[World War I]]. His unit remained intact and was not broken up to provide replacements, as happened to some other late-arriving divisions. During his time in uniform, he suffered an ear infection that permanently impaired his hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/buster.htm |title=My Career at the Rear / Buster Keaton in World War I |author=Martha R.

[[File:Keaton Cops pt1.ogg|thumb|A clip from the beginning of ''Cops'' (1922)]]

In February 1917, Keaton met [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle]] at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to [[Joseph Schenck|Joseph M. Schenck]]. Joe Keaton disapproved of films, and Buster also had reservations about the medium. During his first meeting with Arbuckle, he was asked to jump in and start acting. Buster was such a natural when making his first film ''[[The Butcher Boy (1917 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' he was hired on the spot. At the end of the day's work, he asked to borrow one of the cameras to get a feel for how it worked. He took the camera back to his hotel room where he dismantled and reassembled it by morning.&lt;ref&gt;Prikryl, Jana (July 9, 2011), &quot;The Genius of Buster&quot;, ''The New York Review of Books'', '''58''' (10): 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton later claimed that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department. He appeared in a total of 14 Arbuckle shorts, running into 1920. They were popular, and contrary to Keaton's later reputation as &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, he often smiled and even laughed in them. Keaton and Arbuckle became close friends, and Keaton was one of few people, along with [[Charlie Chaplin]], to defend Arbuckle's character during accusations that he was responsible for the death of actress [[Virginia Rappe]]. (Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, with an apology from the jury for the ordeal he had undergone. &lt;ref&gt;Yallop, David (1976). The Day the Laughter Stopped. New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-18410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;!-- Edwards says Arbuckle and Keaton met at Talmadge; the IMDB says &quot;Butcher Boy&quot; was made at Colony Studios in NYC (source?)  --&gt;

In 1920, ''[[The Saphead]]'' was released, in which Keaton had his first starring role in a full-length feature. It was based on a successful play, ''The New Henrietta'', which had already been filmed once, under the title ''The Lamb'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks]] playing the lead. Fairbanks recommended Keaton to take the role for the remake five years later, since the film was to have a comic slant.

After Keaton's successful work with Arbuckle, Schenck gave him his own production unit, Buster Keaton Productions. He made a series of two-reel comedies, including ''[[One Week (1920 film)|One Week]]'' (1920), ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'' (1921), ''[[Cops (1922)|Cops]]'' (1922), and ''[[The Electric House]]'' (1922). Keaton then moved to full-length features.

Keaton's writers included [[Clyde Bruckman]], Joseph Mitchell, and [[Jean Havez]], but the most ingenious gags were generally conceived by Keaton himself. Comedy director [[Leo McCarey]], recalling the freewheeling days of making [[slapstick]] comedies, said, &quot;All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen. But we had no luck with Keaton, because he thought up his best gags himself and we couldn't steal ''him!''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard, The Great Movie Comedians, Bell Publishing, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The more adventurous ideas called for dangerous stunts, performed by Keaton at great physical risk. During the railroad water-tank scene in ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward. A scene from ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' required Keaton to stand still on a particular spot. Then, the facade of a two-story building toppled forward on top of Keaton. Keaton's character emerged unscathed, due to a single open window. The stunt required precision, because the prop house weighed two tons, and the window only offered a few inches of clearance around Keaton's body. The sequence furnished one of the most memorable images of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/b/busterkeatondf.shtml |title=Reviews : The General/Steamboat Bill Jr |publisher=The DVD Journal |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OutWest1918-01.jpg|thumb|right|Keaton with [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] and [[Al St. John]] in [[Film still|still]] from ''[[Out West (1918 film)|Out West]]'' (1918)]]

Aside from ''Steamboat Bill, Jr.'' (1928), Keaton's most enduring feature-length films include ''[[Our Hospitality]]'' (1923), ''[[The Navigator (1924 film)|The Navigator]]'' (1924), ''Sherlock Jr.'' (1924), ''[[Seven Chances]]'' (1925), ''The Cameraman'' (1928), and ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' (1926). ''The General'', set during the [[American Civil War]], combined physical comedy with Keaton's love of trains, including an epic locomotive chase. Employing picturesque locations, the film's storyline reenacted an [[Great Locomotive Chase|actual wartime incident]]. Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton's greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time. It was too dramatic for some filmgoers expecting a lightweight comedy, and reviewers questioned Keaton's judgment in making a comedic film about the Civil War, even while noting it had a &quot;few laughs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2006-11-10/article/25592?headline=Moving-Pictures-Buster-Keaton-s-General-Pulls-In-To-PFA |title=Moving Pictures: Buster Keaton's 'General' Pulls In To PFA.

It was an expensive misfire, and Keaton was never entrusted with total control over his films again. His distributor, [[United Artists]], insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements. Keaton endured this treatment for two more feature films, and then exchanged his independent setup for employment at Hollywood's biggest studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Keaton's loss of independence as a filmmaker coincided with the coming of sound films (although he was interested in making the transition) and mounting personal problems, and his career in the early sound era was hurt as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;b-k&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buster-keaton.com/ |title=Buster-Keaton.com |publisher=Buster-Keaton.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301060958/http://www.buster-keaton.com/ |archive-date=March 1, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sound era ====
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--first portion has no citations--&gt;
[[File:Parlor, Bedroom and Bath (1).jpg|thumb|right|With [[Charlotte Greenwood]] in one of his first &quot;talkies&quot;, ''[[Parlor, Bedroom and Bath (1931 film)|Parlor, Bedroom and Bath]]'' (1931)]]

Keaton signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1928, a business decision that he would later call the worst of his life. He realized too late that the [[studio system]] MGM represented would severely limit his creative input. For instance, the studio refused his request to make his early project, ''[[Spite Marriage]]'', as a sound film and after the studio converted, he was obliged to adhere to dialogue-laden scripts. However, MGM did allow Keaton some creative participation on his last originally developed/written silent film ''[[The Cameraman]]'', 1928, which was his first project under contract with them, but hired [[Edward Sedgwick]] as the official director.

[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|left|Keaton, [[Thelma Todd]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] in ''[[Speak Easily]]'' (1932)]]
Keaton was forced to use a stunt double during some of the more dangerous scenes, something he had never done in his heyday, as MGM wanted badly to protect its investment. &quot;Stuntmen don't get laughs,&quot; Keaton had said. Some of his most financially successful films for the studio were during this period. MGM tried teaming the laconic Keaton with the rambunctious [[Jimmy Durante]] in a series of films, ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]'', ''[[Speak Easily]]'', and ''[[What! No Beer?]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson&quot;&gt;Everson, William K.  ''American Silent Film''.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1978.  p. 274-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter would be Keaton's last starring feature in his home country. The films proved popular. (Thirty years later, both Keaton and Durante had cameo roles in ''[[It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World]]'', albeit not in the same scenes.)

In the first Keaton pictures with sound, he and his fellow actors would shoot each scene three times: one in English, one in Spanish, and one in either French or German. The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after. This is discussed in the TCM documentary ''Buster Keaton: So Funny it Hurt'', with Keaton complaining about having to shoot lousy films not just once, but three times.

Keaton was so demoralized during the production of 1933's ''What! No Beer?'' that MGM fired him after the filming was complete, despite the film being a resounding hit. In 1934, Keaton accepted an offer to make an independent film in Paris, ''[[Le Roi des Champs-Élysées]]''. During this period, he made another film, in England, ''[[The Invader (1935 film)|The Invader]]'' (released in the United States as ''An Old Spanish Custom'' in 1936).&lt;ref name=&quot;Everson&quot; /&gt;

==== Educational Pictures ====
Upon Keaton's return to Hollywood in 1934, he made a screen comeback in two-reel comedies for [[Educational Pictures]]. Most of these 16 films are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill, David|first=Brownlow, Kevin|title=Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow|year=1987|publisher=Thames Television|pages=Episode three}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high point in the Educational series is ''Grand Slam Opera'' (1936), featuring Buster in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant. 

==== Gag writer ====
When the Educational series lapsed in 1937, Keaton returned to MGM as a gag writer, supplying material for the final three [[Marx Brothers]] MGM films ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939), ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' (1940), and ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941); these were not as artistically successful as the Marxes' previous MGM features.

==== Columbia Pictures ====
In 1939, [[Columbia Pictures]] hired Keaton to star in 10 two-reel comedies; the series ran for two years, and comprise his last series as a starring comedian. The director was usually [[Jules White]], whose emphasis on [[slapstick]] and [[farce]] made most of these films resemble White's famous [[Three Stooges]] shorts. Keaton's personal favorite was the series's debut, ''[[Pest from the West]]'', a shorter, tighter remake of Keaton's little-viewed 1934 feature ''The Invader''; it was directed not by White but by [[Del Lord]], a veteran director for [[Mack Sennett]]. Moviegoers and exhibitors welcomed Keaton's Columbia comedies, proving that the comedian had not lost his appeal. However, director White's insistence on blunt, violent gags resulted in the Columbia shorts being the least inventive comedies he made. The final entry was ''[[She's Oil Mine]]'' (1941), a two-reel reworking of Keaton's 1932 feature ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]''. Columbia and White wanted to sign Keaton for more shorts but the comedian declined, resolving that he would never again &quot;make another crummy two-reeler.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Okuda&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Okuda |first= Ted |author-link= Ted Okuda |author2=Watz, Edward |title= ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts'' |publisher= McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers |year= 1986 |page= 139 |isbn= 0-89950-181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1940s and feature films ====
Keaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage to MGM dancer Eleanor Norris, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Resuming his daily job as an MGM gag writer, he provided material for [[Red Skelton]]&lt;ref name=&quot;p34&quot;&gt;Knopf, Robert ''The Theater and Cinema of Buster Keaton'' By [https://books.google.com/books?id=fU5qDx7tawIC&amp;pg=PA34 p.34]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave help and advice to [[Lucille Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kathleenbrady.net/lucille_the_life_of_lucille_ball_18269.htm|title=Lucille The Life of Lucille Ball&amp;nbsp;– Kathleen Brady|author=Kathleen Brady|date=May 31, 2014|work=kathleenbrady.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keaton accepted various character roles in both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; features. He made his last starring feature ''El Moderno Barba Azul'' (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low-budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title ''[[Boom in the Moon]]''. 

Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger &quot;prestige&quot; pictures. He had cameos in such films as ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949), ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). In ''In the Good Old Summertime'', Keaton personally directed the stars [[Judy Garland]] and [[Van Johnson]] in their first scene together, where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress.

Keaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (released in 1952), recalling the vaudeville of ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]''. With the exception of ''Seeing Stars'', a minor publicity film produced in 1922, ''Limelight'' was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film.

=== Television and rediscovery ===
[[File:BusterKeatonKBF1956.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Keaton getting his foot stuck in railroad tracks at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in 1956]]
In 1949, comedian [[Ed Wynn]] invited Keaton to appear on his [[CBS Television]] comedy-variety show, ''The Ed Wynn Show'', which was televised live on the West Coast. [[Kinescope]]s were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country, since there was no transcontinental [[coaxial cable]] until September 1951. Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live, in 1950.

''Life with Buster Keaton'' (1951) was an attempt to recreate the first series on film, allowing the program to be broadcast nationwide. The series benefited from a company of veteran actors, including [[Marcia Mae Jones]] as the ingenue, [[Iris Adrian]], [[Dick Wessel]], [[Fuzzy Knight]], [[Dub Taylor]], [[Philip Van Zandt]], and his silent-era contemporaries [[Harold Goodwin (American actor)|Harold Goodwin]], [[Hank Mann]], and stuntman Harvey Parry. Buster Keaton's wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Buster's Romeo in a little-theater vignette). The theatrical feature film ''The Misadventures of Buster Keaton'' was fashioned from the series. Keaton said that he canceled the filmed series himself, because he was unable to create enough fresh material to produce a new show each week. 

Keaton's periodic television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s helped to revive interest in his silent films. He appeared in the early television series ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]''. Whenever a TV show wanted to simulate silent-movie comedy, Buster Keaton answered the call and guested in such successful series as ''[[The Ken Murray Show]]'', ''[[You Asked for It]]'', and ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Well into his fifties, Keaton successfully recreated his old routines, including one stunt in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor. [[Garry Moore]] recalled, &quot;I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you.' He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it—it ''hurt''—but you had to care enough not to care.&quot;

=== Silent films revived ===
In 1954, Buster and Eleanor Keaton met film programmer [[Raymond Rohauer]], with whom they developed a business partnership to re-release his films. Actor [[James Mason]] had bought the Keatons' house and found numerous cans of films, among which was Keaton's long-lost classic ''[[The Boat (1921 film)|The Boat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2009/24/5-for-the-day-james-mason |title=The House Next Door: 5 for the Day: James Mason |publisher=www.slantmagazine.com |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton had prints of the features ''[[Three Ages]]'', ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'', and ''[[College (1927 film)|College]]'' (missing one reel), and the shorts &quot;The Boat&quot; and &quot;[[My Wife's Relations]]&quot;, which Keaton and Rohauer then transferred to [[Cellulose acetate film]] from deteriorating [[nitrate film]] stock.&lt;ref name=videomagazine1987&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/162200710/Buster-Keaton-Interviews-with-his-widow-with-Raymond-Rohauer-and-with-Kevin-Brownlow |first=Frank |last=Lovece |author-link=Frank Lovece |work=Video |date=June 1987 |title=Where's Buster?

On April 3, 1957, Keaton was surprised by [[Ralph Edwards]] for the weekly NBC program ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. The program also promoted the release of the biographical film ''[[The Buster Keaton Story]]'' with [[Donald O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/calendar/calendardetails.aspx?details_type=2&amp;id=373 |title=Series Details |publisher=Cinema.ucla.edu |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1958, Keaton was a guest star in the episode &quot;A Very Merry Christmas&quot; of ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' on ABC. He returned to the program in 1965 in the episode &quot;Now You See It, Now You Don't&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0564206/ |title=&quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; A Very Merry Christmas (1958) |publisher=Us.imdb.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, Keaton played mute King Sextimus the Silent in the national touring company of the Broadway musical ''[[Once Upon A Mattress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase|last=Meade |first=Marion|year=1997|publisher=Da Capo |isbn=0-306-80802-1|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he returned to MGM for the final time, playing a lion tamer in a [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960 film)|1960 adaptation]] of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''. Much of the film was shot on location on the [[Sacramento River]], which doubled for the [[Mississippi River]] setting of Twain's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) |first=Bosley | last=Crowther |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 4, 1960 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04E6D7163CEF3ABC4C53DFBE66838B679EDE |author-link=Bosley Crowther}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he starred in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode &quot;[[Once Upon a Time (The Twilight Zone)|Once Upon a Time]]&quot;, which included both silent and sound sequences. He worked with comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]] on a television pilot tentatively titled &quot;Medicine Man,&quot; shooting scenes for it on January 12, 1962—the day before Kovacs died in a car crash. &quot;Medicine Man&quot; was completed but not aired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=szoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4585,4182020&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|date=February 8, 1962|last=Spiro | first = J.

Keaton also found steady work as an actor in TV commercials, including a series of silent ads for Simon Pure Beer made in 1962 by Jim Mohr in [[Buffalo, New York]], in which he revisited some of the gags from his silent film days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/buster-keaton-for-simon-pure-beer/|title=Buster Keaton For Simon Pure Beer&amp;nbsp;– Brookston Beer Bulletin|date=October 4, 2015|newspaper=Brookston Beer Bulletin|language=en-US|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

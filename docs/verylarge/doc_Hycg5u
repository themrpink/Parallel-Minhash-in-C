'''Echion''' ({{lang-grc|Έχίων}}), also known as '''Aetion''', was a celebrated [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Painting|painter]] spoken of by [[Lucian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]], ''De Merced. Cond.'' 42, ''Herod'', or ''Aëtion'', 4, &amp;c., ''Imag.'' 7.&lt;/ref&gt; who gives a description of one of his pictures, representing the marriage of Alexander and Roxana. This painting excited such admiration when exhibited at the [[Olympic Games]], that Proxenidas, one of the judges, gave the artist his daughter in marriage. Echion seems to have excelled particularly in the art of mixing and laying on his colors. It has commonly been supposed that he lived in the time of [[Alexander the Great]]; but the words of Lucian show clearly that he must have lived about the time of [[Hadrian]] and the [[Antonines]]. [[Aloys Hirt]] supposes that the name of the painter of Alexander's marriage, whom Lucian praises so highly, as Aetion, is a corruption of Echion.&lt;ref&gt;Gesch. d. Bild.

[[Sandro Botticelli]] drew on Lucian's [[ekphrasis]] in his [[Mars and Venus (Botticelli)|''Mars and Venus'']] (c. 1485, now [[National Gallery]]), borrowing the amoretti playing with Alexander's armour during the ceremony, two carrying his lance and one who has crawled inside his breastplate.

'''Grand Canyon National Park''', located in northwestern [[Arizona]], is the 15th site in the United States to have been named as a [[national park]]. The park's central feature is the [[Grand Canyon]], a [[Canyon|gorge]] of the [[Colorado River]], which is often considered one of the [[Wonders of the World]]. The park, which covers {{convert|1,217,262|acre|sqmi km2}} of [[unincorporated area]] in [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]] and [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave]] counties, received more than six million recreational visitors in 2017, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;visitation&quot;&gt;{{NPS visitation|accessdate=2019-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Canyon was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Grand Canyon Centennial History |url=http://time.com/5530901/grand-canyon-centennial-history/ |magazine=TIME |access-date=19 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Grand Canyon poster 1938.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1938 poster of the park]]
The Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/historyculture/upload/chapter1.pdf |title=Polishing the Jewel: An Administrative History of Grand Canyon National Park |last=Anderson |first=Michael F. |publisher=Grand Canyon Association |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited the site and said, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/grand-canyon-national-park-presents-living-history-performance-of-president-theodore-roosevelt.htm |title=Grand Canyon National Park Presents Living History Performance of President Theodore Roosevelt |last=Pryputniewicz |first=Vanya |last2=Peterson |first2=Peter |publisher=nps.gov |access-date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in [[Conservation movement|preserving land]] for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator [[Benjamin Harrison]], which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Mackinac National Park|Mackinac]]. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after [[1888 United States presidential election|his election]] to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by [[Executive order|proclamation]] on 28 November 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title16/pdf/USCODE-2011-title16-chap6-sec687.pdf |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112741/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title16/pdf/USCODE-2011-title16-chap6-sec687.pdf |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Grand Canyon [[National Monument]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|35|2175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act was finally signed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on February 26, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Yanagihara |first=Wendy |title=Grand Canyon National Park |last2=Denniston |first2=Jennifer |date=2008 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1741044836 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Park Service]], established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.

The creation of the park was an early success of the [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]]. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] would be built upriver.) In 1975, the former [[Marble Canyon]] National Monument, which followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to [[Lee's Ferry]], was made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]]. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/nature/airoverflights_documents.htm | title=Overflights - Documents - Grand Canyon National Park (U.S. National Park Service)}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 
&quot;Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.&quot; 
In 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the [[America the Beautiful Quarters]] program.&lt;ref name=&quot;quarters&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://grandcanyonsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/grand-canyon.pdf |title=Grand Canyon Coin Introduced |year=2010 |website=[[United States Mint]] |access-date=27 February 2015 |quote=The Grand Canyon National Park Quarter is the fourth coin of 2010 in the America the Beautiful Quarters® Program. The reverse image features a view of the granaries above the Nankoweap Delta in Marble Canyon near the Colorado River.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:NPS grand-canyon-regional-map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Grand Canyon regional map]]
The Grand Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to [[Precambrian]] times. The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the [[Colorado Plateau]] was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.

The primary public areas of the park are the South and North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by [[pack trail]] and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;grca1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/north-rim.htm |title=North Rim |website=Grand Canyon National Park |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park headquarters are at [[Grand Canyon Village, Arizona|Grand Canyon Village]], not far from the South Entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.

===South Rim===
[[File:Grand Canyon Powell Point Evening Light 02 2013.jpg|thumb|left|From Powell Point on the South Rim]]
Most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on [[Arizona State Route 64]]. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near [[Tusayan, Arizona]], and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rand&quot;&gt;Rand McNally; National Park Guide; Michael Frome; Rand McNally &amp; Company, Chicago; 1970; pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interstate 40]] provides access to the area from the south. From the north, [[U.S. Route 89]] connects [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and the North Rim to the South Rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rand McNally |title=Road Atlas |date=2010 |location=United States, Canada, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= South Rim Pocket Map and Services Guide |url=https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/shuttle-buses.htm |website=National Park Service |accessdate=20 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=May 2017}}

===North Rim===
[[File:Cape Royal Sunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset at Cape Royal Point, North Rim]]
The [[North Rim, Arizona|North Rim]] area of the park is located on the [[Kaibab Plateau]] and Walhalla Plateau, directly across the Grand Canyon from the principal visitor areas on the South Rim. The North Rim's principal visitor areas are centered around Bright Angel Point. The North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, at over {{convert|8000|ft|m}} of elevation. Because it is so much higher than the South Rim, it is closed from December 1 through May 15 each year, due to the enhanced snowfall at elevation. Visitor services are closed or limited in scope after October 15. Driving time from the South Rim to the North Rim is about 4.5 hours, over {{convert|220|mi|km}}.
&lt;ref name=&quot;grca1&quot; /&gt;

====Services====
[[Grand Canyon Village, Arizona|Grand Canyon Village]] is the primary visitor services area in the park. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthRim&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=National Park Service |title=South Rim |date=1972 |publisher=US Government Printing Office |location=Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lodging====
Several lodging facilities are available along the South Rim. Hotels and other lodging include [[El Tovar Hotel|El Tovar]], [[Bright Angel Lodge]], Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and [[Maswik Lodge]], all of which are located in the village area, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor. There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by [[Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts]], while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by [[Delaware North]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GRCA South Rim Lodging&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/lodging.htm |title=Lodging |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the North Rim there is the historic [[Grand Canyon Lodge]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GRCA South Rim Lodging&quot; /&gt; managed by Forever Resorts and a campground near the lodge, managed by the national park staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRCA North Rim Lodging&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/cg-nr.htm |title=Campgrounds – North Rim |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Grand Canyon National Park has five climate zones; Cold Semi-Arid (''BSk''), Humid Continental Dry Cool Summer (''Dsb''), Humid Continental Dry Warm Summer (''Dsa''), Warm Summer Mediterranean (''Csb''), and Hot Summer Mediterranean (''Csa''). The [[plant hardiness zone]] at Grand Canyon Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 3.3&amp;nbsp;°F (−15.9&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx |title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |access-date=2019-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.

Many visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the [[Widforss Trail]], Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the [[North Kaibab Trail]]. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the [[South Kaibab Trail]] and the [[Bright Angel Trail]], which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.

The [[Toroweap Overlook]] is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off [[Arizona State Route 389|Route 389]] west of [[Fredonia, Arizona]]. The roads lead through [[Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument]] and to the overlook.

===South Rim===
[[File:A252, Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA, south rim, desert viewpoint, 2008.JPG|thumb|From Desert View on the South Rim]]
A variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour ({{convert|35|mi|km}}) along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the [[John Wesley Powell|Powell]] Memorial.&lt;ref name=SouthRim/&gt; From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is {{convert|25|mi|km}}, and is open to private vehicles year round.

Walking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} of paved road, followed by {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.

Private canyon flyovers are provided by [[helicopter]]s and [[Fixed-wing aircraft|small airplanes]] out of Las Vegas, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]]. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within {{convert|1500|ft|m}} of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taennyn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title14-vol2-part91-appFederal.pdf |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629175020/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2014-title14-vol2-part91-appFederal.pdf |archive-date=June 29, 2017 |access-date=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;HualapaiHelo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.grandcanyonwest.com/helicopter--aerial-tours.htm |title=Grand Canyon Helicopter &amp; Aerial Tours |last=Grand Canyon West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The U.S. government halted development of a 1.6 million acre area including the national park from 1966 to 2009, known as [[the Bennett Freeze]], because of an ownership dispute between Hopi and Navajo.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat09&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kate Linthicum |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/05/nation/na-bennett-freeze5 |title=Trying to be rebuild[sic] after 40 frozen years |date=November 5, 2009 |access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand Canyon Association==
{{main|Grand Canyon Association}}
The Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official [[nonprofit]] partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region.

In September 2016, Gordon Rugg and Gavin Taylor addressed these objections in another article in ''[[Cryptologia]]'', and illustrated a simple hoax method that they claim could have caused the mathematical properties of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon Rugg, Gavin Taylor|title=Hoaxing statistical features of the Voynich Manuscript|date=September 2016|doi=10.1080/01611194.2016.1206753|journal=Cryptologia|volume=41|issue=3|pages=247–268|s2cid=5848113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 Torsten Timm and Andreas Schinner published an algorithm that could have been used by a Medieval author to generate meaningless text which matches the statistical characteristics of the Voynich Manuscript &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Torsten Timm &amp; Andreas Schinner|title=A possible generating algorithm of the Voynich manuscript|date=May 2019|doi=10.1080/01611194.2019.1596999|journal=Cryptologia|volume=44|issue=1|pages=1–19|s2cid=181797693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glossolalia ===
[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|200px|Script invented by Hildegard von Bingen]]
[[File:Voynich-partof f78r.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Detail of the nymphs on page 141; ''f78r'']]
In their 2004 book, Gerry Kennedy and Rob Churchill suggest the possibility that the Voynich manuscript may be a case of [[glossolalia]] (speaking-in-tongues), [[Mediumship|channeling]], or [[outsider art]].&lt;ref name=KennedyChurchill2004&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2004|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which resembles [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]], either because of voices heard or because of an urge. This often takes place in an invented language in glossolalia, usually made up of fragments of the author's own language, although invented scripts for this purpose are rare.

Kennedy and Churchill use [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s works to point out similarities between the Voynich manuscript and the illustrations that she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of [[migraine]], which can induce a trance-like state prone to glossolalia. Prominent features found in both are abundant &quot;streams of stars&quot;, and the repetitive nature of the &quot;[[nymphs]]&quot; in the balneological section.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|Churchill|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been found unlikely by other researchers.&lt;ref name=PellingWeb&gt;{{cite web |author=Pelling, Nick |date=January 19, 2012 |title=Does the &quot;Voynich = migraine&quot; theory make your head hurt too? |url=http://ciphermysteries.com/2012/01/19/does-the-voynich-migraine-theory-make-your-head-hurt-too |access-date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory is virtually impossible to prove or disprove, short of deciphering the text. Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman), or else a forgery, as the preeminent theory. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is a genuine creation, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyChurchill2004&quot; /&gt;

== Decipherment claims ==
Since the manuscript's modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.

=== William Romaine Newbold ===
One of the earliest efforts to unlock the book's secrets (and the first of many premature claims of decipherment) was made in 1921 by [[William Romaine Newbold]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless itself, but that each apparent &quot;letter&quot; is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under [[magnification]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} These markings were supposed to be based on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[shorthand]], forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a [[compound microscope]] four hundred years before [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} A circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a [[telescope]].&lt;ref name=nsa /&gt; Similarly, he interpreted other drawings as [[cell (biology)|cells]] seen through a [[microscope]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

However, Newbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/newbold_wm_romaine.html |title=Penn Biographies – William Romaine Newbold (1865–1926) |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |date=September 6, 1926 |access-date=June 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419231850/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/newbold_wm_romaine.html |archive-date=April 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[John Matthews Manly]] of the [[University of Chicago]] pointed out serious flaws in his theory. Each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, with no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible [[Latin language|Latin]] was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the [[microscopic]] markings. Although evidence of [[micrography]] using the [[Hebrew language]] can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to [[pareidolia]]. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahn|1967|pp=867–869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Martin Feely ===
In 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published ''Roger Bacon's Cipher: The Right Key Found'', in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon. Feely's method posited that the text was a highly abbreviated medieval Latin written in a simple substitution cipher.&lt;ref name=enigma /&gt;

=== Leonell C. Strong ===
[[Leonell C. Strong]], a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, believed that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a &quot;peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet&quot;. Strong claimed that the [[plaintext]] revealed the Voynich manuscript to be written by the 16th-century English author [[Anthony Ascham (author)|Anthony Ascham]], whose works include ''A Little Herbal'', published in 1550. Notes released after his death reveal that the last stages of his analysis, in which he selected words to combine into phrases, were questionably subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2015|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert S. Brumbaugh ===
In 1978, [[Robert Brumbaugh]], a professor of medieval philosophy at Yale University, claimed that the manuscript was a forgery intended to fool Emperor Rudolf II into purchasing it, and that the text is Latin enciphered with a complex, two-step method.&lt;ref name=enigma /&gt;

=== John Stojko ===
In 1978, John Stojko published ''Letters to God's Eye'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stojko|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he claimed that the Voynich Manuscript was a series of letters written in vowelless Ukrainian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zandbergen solvers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Zandbergen, René |title=Voynich MS – History of research of the MS |url=http://www.voynich.nu/solvers.html |website=Voynich.nu |access-date=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory caused some sensation among the Ukrainian diaspora at the time, and then in independent Ukraine after 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Олена Русина. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24711694 До &quot;неможливих джерел&quot; вітчизняної історії: &quot;Рукопис Войнича&quot; в українському контексті] // Harvard Ukrainian Studies. – Vol. 32–33 (2011{{ndash}}2014). – Part 2. – pp. 611–618 (in Ukrainian).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the date Stojko gives for the letters, the lack of relation between the text and the images, and the general looseness in the method of decryption all speak against his theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zandbergen solvers&quot; /&gt;

=== Stephen Bax ===
In 2014, applied linguistics Professor Stephen Bax self-published a paper claiming to have translated ten words from the manuscript using techniques similar to those used to successfully translate [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bax2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bax |first1=Stephen |title=A proposed partial decoding of the Voynich script |date=January 2014 |url=http://stephenbax.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voynich-a-provisional-partial-decoding-BAX.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the manuscript to be a treatise on nature, in a Near Eastern or Asian language, but no full translation was made before Bax's death in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-26198471|title=Breakthrough over 600-year-old mystery manuscript|last=Rigby|first=Nic|date=18 February 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicholas Gibbs ===
In September 2017, television writer Nicholas Gibbs claimed to have decoded the manuscript as idiosyncratically abbreviated Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/voynich-manuscript-solution/ |title=Voynich manuscript: the solution |date=September 5, 2017 |first=Nicholas |last=Gibbs |website=The Times Literary Supplement |access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared the manuscript to be a mostly plagiarized guide to women's health.

Scholars judged Gibbs' hypothesis to be trite. His work was criticized as patching together already-existing scholarship with a highly speculative and incorrect translation; Lisa Fagin Davis, director of the [[Medieval Academy of America]], stated that Gibbs' decipherment &quot;doesn't result in Latin that makes sense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/experts-are-extremely-dubious-about-the-voynich-solution/ |title=So much for that Voynich manuscript &quot;solution&quot; |date=September 10, 2017 |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |work=Ars Technica |access-date=September 12, 2017 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/has-the-voynich-manuscript-really-been-solved/539310/ |title=Has a Mysterious Medieval Code Really Been Solved? |date=September 10, 2017 |last=Zhang |first=Sarah |work=The Atlantic |access-date=September 12, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greg Kondrak ===
Professor Greg Kondrak, a natural language processing expert at the [[University of Alberta]], together with his graduate student Bradley Hauer, used [[computational linguistics]] in an attempt to decode the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/artificial-intelligence-takes-crack-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-180967983/|title=Artificial Intelligence Takes a Crack at Decoding the Mysterious Voynich Manuscript|work=[[Smithsonian Mag]]|date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2017, in the form of an article suggesting that the language of the manuscript is most likely [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but encoded using alphagrams, i.e. alphabetically ordered [[anagram]]s. However, the team admitted that experts in medieval manuscripts who reviewed the work were not convinced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mysterious-manuscript-decoded-computer-scientists-ai-a8180951.html|title=Mysterious 15th century manuscript finally decoded 600 years later|date=2018-01-27|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hauer|first1=Bradley|last2=Kondrak|first2=Grzegorz|title=Decoding Anagrammed Texts Written in an Unknown Language and Script|url=https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/821|journal=Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics|volume=4|pages=75–86|doi=10.1162/tacl_a_00084|year=2016|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/computer-scientist-claims-clues-to-deciphering-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-2|title=Computer scientist claims clues to deciphering mysterious Voynich manuscript|newspaper=The National Post|date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is also disputed by an expert in the Hebrew language and its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2018/02/no-the-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-is-not-written-in-hebrew/|title=No, the Mysterious Voynich Manuscript Is Not Written in Hebrew|website=mosaicmagazine.com|access-date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ahmet Ardiç ===
In 2018, Ahmet Ardiç, an electrical engineer with a passion for researching Turkic languages, linguistics and etymological roots claimed the Voynich script is a kind of Old Turkic written in a ‘poetic’ style, that often displays ‘phonemic orthography’ meaning the author spelled out words the way he, or she, heard them. He claims to have deciphered and translated over 30% of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Books|first1=in|last2=February 21st|first2=History {{!}}|last3=Comments|first3=2019 23|title=Has the Voynich Manuscript Finally Been Decoded?: Researchers Claim That the Mysterious Text Was Written in Phonetic Old Turkish|url=http://www.openculture.com/2019/02/has-the-voynich-manuscript-finally-been-decoded.html|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Open Culture|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Jane |last=Bracher |title=Will mystery of the medieval Voynich Manuscript ever be solved?|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/health/voynich-manuscript-mystery/index.html|access-date=2020-07-14|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardiç published a YouTube video detailing his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=Feb 22, 2018|title=Voynich Manuscript Revealed (2018)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6keMgLmFEk|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; His submission to the Digital Philology journal of Johns Hopkins University was rejected in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=Aug 1, 2019|title=Voynich Manuscript: Update and Q&amp;A|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTTRsrzndTY|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=As with most would-be Voynich interpreters, the logic of this proposal is circular and aspirational: he starts with a theory about what a particular series of glyphs might mean, usually because of the word's proximity to an image that he believes he can interpret. He then investigates any number of medieval Romance-language dictionaries until he finds a word that seems to suit his theory. Then he argues that because he has found a Romance-language word that fits his hypothesis, his hypothesis must be right. His &quot;translations&quot; from what is essentially gibberish, an amalgam of multiple languages, are themselves aspirational rather than being actual translations.

== Facsimile ==
Many books and articles have been written about the manuscript. Copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist Georgius Barschius in 1637 and sent to Athanasius Kircher, and later by Wilfrid Voynich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Clemens|editor1-first=Raymond|title=The Voynich Manuscript|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21723-0|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] made high-resolution digital scans publicly available online, and several printed facsimiles appeared.

The first documented settlements in the area of the present-day Province of Ferrara date from the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Alexander John|title=Colony and mother city in ancient Greece|date=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719057396|page=6|edition=Special}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] town of [[Spina]], established along the [[lagoon]]s at the ancient mouth of [[Po river]], were lost until modern times, when drainage schemes in the [[Valli di Comacchio]] marshes in 1922 first officially revealed a necropolis with over 4,000 tombs, evidence of a population centre that in Antiquity must have played a major role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-link=Jean MacIntosh Turfa|editor-last1=Turfa|editor-first1=Jean MacIntosh|title=The Etruscan world|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415673082|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is uncertainty among scholars about the proposed [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin of the settlement in its current location ([[Tacitus]] and [[Boccaccio]] refer to a &quot;Forum Alieni&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frizzi |first1=Antonio |title=Memorie Per La Storia Di Ferrara |volume=Vol. 1 |date=2012 |publisher=Nabu Press |location=Florence |isbn=9781274747815 |page=181 |orig-year=1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), for little is known of this period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenico&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Domenico |first1=Roy Palmer |title=The regions of Italy : a reference guide to history and culture |date=2002 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0313307331 |page=85 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some archeologic evidence points to the hypothesis that Ferrara could have been originated from two small [[Byzantine]] settlements: a cluster of facilities around the Cathedral of St. George, on the right bank of the main branch of the Po, which then ran much closer to the city than today, and a [[castra|castrum]], a fortified complex built on the left bank of the river to defend against the Lombards.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCI&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Ferrara and its province|date=2005|publisher=[[Touring Club Italiano|Touring Club of Italy]]|location=Milan|isbn=9788836534401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrara appears first in a document of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Desiderius]] of 753 AD, when he captured the town from the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrara, Italy |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ferrara-Italy |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=13 December 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the [[Franks]], after routing the Lombards, presented Ferrara to the [[Papacy]] in 754 or 756.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenico&quot;/&gt;  In 988 Ferrara was ceded by the Church to the [[House of Canossa]], but at the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany]] in 1115 it became a [[Medieval commune|free commune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCI&quot;/&gt; During the 12th century the history of the town was marked by the wrestling for power between two preeminent families, the [[Guelphs|Guelph]] Adelardi and the [[Ghibelline]] Salinguerra; however, at this point, the powerful Imperial [[House of Este]] had thrown his decisive weight behind the Salinguerra and eventually reaped the benefits of victory for themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCI&quot;/&gt; In 1264 [[Obizzo II d'Este|Obizzo II of Este]] was thus proclaimed lifelong ruler of Ferrara, Lord of [[Modena]] in 1288 and of [[Reggio Nell Emilia|Reggio]] in 1289. His rule marked the end of the communal period in Ferrara and the beginning of the Este rule, which lasted until 1598.

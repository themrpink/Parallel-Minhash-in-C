Legal defenses like the [[gay panic defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. In several [[common law countries]], the mitigatory defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led several [[Australia]]n states and territories to modify their legislation, in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non-violent homosexual advances.

There have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against LGBT people have received shorter sentences. One such case is that of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reasonable&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=https://archive.org/details/murderreasonable0000leec |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/murderreasonable0000leec/page/91 91]|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC&quot;/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC&quot;/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[LGBT rights in Texas|Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: &quot;I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[LGBT rights in Florida|Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, &quot;That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?&quot;  The prosecutor responded, &quot;Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them.&quot;  &quot;Times have really changed,&quot; the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALTS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;/&gt;

===Attacks on gay pride parades===

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] in East European, Asian and South American countries often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[LGBT rights in Moldova|Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like &quot;let's get them out and beat them up&quot;, and &quot;beat them to death, don't let them escape&quot; at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028012532/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|archive-date=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]]'s officials are similarly averse to [[LGBT culture in Russia|Pride Parades]]. [[Mayor of Moscow]] [[Yury Luzhkov]] has repeatedly banned marches, calling them &quot;[[satan]]ic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Doug|title=Moscow Pride Banned Again|publisher=UK Gay News|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/May/3107.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181750/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/08/may/3107.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the [[right of assembly]] and [[Freedom of speech by country#Russia|freedom of expression]]. They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, &quot;No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here.&quot; When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202073400/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|archive-date=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT rights in Hungary|Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest Pride|Budapest Dignity March]]. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|newspaper=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014221138/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F6%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archive-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle &quot;the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145651/http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|archive-date=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], three marchers in a [[Jerusalem gay pride parade|gay pride parade in Jerusalem]] on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by [[Yishai Shlisel]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]. Shlisel claimed he had acted &quot;in the name of God&quot;. He was charged with attempted murder.Ten years later, On 30 July 2015, [[Jerusalem gay pride parade#2015 attack|six marchers were injured]], again by [[Yishai Shlisel]] when he stabbed them. It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding &quot;We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law.&quot;

In 2019, the gay pride parade in [[Detroit]] was infiltrated by armed [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]] who reportedly claimed they wanted to spark &quot;Charlottesville 2.0&quot; referring to the [[Unite the Right rally|United the Right]] demonstration in 2017 which resulted in the murder of [[Charlottesville car attack|Heather Heyer]], and many others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/06/10/detroit-chief-nazis-wanted-charlottesville-no-2-detroit-gay-pride-event/1410945001/|title=Detroit chief: Nazis wanted 'Charlottesville 2.0' at Detroit gay pride event|last=Hunter|first=George|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Christopher Street Day Berlin 2019 27.jpg|thumb|Marcher in 2019 [[Christopher Street Day]] 2019 march holding up Solidarity sign with Poland, following [[Białystok]] attack]]

===Advocacy in song lyrics===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Buju Banton]], a Jamaican musician, performing in 2007.]]
As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since appeared to reform.

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot;. The song is about murdering homosexuals and &quot;advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freemuse&quot; /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: &quot;When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;belfast&quot; /&gt;

Canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] has investigated reggae [[lyrics]] and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[United Kingdom]] in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;freemuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise &quot;not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs.&quot; Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;freemuse&quot; /&gt; but some later denied signing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;belfast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008|access-date=November 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102014318/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html/|archive-date=January 2, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and [[Racism in North America|racist]] rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts with anti-gay music advocating violence.

==Motivations==
===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{Original research section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Homophobia}}
{{see also|Hypermasculinity|Compulsory heterosexuality}}

The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.
Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title=Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] &quot;male&quot;, such as [[association football|football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change|title=Fans' culture hard to change|accessdate=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexuals in a [[heteronormative]] culture,&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Karen |date=April 2004 |title=Enacting Masculinity: Antigay Violence and Group Rape as Participatory Theater |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227284300 |journal=[[Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy]] |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=25–40 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.25 |s2cid=143439942 |via=[[ResearchGate]] |access-date=8 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin 2004&quot;/&gt;

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes [[Sexual repression|repression]], denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.''

====Religious texts====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=May 2016}}
Some verses of the [[Bible and violence|Bible]] are often interpreted as forbidding homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]].|[[Leviticus 18]]:22}}

{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|[[Kedoshim|Leviticus 20]]:13}}

The above verses are the cause of tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

In the ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to &quot;abusive sex.&quot; She states that the Bible has no condemnation for &quot;loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships&quot; and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The &quot;Gay&quot; Princess Di Bible|author=Candace Chellew-Hodge|work=Religion Dispatches|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church teaches]] that a homosexual orientation is not sinful and that LGBT people are to be treated with compassion and respect, as all others are.  It also [[theology of the body|teaches that sex]] is meant to be had between opposite sex spouses.  A 1992 letter from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the future Pope Benedict XVI, condemned [[gay bashing]].&lt;ref name=reltol/&gt;  It said that LGBT people &quot;have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity.&quot;&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  It adds that 
 	
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;&lt;ref name=assumption/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the same letter Ratzinger suggested that an increase in anti-gay violence is unsurprising if laws are introduced to protect homosexual behavior:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI#Homosexuality and LGBT rights|Pope Benedict XVI]], then the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stated that &quot;protecting&quot; humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a &quot;destruction of God's work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pope&quot; /&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2018}} [[Pope Francis]] has been seen as [[Pastoral care for gay Catholics|more welcoming to LGBT people]], saying to a gay man that &quot;God made you like this.

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Quran and violence|Quran]] cites the story of the &quot;people of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]]&quot; (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] carnal acts between men.

[[Islam#Scholars|Scholars of Islam]], such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fatwa IslamOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603002449/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|archive-date=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for [[Islamic views on anal sex|sodomy]] has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]] and forbidden in most [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority countries]]. In some relatively [[Islam and secularism|secular]] Muslim-majority countries such as [[LGBT rights in Indonesia|Indonesia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RoughGuideSEAsia2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetosout00vari/page/74 74]|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetosout00vari/page/74|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Jordan|Jordan]] and [[LGBT rights in Turkey|Turkey]], this is not the case.

The [[Quran]], much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Sunnah]] (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: &quot;Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fatwa IslamOnline&quot;/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|title=Homosexuality prohibited in Submission (Islam)|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[imam]]s still preach their views, stating that homosexuals and &quot;women who act like men&quot; should be executed under the Islamic law. Abu Usamah at [[Green Lane Masjid|Green Lane Mosque]] in [[Religion in Birmingham#Islam|Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying &quot;If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be executed, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pinknews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122134804/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|archive-date=November 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary Islamic views are that the &quot;crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes, the worst of [[Sin#Islam|sins]] and the most abhorrent of deeds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622/ The punishment for homosexuality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921163324/http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622 |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;br /&gt;Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 38622&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is considered the 11th major sin in Islam, in the days of the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], a [[Islamic views on slavery|slave]] boy was once forgiven for killing his master who sodomized him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/greater-sins-volume-1-ayatullah-sayyid-abdul-husayn-dastghaib-shirazi/eleventh-greater-sin-sodomy|title=Eleventh Greater sin: Sodomy|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism|death penalty]] against homosexuality has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] [[Homosexuality and Judaism#Orthodox Jewish views|generally prohibits homosexual conduct]]. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including [[Sodomy#Judaism|sodomy]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;&quot;die rather than transgress&quot;&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]], [[Idolatry in Judaism|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery#In Judaism|adultery]], and [[Jewish views on incest|incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.

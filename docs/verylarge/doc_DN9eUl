===New classical macroeconomics===
While general equilibrium theory and neoclassical economics generally were originally microeconomic theories, [[new classical macroeconomics]] builds a macroeconomic theory on these bases. In new classical models, the macroeconomy is assumed to be at its unique equilibrium, with full employment and potential output, and that this equilibrium is assumed to always have been achieved via price and wage adjustment (market clearing). The best-known such model is [[real business-cycle theory]], in which [[business cycle]]s are considered to be largely due to changes in the real economy, unemployment is not due to the failure of the market to achieve potential output, but due to equilibrium potential output having fallen and equilibrium unemployment having risen.

===Socialist economics===
Within [[socialist economics]], a sustained critique of general equilibrium theory (and neoclassical economics generally) is given in ''Anti-Equilibrium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kornai |first=János |title=Anti-Equilibrium: On Economic Systems Theory and the Tasks of Research |url=https://archive.org/details/antiequilibriumo0000korn |url-access=registration |location=Amsterdam |publisher=North-Holland |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-7204-3055-4 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the experiences of [[János Kornai]] with the failures of Communist [[central planning]], although [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]] later based their [[Parecon]] model on the same theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Albert |first=Michael |first2=Robin|last2=Hahnel |title=The Political Economy of Participatory Economics |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1991 |pages=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other electronic color display technologies ([[LCD]], [[Plasma display]], [[OLED]]) have analogous sets of primaries with different emission spectra.]]

A set of '''primary colors''' is a set of [[colorant]]s or colored lights that can be combined in varying amounts to produce a [[gamut]] of colors. This is the essential method used in applications that are intended to elicit the perception of diverse sets of color, e.g. electronic displays, color printing, and paintings. Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors are predicted by applying the appropriate mixing model ([[additive mixing|additive]], [[subtractive mixing|subtractive]], additive averaging, etc.) that embodies the underlying physics of how light interacts with the media and ultimately the retina.

Primary colors can be conceptual (not necessarily real colors), either as additive mathematical elements of a [[color space]] or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and [[Philosophy of color|philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Sets of color-space primaries are generally somewhat ''arbitrary'', in the sense that there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set. Primary pigments or light sources are selected for a given application on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost, stability, availability etc.

== Additive mixing of light ==

[[File:LCD pixels RGB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A photograph of the red, green, and blue elements (subpixels) of an [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]].  Additive mixing explains how light from these colored elements can be used for photorealistic color image reproduction.]]

The perception elicited by multiple light sources co-stimulating the same area of the retina is additive, i.e., predicted via summing the [[spectral power distribution]]s or tristimulus values of the individual light sources (assuming a color matching context). For example, a purple spotlight on a dark background could be matched with coincident blue and red spotlights that are both dimmer than the purple spotlight. If the intensity of the purple spotlight was doubled it could be matched by doubling the intensities of both the red and blue spotlights that matched the original purple.  The principles of additive color mixing are embodied in [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the [[CIE 1931]] colorspace. The original ''[[monochromatic]]'' primaries of the wavelengths of 435.8&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), 546.1&amp;nbsp;nm (green), and 700&amp;nbsp;nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Guild approached the problem from the viewpoint of a standardization engineer. In his mind, the adopted primaries had to be producible with national-standardizing-laboratory accuracy. The first two wavelengths were mercury excitation lines, and the last named wavelength occurred at a location in the human vision system where the hue of spectral lights was unchanging with wavelength. Slight inaccuracy in production of the wavelength of this spectral primary in a visual colorimeter, it was reasoned, would introduce no error at all.&quot;

[[Red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] light are popular primaries for additive color mixing since primary lights with those hues provide a large triangular chromaticity gamut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairchild |first1=Mark |title=Why Is Color - Short Answers - Q: Why are red, blue, and green considered the primary colors? |url=http://rit-mcsl.org/fairchild/WhyIsColor/shortAs.html |website=Color Curiosity Shop |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small red, green, and blue elements in electronic displays mix additively from an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The exact colors chosen for additive primaries are a technological compromise between the available [[phosphor]]s (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large chromaticity gamut. The [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709-5]]/[[sRGB]] primaries are typical.

It is important to note that additive mixing provides very poor predictions of color perception outside the color matching context.  Well known demonstrations such as [[The dress]] and other examples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; show how the additive mixing model alone is not sufficient for predicting perceived color in many instances of real images. In general, we cannot completely predict all possible perceived colors from combinations of primary lights in the context of real-world images and viewing conditions.  The cited examples suggest just how remarkably poor such predictions can be.

== Subtractive mixing of ink layers ==

{{See also|CMYK color model}}
[[File:Halftoningcolor.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|A magnified representation of small partially overlapping spots of cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) [[halftone]]s in [[CMYK]] process printing.  Each row represents the pattern of partially overlapping ink &quot;rosettes&quot; so that the patterns would be perceived as blue, green, and red when viewed on white paper from a typical viewing distance. The overlapping ink layers mix subtractively while additive mixing predicts the color appearance from the light reflected from the rosettes and white paper in between them.]]

The [[subtractive color]] mixing model predicts the resultant spectral power distribution of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials on a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through, resulting in a colored appearance. The resultant spectral power distribution is predicted by sequentially taking the product of the spectral power distributions of the incoming light and transmissivity at each filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levoy |first1=Marc |title=Additive versus subtractive color mixing |url=https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs178-10/applets/colormixing.html |website=graphics.stanford.edu |accessdate=4 November 2020 |quote=&quot;On the other hand, if you reflect light from a colored surface, or if you place a colored filter in front of a light, then some of the wavelengths present in the light may be partially or fully absorbed by the colored surface or filter. If we characterize the light as an SPD, and we characterize absorption by the surface or filter using a spectrum of reflectivity or transmissivity, respectively, i.e. the percentage of light reflected or transmitted at each wavelength, then the SPD of the outgoing light can be computed by multiplying the two spectra. This multiplication is (misleadingly) called subtractive mixing.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper in this way to generate photorealistic color images.  The typical number of inks in such a printing process ranges from 3 to 6 (e.g., [[CMYK]] process, [[hexachrome|Pantone hexachrome]]). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more may result in better color reproduction.

[[Cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] are good subtractive primaries in that idealized filters with those hues can be overlaid to yield the largest chromaticity gamuts of reflected light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The color of light (i.e., the spectral power distribution) reflected from illuminated surfaces coated in paint mixes, slurries of pigment particles, is not well approximated by a subtractive or additive mixing model.

== Color-space primaries ==
A contemporary description of the [[color vision]] system provides an understanding of primary colors that is consistent with modern [[color science]]. The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) [[cone cell]]s. The response of these photoreceptor types varies across wavelengths of the visible electromagnetic spectrum. The S cone response is generally assumed to be negligible at long wavelengths greater than about 560&amp;nbsp;nm, while the L and M cones respond across the entire visible spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockmansharpe2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LMS primaries are imaginary since there is no visible wavelength that stimulates only one type of cone (i.e., humans cannot normally see a color that corresponds to pure L, M or S stimulation). The LMS primaries are complete since every visible color can be mapped to a triplet specifying the coordinates in [[LMS color space]].

[[File:Normalized Cone Sensitivities.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Normalized cone [[spectral sensitivity]] curves]]

The L, M and S response curves (''cone fundamentals'') were deduced from ''color matching functions'' obtained from controlled color matching experiments (e.g., [[CIE 1931]]) where observers matched the color of a surface illuminated by monochromatic light with mixtures of three monochromatic primary lights illuminating a juxtaposed surface. Practical applications generally use a canonical linear transformation of LMS space known as [[CIEXYZ]]. The X, Y, and Z primaries are typically more useful since luminance (Y) is specified separately from a color's chromaticity.  Any color space primaries which can be mapped to physiologically relevant LMS primaries by a linear transformation are necessarily either imaginary or incomplete or both. The color-matching context is always three dimensional (since LMS space is three dimensional) but more general ''color appearance'' models like [[CIECAM02]] describe color in six dimensions and can be used to predict how colors appear under different viewing conditions.

Humans are trichromats and use three (or more) primaries for many applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two primaries would be unable to produce even some of the most common among the named colors. Adding a reasonable choice of the third primary can drastically increase the available gamut, while adding a fourth or fifth may increase the gamut but typically not by as much.

Most [[placental mammal]]s other than primates have only two types of color photoreceptor and are, therefore [[dichromacy|dichromats]], so it is possible that certain combinations of just two primaries might cover some significant gamut relative to the range of their color perception.  Meanwhile, [[birds]] and [[marsupials]] have four color photoreceptors in their eyes, and hence are [[tetrachromats]]. There is one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The presence of photoreceptor cell types in an organism's eyes do not directly imply that they are being used to functionally perceive color. Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging due to the difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who cannot respond using language. Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Main|Opponent process}}

The [[opponent process]] is a color theory that states that the human [[visual system]] interprets information about [[color]] by processing signals from [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] in an antagonistic manner.  The theory states that every color can be described as a mix along the three axes of red vs. green, blue vs. yellow and white vs. black.  The six colors from the pairs might be called &quot;psychological primary colors&quot; because any other color could be described in terms of some combination of these pairs.

This tenet was long maintained in the absence of neurophysiological evidence, and continues to be maintained even though current neurophysiological evidence does not support it.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three axes of the psychological primaries were applied by [[Richard S. Hunter]] as the primaries for the colorspace ultimately known as [[CIELAB]].  The [[Natural Color System]] is also directly inspired by the psychological primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

But at the present day, when purple is employed for colouring walls even, and when India sends to us the slime of her rivers, and the corrupt blood of her dragons and her elephants, there is no such thing as a picture of high quality produced.

The '''swastika''' symbol, 卐 (''right-facing'' or ''clockwise'') or 卍 (''left-facing'' or ''counterclockwise''), is an ancient [[religious icon]] in the cultures of [[Eurasia]]. The left-facing version may also be referred to as [[sauwastika]]. It is used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in [[Indian religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sullivan2001p216&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snodgrass82&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cort 2001 17&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cort |first=John E. |author-link=John E.

In the [[Western world]], it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck until the 1930s&lt;ref name=bbcmag/&gt; when the right-facing tilted form became a feature of [[Nazi symbolism]] as an emblem of the [[Aryan race]]. As a result of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], many people in the West still strongly associate it with [[Nazism]] and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;holocaust2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiener463&quot; /&gt; The swastika continues to be used as a symbol of good luck and prosperity in Hindu and Buddhist countries such as Nepal, India, Mongolia, China and Japan. It is also commonly used in Hindu marriage ceremonies.

The word ''swastika'' comes from {{lang-sa|[[wikt:स्वस्तिक#Sanskrit|स्वस्तिक]]|svástika}}, meaning 'conducive to well-being'.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britswast&quot;&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/swastika Swastika: SYMBOL], Encyclopædia Britannica (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hinduism]], the right-facing symbol (卐) is called {{lang|sa-Latn|swastika}}, symbolizing {{lang|sa-Latn|[[surya]]}} ('sun'), prosperity and good luck, while the left-facing symbol (卍) is called {{lang|sa-Latn|[[sauvastika]]}}, symbolizing night or [[Tantra|tantric]] aspects of [[Kali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britswast&quot; /&gt; In [[Jainism]], a swastika is the symbol for [[Suparshvanatha]] – the seventh of 24 [[Tirthankara]]s ([[spiritual teacher]]s and [[Salvation|saviours]]), while in [[Buddhism]] it symbolizes the auspicious footprints of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britswast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;silverblatt109&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mohan |last1=Pant |first2=Shūji |last2=Funo |title=Stupa and Swastika: Historical Urban Planning Principles in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W-K5_Z8qsJEC |date=2007 |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |isbn=978-9971-69-372-5 |page=231 with note 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several major [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] religions, the swastika symbolizes lightning bolts, representing the [[thunder god]] and the [[king of the gods]], such as [[Indra]] in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Hinduism]], [[Zeus]] in the [[ancient Greek religion]], [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and [[Thor]] in the [[Germanic mythology|ancient Germanic religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greg |first1=Robert Philips |title=On the Meaning and Origin of the Fylfot and Swastika |url=https://archive.org/details/onmeaningandori00londgoog |date=1884 |publisher=Nichols and Sons |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onmeaningandori00londgoog/page/n11 6], 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swastika is an icon which is widely found in both human history and the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.97&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britswast&quot; /&gt; In various forms, it is otherwise known (in various European languages) as the ''[[fylfot]]'', ''gammadion'', ''tetraskelion'', or ''cross cramponnée'' (a term in Anglo-Norman [[heraldry]]); [[German Language|German]]: {{lang|de|Hakenkreuz}}; [[French Language|French]]: {{lang|fr|croix gammée}}; [[Italian Language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|croce uncinata}}. In [[Mongolian Language|Mongolian]] it is called Хас (''khas'') and mainly used in seals. In [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] it is called 萬字 (''wànzì'') meaning 'all things symbol', pronounced ''manji'' in [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] and ''manja'' (만자) in [[Korean Language|Korean]]. A swastika generally takes the form of a [[cross]], the arms of which are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms, each bent midway at a right angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;MigSym&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CambDict&quot; /&gt; The symbol is found in the archeological remains of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Faience button seal | url= https://www.harappa.com/indus4/45.html | quote= Faience button seal (H99-3814/8756-01) with swastika motif found on the floor of Room 202 (Trench 43).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samarra culture|Samarra]], as well as in early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]work.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.97&quot; /&gt;

The right-facing swastika (卐) was [[Western use of the swastika in the early 20th century|adopted by several organizations in pre–World War I Europe]], and later by the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Nazi Germany]] before [[World War II]]. It was used by the Nazi Party to symbolize German [[Nationalism|nationalistic pride]]. To Jews and other victims and enemies of Nazi Germany, it became a symbol of antisemitism and terror.&lt;ref name=&quot;holocaust2009&quot; /&gt; In many Western countries, the swastika is now viewed as a symbol of [[racial supremacism]] and intimidation because of its association with [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wiener463&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boissoneaultsm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot; /&gt;

In Hindu and Buddhist cultures, the swastika is a holy symbol. On the holiday of [[Divali]], Hindu households commonly use the swastika in decorations. Many [[India]]n auto-rickshaws feature the swastika to ward off ill-fortune. Reverence for the swastika symbol in Asian cultures, in contrast to the West's stigmatization of the symbol, has led to misinterpretations and misunderstandings.&lt;ref name=bbcmag&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29644591|title=How the world loved the swastika – until Hitler stole it |first=Mukti Jain |last=Campion |date=23 October 2014 |magazine=[[BBC News Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pokémon cards&quot; /&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
[[File:Snoldelevsunwheel.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a swastika on the [[Snoldelev Stone]] (9th century)]]
The word {{lang|sa-Latn|swastika}} is derived from the Sanskrit {{lang|sa-Latn|swasti}}, which is composed of
{{lang|sa-Latn|Su}} (सु – good, well, auspicious) and {{lang|sa-Latn|Asti}} (अस्ति – &quot;it is” or &quot;there is&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schliemann347&quot; /&gt;)

The word ''swastika'' has been used in the [[Vedas|Indian subcontinent]] since 500 BCE. The word was first recorded by the ancient linguist [[Pāṇini]] in his work ''Ashtadhyayi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmer |first1=Heinrich |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |year=2017 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alternatively spelled in contemporary texts as ''svastika'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=F. R. |last1=Allchin |first2=George |last2=Erdosy |title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C&amp;pg=PA180 |date=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-37695-2 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other spellings were occasionally used in the 19th and early 20th century, such as ''suastika''.&lt;ref&gt;First recorded 1871 ([[OED]]); alternative historical English spellings include ''suastika'', ''swastica'', and ''svastica''; see, for example: {{cite book |title=Notes and Queries|issue= 170|date= 31 March 1883 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA259 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the [[Sanskrit]] term ([[Devanagari]] {{lang|sa|[[wikt:स्वस्तिक|स्वस्तिक]]}}), which transliterates to ''{{IAST|svastika}}'' under the commonly used IAST transliteration system, but is pronounced closer to ''swastika'' when letters are used with their English values. An important early use of the word swastika in a European text was in 1871 with the publications of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who discovered more than 1,800 ancient samples of the swastika symbol and its variants while digging the [[Hisarlik]] mound near the Aegean Sea coast for the history of Troy. Schliemann linked his findings to the Sanskrit {{lang|sa-Latn|swastika}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boissoneaultsm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Douglas |last=Harper |date=2016 |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=swastika |title=Swastika |work=Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Mees|2008|pp=57–58}}

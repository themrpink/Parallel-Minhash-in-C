Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending [[application software|software applications]] to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities of most [[procedural programming]] languages, but more complicated or [[domain-specific language|domain-specific]] features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its [[Profiling (computer programming)|speed]], [[Portability (computer science)|portability]], extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.

== History ==

Lua was created in 1993 by [[Roberto Ierusalimschy]], Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Brazil]].

From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong [[trade barrier]]s (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software. In that atmosphere, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch.&lt;ref name=hopl2007&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R.| author1-link = Roberto Ierusalimschy| last2 = Figueiredo| first2 = L. H. | last3 = Celes| first3 = W.| contribution = The evolution of Lua| contribution-url = https://www.lua.org/doc/hopl.pdf| doi = 10.1145/1238844.1238846| title = Proc. of ACM HOPL III| url = https://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/hopl| year = 2007| pages = 2–1–2–26| isbn = 978-1-59593-766-7| s2cid = 475143}}{{dead link |date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lua's predecessors were the data-description/configuration languages ''SOL'' (Simple Object Language) and ''DEL'' (data-entry language).&lt;ref name=&quot;luahist2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/history.html|title=The evolution of an extension language: a history of Lua|year=2001|accessdate=2008-12-18}}
&lt;!-- {{cite journal| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R. | author1-link = Roberto Ierusalimschy| last2 = Figueiredo | first2 = L. H.| last3 = Celes | first3 = W. | contribution = The evolution of an extension language: a history of Lua| contribution-url = https://www.lua.org/history.html| title = Proc. of V Brazilian Symposium on Prog. Lang.| year = 2001| pages = B–14–B–28}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They had been independently developed at Tecgraf in 1992–1993 to add some flexibility into two different projects (both were interactive graphical programs for engineering applications at [[Petrobras]] company). There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them.

In ''The Evolution of Lua'', the language's authors wrote:&lt;ref name=hopl2007 /&gt;

{{Quote|In 1993, the only real contender was [[Tcl]], which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] or [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] because of their unfriendly syntax. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language&amp;nbsp;... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.}}

Lua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: ''Sol'' is also the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese word]] for &quot;Sun&quot;, ''Lua'' being the word for &quot;Moon&quot;). Lua [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] for control structures was mostly borrowed from [[Modula]] (&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt;), but also had taken influence from [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to [[Call by reference|reference parameters]] or explicit [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]), [[C++]] (&quot;neat idea of allowing a [[local variable]] to be declared only where we need it&quot;&lt;ref name=hopl2007 /&gt;), [[SNOBOL]] and [[AWK]] ([[associative array]]s). In an article published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', Lua's creators also state that [[LISP]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the [[List (computing)|list]]) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.&lt;ref name=ddj96&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = L. H. | last2 = Ierusalimschy | first2 = R. | last3 = Celes| first3 = W. | title = Lua: an Extensible Embedded Language. A few metamechanisms replace a host of features| magazine = Dr. Dobb's Journal| volume = 21| issue = 12| pages = 26–33| date = December 1996| url = https://www.lua.org/ddj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lua [[semantics]] have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time,&lt;ref name=hopl2007 /&gt; especially with the introduction of [[anonymous function]]s and full [[Scope (computer science)#Lexical scope vs. dynamic scope|lexical scoping]]. Several features were added in new Lua versions.

Versions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the [[MIT License]].  Both are [[permissive free software licences]] and are almost identical.

== Features ==

Lua is commonly described as a &quot;[[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]&quot; language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], but allows it to be implemented with [[metatable]]s. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement [[namespaces]], [[Class (computer science)|classes]], and other related features using its single table implementation; [[first-class function]]s allow the employment of many techniques from [[functional programming]]; and full lexical [[Scope (programming)|scoping]] allows fine-grained [[information hiding]] to enforce the [[principle of least privilege]].

In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible [[Metaprogramming|meta-features]] that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is [[Lightweight programming language|light]]—the full reference [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] is only about 247&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] compiled&lt;ref name=luaabout /&gt;—and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.

Lua is a [[dynamically typed]] language intended for use as an [[Scripting language|extension]] or [[scripting language]] and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, numbers (double-precision [[floating point]] and 64-bit [[integers]] by default), and [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Typical data structures such as [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[List (computing)|lists]], and [[record (computer science)|records]] can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous [[associative array]].

Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as [[first-class function]]s, [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], proper [[Tail recursion|tail calls]], [[Type conversion|coercion]] (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [[coroutine]]s (cooperative multitasking) and [[Dynamic loading|dynamic module loading]].

=== Syntax ===

The classic [[&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program]] can be written as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html | title=Programming in Lua : 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
or as:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
print 'Hello World!'
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] in Lua starts with a double-[[hyphen]] and runs to the end of the line, similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[SQL]] and [[VHDL]]. Multi-line strings and comments are adorned with double square brackets.

The [[factorial]] function is implemented as a function in this example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
function factorial(n)
  local x = 1
  for i = 2, n do
    x = x * i
  end
  return x
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Control flow ===

Lua has four types of [[loop (computing)|loops]]: the [[while loop|&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop]], the &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; loop (similar to a [[do while loop|&lt;code&gt; do while&lt;/code&gt; loop]]), the numeric [[for loop|&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop]], and the generic &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lua&quot;&gt;
--condition = true

while condition do
  --statements
end

repeat
  --statements
until condition

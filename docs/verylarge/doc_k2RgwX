Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are [[Predation|predators]]: ''[[Spalgis epius]]'' eats [[scale insect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Venkatesha, M.

[[File:Four-horned Sphinx (Elm Sphinx).jpg|thumb|[[Camouflage|Cryptic]] [[countershading|countershaded]] caterpillar of a hawkmoth, ''[[Ceratomia amyntor]]'']]

Caterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as [[instar]]s. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called [[apolysis]], mediated by the release of a series of [[neurohormone]]s. During this phase, the [[cuticle]], a tough outer layer made of a mixture of [[chitin]] and specialized [[protein]]s, is released from the softer [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]] beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva [[ecdysis|moults]], the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment.&lt;ref name=Klowden&gt;{{cite book |author=Klowden, Marc J. |title=Physiological Systems in Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CABp1YL0F8gC&amp;pg=PA114 |year=2013 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-415970-9 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.

Caterpillars have short antennae and several [[Simple eye in invertebrates|simple eyes]]. The [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles and a pair of maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt; Caterpillars such as those in the genus ''[[Calpodes]]'' (family Hesperiidae) have a specialized tracheal system on the 8th segment that function as a primitive lung.&lt;ref name=&quot;Locke 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Michael | title=Caterpillars have evolved lungs for hemocyte gas exchange | journal=Journal of Insect Physiology | volume=44 | issue=1 | year=1997 | doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(97)00088-7 | pmid=12770439 | pages=1–20 |url=https://www.academia.edu/33633960/Caterpillars_have_evolved_lungs_for_hemocyte_gas_exchange&lt;!--full text, unlike DOI--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of [[proleg]]s arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naturemuseum.org/online/thebutterflylab/anatomy/larva.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319072020/http://www.naturemuseum.org/online/thebutterflylab/anatomy/larva.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 | title=Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum | publisher=Chicago Academy of Sciences | work=Larva Legs | access-date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis bears tufts of [[seta]]e, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration in the form of hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the [[gonad]]s start development in the egg stage.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

====Pupa====
[[File:Chrysalis5504.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chrysalis]] of [[gulf fritillary]]]]

When the larva is fully grown, hormones such as [[prothoracicotropic hormone]] (PTTH) are produced. At this point the larva stops feeding, and begins &quot;wandering&quot; in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position.&lt;ref name=Capinera640/&gt; Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.&lt;ref name=Formfunction&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/animal/lepidopteran/Form-and-function |title=Lepidopteran: Form and function |author=Culin, Joseph |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pupal transformation into a butterfly through [[metamorphosis]] has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11676917&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunetti, Craig R. |author2=Selegue, Jayne E. |author3=Monteiro, Antonia |author4=French, Vernon |author5=Brakefield, Paul M. |author6=Carroll, Sean B. |year=2001 |title=The Generation and Diversification of Butterfly Eyespot Color Patterns |journal=Current Biology |volume=11 |issue=20 |pages=1578–1585 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00502-4 |pmid=11676917|s2cid=14290399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adult====
The reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or [[imago]]. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single [[Epidermis|epidermal]] cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large [[Eye#Compound eyes|compound eyes]]. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but cannot view distant objects clearly. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the [[mandible]]s are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular [[proboscis]] which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

Many ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies also use their proboscis to feed on pollen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 25958827|year = 2015|last1 = Harpel|first1 = D.|title = Pollen feeding proteomics: Salivary proteins of the passion flower butterfly, Heliconius melpomene|journal = Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume = 63|pages = 7–13|last2 = Cullen|first2 = D.

The thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among [[Nymphalidae|nymphalids]], the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together ([[Wing coupling (Lepidoptera anatomy)|as they are in moths]]) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s which are used in respiration.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

The abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A [[spermatophore]] is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt; After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with [[hemolymph]] and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Woodbury, Elton N. |title=Butterflies of Delmarva |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDNHAAAAYAAJ |year=1994 |publisher=Delaware Nature Society; Tidewater Publishers |isbn=978-0-87033-453-5 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviour===
[[File:Australian painted lady feeding.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Australian painted lady]] feeding on a flowering shrub]]

Butterflies feed primarily on [[nectar]] from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from [[pollen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilbert |first=L.

Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do not carry as much pollen load as [[bee]]s, but they are capable of moving pollen over greater distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrera |first=C.

Adult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and [[sodium]] and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung and scavenge rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this [[mud-puddling]] behaviour is restricted to the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients collected may be provided as a [[nuptial gift]], along with the spermatophore, during mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00539.x | last1=Molleman |first1=Freerk | last2=Grunsven |first2=Roy H.

In [[Hill-topping (biology)|hilltopping]], males of some species seek hilltops and ridge tops, which they patrol in search for females. Since it usually occurs in species with low population density, it is assumed these landscape points are used as meeting places to find mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gochfeld |first1=Michael |last2=Burger |first2=Joanna |title=Butterflies of New Jersey: A Guide to Their Status, Distribution, Conservation, and Appreciation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SzNCNPkgQcC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=1997 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2355-2 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as [[sensillum|sensillae]]. A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the [[Arthropod leg#Insects|tarsi]], or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-butterfly.html |title=Article on San Diego Zoo website |publisher=Sandiegozoo.org |access-date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many butterflies use chemical signals, [[pheromone]]s; some have specialized scent scales ([[androconia]]) or other structures ([[coremata]] or &quot;hair pencils&quot; in the Danaidae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birch |first1=M.

[[File:Butterfly midflight.jpg|thumb|''Heteronympha merope'' taking off]]

Many species of butterfly maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may stray into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their temperature is above {{convert|27|°C}}; when it is cool, they can position themselves to expose the underside of the wings to the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches {{convert|40|°C}}, they can orientate themselves with the folded wings edgewise to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Butterflies Make Best Use of the Sunshine |journal=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfHEmTgmHacC&amp;pg=PA13 |date=17 December 1988 |page=13 |issn=0262-4079|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business }}&lt;/ref&gt; Basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ellers | first1=J. | last2=Boggs | first2=Carol L. | year=2002 | title=The Evolution of Wing Color in ''Colias'' Butterflies: Heritability, Sex Linkage, and population divergence | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Pubs/Boggs_pdfs/2002_Ellers_Boggs_Coliaswingcolor.pdf | journal=Evolution | volume=56 | issue=4| pages=836–840 | pmid=12038541 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[0836:teowci]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other insects, the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by steady-state, non-transitory [[aerodynamics]]. Studies using ''[[Vanessa atalanta]]'' in a [[wind tunnel]] show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include [[wake capture]], [[vortices]] at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the [[Torkel Weis-Fogh|Weis-Fogh]] '[[clap-and-fling]]' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Srygley | first1=R. B. | last2=Thomas | first2=A. L.

====Parasitoids, predators, and pathogens====
Butterflies are threatened in their early stages by [[parasitoid]]s and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. [[Braconidae|Braconid]] and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some have been used as biological controls of pest butterflies like the [[Pieris brassicae|large white butterfly]].&lt;ref name=Feltwell401&gt;{{cite book |author=Feltwell, J. |title=Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology of ''Pieris brassicae'' (Linnaeus) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XnrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-8638-1 |pages=401–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Pieris rapae|small cabbage white]] was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies.

Caterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a small percentage of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the [[entomopathogenic fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' has proved effective for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=Feltwell429&gt;{{cite book |author=Feltwell, J. |title=Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology of ''Pieris Brassicae'' (Linnaeus) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XnrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA429 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-8638-1 |page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies protect themselves from predators by a variety of means.
[[File:Papilio cresphontes larva defensive.JPG|thumb|[[Giant swallowtail]] caterpillar everting its [[osmeterium]] in defence; it is also [[mimesis (biology)|mimetic]], resembling a bird dropping.]]

Chemical defences are widespread and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In many cases the plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as [[plant defense against herbivory|protection]] against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145121 | last1=Nishida | first1=Ritsuo | year=2002 | title=Sequestration of Defensive Substances from Plants by Lepidoptera | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=47 | pages=57–92 | pmid=11729069}}&lt;/ref&gt; These defence mechanisms are effective only if they are well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies ([[aposematism]]). This signal is commonly [[mimicry|mimicked]] by other butterflies, usually only females.  A [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism.&lt;ref name=Edmunds/&gt; The [[Papilio polytes|common Mormon]] of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the [[Pachliopta aristolochiae|common rose]] and the [[Pachliopta hector|crimson rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halloran |first1=Kathryn |last2=Wason |first2=Elizabeth |title=''Papilio polytes'' |url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Papilio_polytes/ |website=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |access-date=12 September 2015 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Müllerian mimicry]] occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies from the Americas are a good example.&lt;ref name=Edmunds&gt;{{cite book | author=Edmunds, M. | year=1974 | title=Defence in Animals | url=https://archive.org/details/defenceinanimals0000edmu | url-access=registration | publisher=Longman | pages=[https://archive.org/details/defenceinanimals0000edmu/page/74 74]–78, 100–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect attack from the more vital head region.

Butterflies without defences such as toxins or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more bumpy and unpredictable than in other species. It is assumed this behavior makes it more difficult for predators to catch them, and is caused by the [[turbulence]] created by the small whirlpools formed by the wings during flight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidescience.org/news/mathematical-butterfly-simulations-provide-new-insights-flight The Mathematical Butterfly: Simulations Provide New Insights On Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies have appeared in art from 3500 years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Larsen, Torben |year=1994 |title=Butterflies of Egypt |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=24–27 |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199405/butterflies.of.egypt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]], the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on [[Censer|incense burners]]. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a [[jaguar]], and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the [[Aztec civilisation]]; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilisation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |author=Miller, Mary |year=1993 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-27928-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780500279281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies are widely used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfjoe.com/tag/furniture/ |title=Table Complete with Real Butterflies Embedded in Resin |access-date=30 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506094545/http://mfjoe.com/tag/furniture/ |archive-date=6 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[naturalist]] [[Kjell B.

===In mythology and folklore===
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 033.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Der Schmetterlingsjäger'' (The butterfly hunter) painting by [[Carl Spitzweg]], 1840]]
According to [[Lafcadio Hearn]], a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad [[omen]]s. When [[Taira no Masakado]] was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in [[Kyoto]] so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened—thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hearn | first=Lafcadio | author-link=Lafcadio Hearn | year=1904 | title=Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things | title-link=Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things | publisher=Dover | isbn=978-0-486-21901-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick, Prince of Wales''', [[Knight of the Garter|KG]] (Frederick Louis; 1 February 1707{{snd}}31 March 1751), was [[heir apparent]] to the British throne from 1727 until his death from a lung injury at the age of 44. He was the eldest but estranged son of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], and the father of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] passed by the [[English Parliament]] in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the [[line of succession to the British throne]] at birth, after his [[Sophia, Electress of Hanover|great-grandmother]], [[George I of Great Britain|paternal grandfather]] and father. He moved to Great Britain following the accession of his father, and was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He predeceased his father, however, and upon the latter's death on 25 October 1760, the throne passed to Prince Frederick's eldest son, George III.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales (anonymous).jpg|thumb|left|Prince Frederick, c. 1720.]]
Prince Frederick Lewis was born on 1 February 1707 in [[Hanover]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Germany), as Duke Friedrich Ludwig of Brunswick-Lüneburg, to [[George II of Great Britain|Prince George]], son of [[George I of Great Britain|George, Elector of Hanover]], who was also one of Frederick's two godfathers. The Elector was the son of [[Sophia of Hanover]], granddaughter of [[James VI and I]] and first cousin and heir presumptive to [[Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. However, Sophia died before Anne at age 83 in June 1714, which elevated the Elector to heir-presumptive; Queen Anne died on 1 August the same year, and Sophia's son became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. This made Frederick's father the new Prince of Wales and first-in-line to the British throne and Frederick himself second-in-line. Frederick's other godfather was his grand-uncle [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], King in Prussia and Elector of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm |title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings |access-date=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Fn0l7vK?url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm |archive-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was nicknamed &quot;Griff&quot; within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 20. Van der Kiste observes that &quot;griff&quot; was a Caribbean term for a half-caste, and that it was applied to Frederick because he was &quot;heavy-nosed, thick-lipped and yellow-skinned.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of Anne's death and the coronation of George I, Frederick's parents, George, Prince of Wales (later [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]), and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], were called upon to leave Hanover for Great Britain when their eldest son was only seven years old. He was left in the care of his grand-uncle [[Ernest, Duke of York and Albany|Ernest Augustus]], [[Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück]], and did not see his parents again for 14 years.

In 1722, the 15-year-old Frederick was inoculated against [[smallpox]] by [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]] on the instructions of his mother, Caroline.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather George I created him [[Duke of Edinburgh]], Marquess of the Isle of Ely,&lt;ref name=&quot;gazwales&quot;&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6741/page/2 ''London Gazette'' — creation as Prince of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; Earl of Eltham in the county of Kent, Viscount of Launceston in the county of Cornwall, and Baron of Snaudon in the county of Carnarvon, on 26 July 1726.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazedin&quot;&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/6494/page/1 ''London Gazette'' — creation as Duke of Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two titles have been interpreted differently since: the ''of''s are omitted and ''Snaudon'' rendered as ''Snowdon''.

Frederick arrived in England in 1728 as a grown man, the year after his father had become [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. By then, George and Caroline had had several younger children, and Frederick, himself now Prince of Wales, was a high-spirited youth fond of drinking, gambling and women.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 39, 85&lt;/ref&gt; The long separation damaged their relationship, and they would never be close.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 1728 also saw the foundation of [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], which was named after him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n120 131]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}his other namesakes are [[Prince Frederick, Maryland]] (1722), [[Fort William Henry (Pemaquid Beach, Maine)|Fort Frederick]], Maine (1729–30), [[Fort Frederick Heritage Preserve|Fort Frederick]], South Carolina (1730–34), [[Fort Frederick (Albany)|Fort Frederick]], New York (completed 1735) and [[Fort Frederica National Monument|Fort Frederica]], Georgia (founded 1736), while [[Fort Frederick State Park|Fort Frederick]], Maryland, [[Point Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Point Frederick]], Ontario, [[Fort Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Fort Frederick]], Ontario and [[Fort Frederick (Saint John, New Brunswick)|Fort Frederick]], New Brunswick were also named after him posthumously.

===Prince of Wales===
[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his sisters by Philip Mercier.jpg|thumb|left|The Prince of Wales, c. 1733, with his sisters, [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]], [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]] and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]].]]
The motives for the ill-feeling between Frederick and his parents may include the fact that he had been set up by his grandfather, even as a small child, as the representative of the House of Hanover, and was used to presiding over official occasions in the absence of his parents. He was not permitted to go to Great Britain until after his father took the throne as [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] on 11 June 1727. Frederick had continued to be known as Prince Friedrich Ludwig of Hanover (with his British HRH style) even after his father had been created Prince of Wales.

In 1728, Frederick (his name now anglicised) was finally brought to Britain&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 141–142; Van der Kiste, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; and was created Prince of Wales on 8 January 1729.&lt;ref name=&quot;powprev&quot;&gt;[https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/previous-princes-of-wales Prince of Wales: Previous princes]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the tenth Chancellor of the [[University of Dublin]] from 1728 to 1751, and a portrait of him still enjoys a commanding position in the Hall of the [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

He sponsored a court of 'opposition' politicians. Frederick and his group supported the [[Opera of the Nobility]] in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] as a rival to [[George Frideric Handel]]'s royally sponsored opera at the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in the [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; he is depicted playing a cello in three portraits by [[Philippe Mercier]] of Frederick and his sisters.&lt;ref&gt;The three copies are in the [https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw00125/The-Music-Party?LinkID=mp07308 National Portrait Gallery, London], [https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/11/collection/402414/the-music-party-frederick-prince-of-wales-with-his-three-eldest-sisters the Royal Collection] and [http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/766108 Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire].&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became a thorn in the side of his parents, making a point of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Lord Hervey]]. At court, the favourite was Frederick's younger brother, [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], to the extent that the king looked into ways of splitting his domains so that Frederick would succeed only in Britain, while Hanover would go to William.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vander&quot;&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Hervey and Frederick (using a pseudonym &quot;Captain Bodkin&quot;) wrote a theatrical comedy together which was staged at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in October 1731. It was panned by the critics, and even the theatre's manager thought it so bad that it was unlikely to play out even the first night. He had soldiers stationed in the audience to maintain order, and when the play flopped, the audience was given their money back.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Hervey and Frederick also shared a mistress, [[Anne Vane]], who had a son called FitzFrederick Vane in June 1732. Either of them or [[William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington]], another of her lovers, could have been the father.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Jealousy between them may have contributed to a breach, and their friendship ended. Hervey later wrote bitterly that Frederick was &quot;false&amp;nbsp;... never having the least hesitation in telling any lie that served his present purpose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Van der Kiste, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patron of the arts===
A permanent result of Frederick's patronage of the arts is &quot;[[Rule, Britannia!]]&quot;, one of the best-known British patriotic songs. It was composed by the English composer [[Thomas Arne]] and written by the Scottish poet and playwright [[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|James Thomson]] as part of the [[masque]] ''Alfred'', which was first performed on 1 August 1740 at [[Cliveden]], the country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Thomas Arne was also one of Frederick's favourite artists. A masque linking the Prince with both the medieval hero-king [[Alfred the Great]]'s victories over the [[Vikings]] and with the contemporary issue of building up British [[sea power]] obviously went well with Frederick's political plans and aspirations. Later the song gained a life of its own outside of the masque. Thomson, who supported the Prince of Wales politically, also dedicated an earlier work dedicated to him: ''Liberty'' (1734).

Unlike the king, Frederick was a knowledgeable amateur of painting, who patronised immigrant artists like [[Jacopo Amigoni]] and [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]], who painted the portraits of the prince and his consort for Frederick's champion [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath]]. The list of other artists he employed—[[Philippe Mercier]], [[John Wootton]], [[George Knapton]] and the engraver [[Joseph Goupy]]—represents some of the principal painterly figures of the English [[Rococo]]. The Prince was also crucially important for furthering the popularity of the Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen, patronising silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), ''toyshop'' owners like Paul Bertrand and carver and gilders, the most notable being Paul Petit (1729–c. 1756) who first worked for the prince on [[William Kent]]'s [[Palladian architecture|neo-Palladian]] [[Prince Frederick's Barge|state barge of 1732]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Kent and the Royal Barge.|last=Beard|first=Geoffrey|publisher=The Burlington Magazine , Vol. 112, No. 809, pp 488-493+495.|date=August 1970|isbn=|location=|pages=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still preserved in the [[National Maritime Museum]]. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick that are among the most significant remaining testaments to his patronage of the decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carltonhobbs.com/portfolio-items/a-royal-giltwood-frame-of-colossal-scale-by-paul-petit-at-the-command-of-frederick-prince-of-wales-to-contain-a-portrait-of-frederick-the-great-by-antoine-pesne-1683-1757/ |title=9880{{snd}}A ROYAL GILTWOOD FRAME OF COLOSSAL SCALE BY PAUL PETIT AT THE COMMAND OF FREDERICK, PRINCE OF WALES {{!}} Carlton Hobbs New York |website=carltonhobbs.com |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One frame made for his namesake cousin in 1748, [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the Prince held his cousin, suggesting the Prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, over that of his own father [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by [[Antoine Pesne|Antoine Pense]], and remains today in the [[Royal Collection|British Royal Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/41/collection/406797/frederick-ii-king-of-prussia-1712-86 |title=Antoine Pesne (1683–1757): Frederick II, King of Prussia (1712–86) 1747{{snd}}1748 |website=Royal Collection |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of Frederick's homes are left standing except for the country residence of [[Cliveden]], which is in a much altered state. His London houses of [[Norfolk House]], [[Carlton House]], Leicester House and [[Kew Palace#George II's children|Kew House or the White House]] have all been demolished.

===Domestic life===
Negotiations between George II and his brother-in-law [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] on a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine]] were welcomed by Frederick even though the couple had never met.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; George II was not keen on the proposal but continued talks for diplomatic reasons. Frustrated by the delay, Frederick sent an envoy of his own to the [[Prussian court]]. When the King discovered the plan, he immediately arranged for Frederick to leave Hanover for England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage negotiations foundered when Frederick William demanded that Frederick be made Regent in Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 86, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick also almost married [[Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Lady Diana Spencer]], daughter of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland]] and [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683–1716)|Lady Anne Churchill]]. Lady Diana was the favourite grandchild of the powerful [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]]. The duchess sought a royal alliance by marrying Lady Diana to the Prince of Wales with a massive dowry of £100,000. The prince, who was in great debt, agreed to the proposal, but the plan was vetoed by [[Robert Walpole]] and the king. Lady Diana soon married [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford]].

Although in his youth he was undoubtedly a spendthrift and womaniser, Frederick settled down following his marriage to the sixteen-year-old [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] on 27 April 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-royal-wedding-of-1736|title=The Royal Wedding… of 1736|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was held at the [[Chapel Royal#St James's Palace|Chapel Royal]] at [[St James's Palace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;walford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walford |first1=Edward |title=St James's Palace Pages 100-122 Old and New London: Volume 4.

[[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] provided the new anthem '[[Sing Unto God/Anthem for the Wedding of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Sing unto God]]' for the service and the wedding was also marked in London by two rival operas, Handel's ''[[Atalanta (opera)|Atalanta]]'' and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]]'s ''[[La festa d'Imeneo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-10140|title=Matthew Kilburn, 'Frederick Lewis, prince of Wales (1707–1751)', in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1736, George II returned to Hanover, which resulted in unpopularity in England; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence. &quot;Lost or strayed out of this house&quot;, it read, &quot;a man who has left a wife and six children on the parish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The King made plans to return in the face of inclement weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately he fell ill, with piles and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the King was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales 1754 by Liotard.jpg|thumb|Frederick (pictured) opposed his father's government.]]

Quickly accumulating large debts, Frederick relied for an income on his wealthy friend [[George Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe|George Bubb Dodington]]. The Prince's father refused to make him the financial allowance that the Prince considered should have been his. Frederick's public opposition to his father's government continued; he opposed the unpopular [[Gin Act 1736]], which tried to control the [[Gin Craze]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick applied to Parliament for an increased financial allowance which had hitherto been denied him by the King, and public disagreement over the payment of the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. Frederick's allowance was raised but by less than he had asked for.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and due to give birth in October. In fact, Augusta's due date was earlier and a peculiar episode followed in July in which the Prince, on discovering that his wife had gone into labour, sneaked her out of [[Hampton Court Palace]] in the middle of the night, to ensure that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; George and Caroline were horrified. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against [[supposititious children]], and Augusta had been forced by her husband to ride in a rattling carriage while heavily pregnant and in pain. With a party including two of her daughters and [[John, Lord Hervey|Lord Hervey]], the Queen raced over to [[St James's Palace]], where Frederick had taken Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a &quot;poor, ugly little she-mouse&quot; rather than a &quot;large, fat, healthy boy&quot; which made a supposititious child unlikely since the baby was so pitiful.&lt;ref name=vdk157&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son.&lt;ref name=vdk157/&gt;

Frederick was banished from the King's court,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vander&quot; /&gt; and a rival court grew up at Frederick's new residence, [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; His mother fell fatally ill at the end of the year, but the King refused Frederick permission to see her.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He became a devoted family man, taking his wife and eight children (his youngest daughter was born posthumously) to live in the countryside at [[Cliveden]], where he fished, shot and rowed.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1742, [[Robert Walpole]] left office and the realignment of the government led to a reconciliation between father and son, as Frederick's friends gained influence.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]], Frederick met [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]], who had been imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for aiding the escape of the Rising's leader [[Charles Edward Stuart]], and helped secure her eventual release.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1747, Frederick rejoined the political opposition, and the King responded by calling an [[1747 British general election|early general election]], which Frederick's party lost.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricket===
[[File:Frederick, Prince of Wales attr. to Joseph Highmore.jpg|thumb|Frederick was a cricket enthusiast and patron.]]

By the time Frederick arrived in Great Britain, [[cricket]] had developed into the country's most popular team sport and it thrived on gambling. Perhaps because he wished to anglicise and so fit in with his new society, Frederick developed an academic interest in cricket and soon became a genuine enthusiast. He began to make wagers and then to patronise and play the sport, even forming his own team on several occasions.

The earliest mention of Frederick in cricket annals is in a contemporary report that concerns a [[First-class cricket|first-class match]] on 28 September 1731 between [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] and [[London Cricket Club|London]], played on [[Kennington Common]]. No post-match report was found despite advance promotion as &quot;likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time&quot;. The records show that &quot;for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a new practice in 1731 and possibly done partly for the benefit of a royal visitor. The advertisement refers to &quot;the whole county of Surrey&quot; as London's opponents and states that the Prince of Wales is &quot;expected to attend&quot;.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[[H. T. Waghorn]], ''The Dawn of Cricket'', Electric Press, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1732, the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'' reported that Frederick attended &quot;a great cricket match&quot; at Kew on 27 July.&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G. B. Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1733 season, Frederick was seriously involved in the game, in effect as a county cricketer for Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Morris  ''Poor Fred and the Butcher : Sons of George II'' London 1970 p41  {{ISBN|0718108167}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have given a guinea to each player in a Surrey vs. [[Middlesex county cricket teams|Middlesex]] game at [[Moulsey Hurst]].&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; Then he awarded a silver cup to a combined Surrey &amp; Middlesex team which had just beaten [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]], arguably the best county team at the time, at Moulsey Hurst on 1 August.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[H. T. Waghorn]], ''Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730–1773)'', Blackwood, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first reference in cricket history to any kind of trophy (other than hard cash) being contested. On 31 August, the Prince of Wales' XI played [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]]'s XI on Moulsey Hurst. The result is unknown but the teams were said to be of county standard, so presumably it was in effect a Surrey vs. Sussex match.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;[[Timothy J. McCann]], ''Sussex Cricket in the Eighteenth Century'', Sussex Record Society, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following 1733, there are frequent references to the Prince of Wales as a patron of cricket and as an occasional player.

When he died on 31 March 1751 (N.S), cricket suffered a double blow as his death closely followed that of [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond]], the game's greatest financial patron at the time. Accordingly, the number of top-class matches declined for several years, although economic difficulties and priorities from the wars of the period certainly inhibited many potential investors.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300–1787 |accessdate=29 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140105/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html#wales |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His political ambitions unfulfilled, Frederick died at Leicester House at the age of 44 on 31 March 1751 (20 March 1750 [[Old style|OS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=9042 |date=23 March 1750 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past this has been attributed to a burst [[human lung|lung]] [[abscess]] caused by a blow from a cricket or a [[real tennis]] ball,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fisher, ''Princes of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now thought to have been from a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/41xVBDYmZgbmgwPNc9XlNY8/frederick-prince-of-wales|title=Frederick Prince of Wales|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Livingstone|first=Natalie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D64CDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Frederick%22+%22blood+clot+in+his+lungs%22&amp;pg=PA239|title=The Mistresses of Cliveden: Three Centuries of Scandal, Power and Intrigue in an English Stately Home|date=2016-04-07|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-959472-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 13 April 1751. He is the most recent Prince of Wales not to have acceded to the British throne.

The Prince of Wales' [[epigram]] (quoted by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], &quot;Four Georges&quot;):
&lt;poem&gt;
::&quot;Here lies poor Fred who was alive and is dead,
::Had it been his father I had much rather,
::Had it been his sister nobody would have missed her,
::Had it been his brother, still better than another,
::Had it been the whole generation, so much better for the nation,
::But since it is Fred who was alive and is dead,
::There is no more to be said!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

He was given the title [[Duke of Gloucester]] on 10 January 1717,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Alison Weir|last=Weir|first=Alison|year=1996|title=Britain's Royal Families: A Complete Genealogy|edition=Revised|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|isbn=978-0-7126-7448-5|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when he was raised to the peerage in 1726 it was as duke of Edinburgh only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gloucester, Earls and Dukes of|volume=12|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms===
Between his creation as Duke of Edinburgh in 1726 and his creation as Prince of Wales, he bore the arms of the kingdom, differentiated by a ''label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules''. [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|As Prince of Wales]], the difference changed to simply a ''label argent of three points''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick never succeeded his father as Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire and so the red escutcheon in the centre of his Hanover quarter is empty.&lt;ref&gt;

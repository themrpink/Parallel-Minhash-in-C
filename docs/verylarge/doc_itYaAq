[[Friedrich Hayek]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics rejected the very idea of social justice as meaningless, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty:
{{quote|There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term 'a moral stone'.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F.A. (1982). ''Law, Legislation and Liberty, Vol. 2''. Routledge. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hayek argued that proponents of social justice often present it as a moral virtue but most of their descriptions pertain to impersonal states of affairs (e.g. income inequality, poverty), which are cited as &quot;social injustice.&quot; Hayek argued that social justice is either a virtue or it is not. If it is, it can only be ascribed to the actions of individuals. However, most who use the term ascribe it to social systems, so &quot;social justice&quot; in fact describes a regulative principle of order; they are interested not in virtue but power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak, Michael 2000&quot;/&gt; For Hayek, this notion of social justices presupposes that people are guided by specific external directions rather than internal, personal rules of just conduct. It further presupposes that one can never be held accountable for ones own behaviour, as this would be &quot;blaming the victim.&quot; According to Hayek, the function of social justice is to blame someone else, often attributed to &quot;the system&quot; or those who are supposed, mythically, to control it. Thus it is based on the appealing idea of &quot;you suffer; your suffering is caused by powerful others; these oppressors must be destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak, Michael 2000&quot;/&gt;

Ben O'Neill of the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[Mises Institute]] argues:
{{quote|[For advocates of &quot;social justice&quot;] the notion of &quot;rights&quot; is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient. It is merely an assertion of desire, and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire.

In fact, since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods, paid for through the efforts of others, the term actually refers to an intention to use ''force'' to acquire one's desires. Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action, production and voluntary exchange, but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them!&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Ben (16 March 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice The Injustice of Social Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028092912/http://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice |date=28 October 2014 }}, ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[William Morris]] design for &quot;Trellis&quot; wallpaper, 1862]]
The '''Arts and Crafts movement''' was an international trend in the [[Decorative arts|decorative]] and [[fine arts]] that developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-518948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Kaplan and Alan Crawford, ''The Arts &amp; Crafts movement in Europe &amp; America: Design for the Modern World'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated in reaction against the perceived impoverishment of the decorative arts and the conditions in which they were produced,&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;&gt;Brenda M. King, ''Silk and Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; the movement flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920. In Japan it emerged in the 1920s as the [[Mingei]] movement. It stood for traditional craftsmanship, and often used [[Medievalism|medieval]], [[Romanticism|romantic]], or [[Folk art|folk]] styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was anti-industrial in its orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses N. Ikiugu and Elizabeth A. Ciaravino, ''Psychosocial Conceptual Practice models in Occupational Therapy''; {{cite web|publisher= [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html | title= Arts and Crafts Style Guide | work=British Galleries | accessdate= 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by [[Modernism]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot; /&gt; and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;maccarthy2014&quot; /&gt;

The term was first used by [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson]] at a meeting of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in 1887,&lt;ref name=crawford&gt;Alan Crawford, ''C. R. Ashbee: Architect, Designer &amp; Romantic Socialist'', Yale University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0300109393}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years. It was inspired by the ideas of architect [[Augustus Pugin]], writer [[John Ruskin]], and designer [[William Morris]].&lt;ref name=triggs&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://archive.org/details/chaptersinhistor00trig | first= Oscar Lovell | last=Triggs | title=Chapters in the History of the Arts and Crafts Movement | publisher = Bohemia Guild of the Industrial Art League | year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland it is associated with key figures such as [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sumpner|first1=Dave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cCMDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=key+Rennie|title=My Revision Notes: Pearson Edexcel A Level Design and Technology (Product Design)|last2=Morrison|first2=Julia|date=2020-02-28|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-1-5104-7422-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
===Design reform===
The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items that they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]], which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used. Art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] writes that the exhibits showed &quot;ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface&quot;, as well as displaying &quot;vulgarity in detail&quot;.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; Design reform began with Exhibition organizers [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809–1874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820–1877), and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804–1888),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&amp;A, &quot;Wallpaper Design Reform&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom deprecated excessive ornament and impractical or badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organizers were &quot;unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits.&quot;{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that &quot;the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter&quot; produced &quot;novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence.&quot;{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analyzed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for &quot;more logic in the application of decoration.&quot;{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein, such as Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' (&quot;Science, Industry and Art&quot;) (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876), and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}

Jones declared that ornament &quot;must be secondary to the thing decorated&quot;, that there must be &quot;fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented&quot;, and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns &quot;suggestive of anything but a level or plain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''&lt;/ref&gt; A fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, whereas these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that &quot;style&quot; demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. &quot;''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation.&quot;{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}

[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]

However, the design reformers of the mid-19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts movement. They were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticize industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform, and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.

===A. W. N. Pugin===
[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house &quot;The Grange&quot; in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts movement.]]

Some of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812–1852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he advocated truth to material, structure, and function, as did the Arts and Crafts artists.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt; Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society with the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor—a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris, and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that he &quot;reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmanship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail.&quot; She describes the spare furnishings which he specified for a building in 1841, &quot;rush chairs, oak tables&quot;, as &quot;the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo.&quot;&lt;ref name=hill /&gt;

===John Ruskin===
The Arts and Crafts philosophy was derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of its work. Ruskin considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be &quot;servile labour&quot;, and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things that they made. He believed factory-made works to be &quot;dishonest,&quot; and that handwork and craftsmanship merged dignity with labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts-crafts.com/archive/jruskin.shtml|title=John Ruskin - Artist Philosopher Writer - Arts &amp; Crafts Leader|website=www.arts-crafts.com|access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself.&lt;ref name=sarsby&gt;Jacqueline Sarsby&quot; Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds&quot;, ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375–397&lt;/ref&gt; William Morris's idea of &quot;handicraft&quot; was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Morris===
[[File: William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, a textile designer who was a key influence on the Arts and Crafts movement]]
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) was the towering figure in late 19th-century design and the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the movement grew out of ideas that he developed in the 1850s with the [[Birmingham Set]] – a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]] including [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96–97}} By 1855, they had discovered Ruskin. The medievalism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In Burne-Jones' words, they intended to &quot;wage Holy warfare against the age&quot;.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}

[[File: The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Bexleyheath, designed by Philip Webb and completed in 1860; one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts movement&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, &quot;Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Morris began experimenting with various crafts and designing furniture and interiors.{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging. Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that &quot;without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life&quot;.{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}

[[File: Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris &amp; Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]

In 1861, Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modelling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colours. His patterns were based on flora and fauna, and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. Some were deliberately left unfinished in order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, thus creating a rustic appearance. Morris strove to unite all the arts within the decoration of the home, emphasizing nature and simplicity of form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm|title=The Arts and Crafts Movement in America|date=2019|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819–1900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'

===Critique of industry===
William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was &quot;altogether an evil&quot;,&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but at others times, he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Shankland, &quot;William Morris - Designer&quot;, in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris said that in a &quot;true society&quot;, where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.&lt;ref&gt;William Morris, &quot;Useful Work versus Useless Toil&quot;, in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacCarthy says that &quot;unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed.&quot;{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}

Morris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. &quot;Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the Middle Ages was a period of greatness in the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches&amp;nbsp;– each one a masterpiece&amp;nbsp;— were built by unsophisticated peasants.&quot;&lt;ref name=mingei/&gt; Medieval art was the model for much of Arts and Crafts design, and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.

Morris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. For example, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee]], a central figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, said in 1888, that, &quot;We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered.&quot;&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, C.&amp;nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that &quot;Modern civilization rests on machinery&quot;,&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called &quot;mechanism&quot;, saying that &quot;the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)

Morris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that &quot;The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms.&quot;&lt;ref name=floud&gt;Peter Floud, &quot;The crafts then and now&quot;, ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived &quot;not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=floud/&gt;

===Socialism===
Many of the Arts and Crafts movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], and [[A. H. Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s, Morris was spending more of his time on promoting socialism than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen called the Guild of Handicraft in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Those adherents who were not socialists, such as [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],&lt;ref name=sarsby/&gt; advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]] was another successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer who was not a socialist, despite his long friendship with Crane.

===Association with other reform movements===
In Britain, the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&amp;A, &quot;Victorian Dress at the V&amp;A&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of &quot;the Simple Life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://64.130.23.120/history-of-art/arts-and-crafts.htm | title=Arts and Crafts movement | accessdate=5 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Morris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris &amp; Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.

The spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}

In 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}

In 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}

In 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.

The London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the &quot;[[artistic dress]]&quot; favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, &quot;Of the Arts and Crafts Movement&quot;, in ''Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'', George Bell &amp; Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris &amp; Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries. [[Edward Burne-Jones]] observed, &quot;here for the first time one can measure a bit the change that has happened in the last twenty years&quot;.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=596}} The society still exists as the Society of Designer Craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/ |title=Society of Designer Craftsmen |publisher=Society of Designer Craftsmen |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.R.Ashbee]], a major late practitioner of the style in England, founded the [[Guild and School of Handicraft]] in the East End of London. The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129132321/http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |archive-date=2010-01-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.A. Voysey]] (1857–1941) was an Arts and Crafts architect who also designed fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture and metalwork.  His style combined simplicity with sophistication. His wallpapers and textiles, featuring stylised bird and plant forms in bold outlines with flat colors, were used widely.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

Morris's thought influenced the [[distributism]] of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coleton Fishacre - geograph.org.uk - 928003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coleton Fishacre]] was designed in 1925 as a holiday home in Kingswear, Devon, England, in the Arts and Crafts tradition.]]

By the end of the nineteenth century, Arts and Crafts ideals had influenced architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book making and photography, domestic design and the decorative arts, including furniture and woodwork, stained glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Peter|title=Arts and Crafts Stained Glass|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-20970-9|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug making and weaving, jewelry and metalwork, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ing and ceramics.&lt;ref name=&quot;dublin&quot;&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe and Elizabeth Cumming, ''The Arts And Crafts Movements in Dublin and Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, there was a fashion for &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot; and all things hand-made. There was a proliferation of amateur handicrafts of variable quality&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arts and Crafts&quot;, ''Journal of the Royal Society of Arts'', Vol. 56, No. 2918, 23 October 1908, pp. 1023-1024&lt;/ref&gt; and of incompetent imitators who caused the public to regard Arts and Crafts as &quot;something less, instead of more, competent and fit for purpose than an ordinary mass produced article.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Rooke]], &quot;The Craftsman and Education for Industry&quot;, in ''Four Papers Read by Members of the Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition Society'', London: Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Tania Harrod, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-300-07780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the [[Deutsche Werkbund]] and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the [[Omega Workshops]] and the [[Design in Industries Association]], the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as &quot;decommoditisation&quot;&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Nikolaus Pevsner in his book ''Pioneers of Modern Design'' presents the Arts and Crafts movement as design radicals who influenced the modern movement, but failed to change and were eventually superseded by it.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

===Later influences===
The British artist potter [[Bernard Leach]] brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic [[Yanagi Soetsu]] about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, [[Fiona MacCarthy]], detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the [[Festival of Britain]] (1951), the work of the designer [[Terence Conran]] (b. 1931)&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; and the founding of the British [[Crafts Council]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=603}}

=== Scotland ===
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–1877). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–1891), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer - 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had an &quot;extraordinary flowering&quot; in Scotland where it was represented by the development of the '[[Glasgow Style]]' which was based on the talent of the [[Glasgow School of Art]].  Celtic revival took hold here, and motifs such as the Glasgow rose became popularised. [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868 – 1928) and the Glasgow School of Art were to influence others worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dublin&quot; /&gt;[[File:The Robert Owen Museum, Newtown.jpg|thumb|left|The Robert Owen Museum, Newtown, by [[Frank Shayler]].]]

===Wales===
The situation in Wales was different than elsewhere in the UK. Insofar as craftsmanship was concerned, Arts and Crafts was a ''revivalist'' campaign. But in Wales, at least until [[World War I]], a genuine craft tradition still existed. Local materials, stone or clay, continued to be used as a matter of course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hilling|first=John B.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oe2VDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Arts+and+Crafts+Movement+Wales&amp;pg=PA221|title=The Architecture of Wales: From the First to the Twenty-First Century|date=2018-08-15|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-1-78683-285-6|location=|pages=221|language=en}} 'Arts and Crafts' to Early Modernism, 1900 to 1939&lt;/ref&gt;  

Scotland become known in the Arts and Crafts movement for its stained glass; Wales would become known for its pottery. By the mid 19th century, the heavy, salt glazes used for generations by local craftsmen had gone out of fashion, not least as mass-produced ceramics undercut prices. But the Arts and Crafts Movement  brought new appreciation to their work. Horace W Elliot, an English gallerist, visited the [[Ewenny Pottery]] (which dated back to the 17th century) in 1885, to both find local pieces and encourage a style compatible with the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aslet|first=Clive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-Pa9IIfP3QC&amp;q=Ewenny+Pottery+Arts+and+Crafts+Elliot&amp;pg=PA477|title=Villages of Britain: The Five Hundred Villages that Made the Countryside|date=2010-10-04|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-7475-8872-6|location=|pages=477|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces he brought back to London for the next twenty years revivified interest in Welsh pottery work.

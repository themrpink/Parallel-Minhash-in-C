Philadelphia has eight official [[Sister city|sister cities]] as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:&lt;ref name=&quot;Diplomacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdiphila.org/sister_cities_program |title=Citizen Diplomacy International Philadelphia Sister Cities Program |website=cdiphila.org |publisher=Citizen Diplomacy International Philadelphia |accessdate=April 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of {{convert|0.5|acre|sqyd}} located at 18th and [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] within [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Square]], was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Florence]]. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with [[Toruń]], Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the [[United Way of America|United Way]] building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to [[environmentally friendly]] standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;renovation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ivc.org/sister_cities_park | title=Sister Cities Park | website=ivc.org | publisher=International Visitors Council of Philadelphia | accessdate=June 3, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194541/http://www.ivc.org/sister_cities_park | archive-date=January 16, 2013 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://centercityphila.org/parks/sister-cities-park/sister-cities-park-history | title=Sister Cities Park History |website=centercityphila.org | publisher=Center City District{{!}}Central Philadelphia Development Corporation{{!}}Center City District Foundation | accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of [[Tianjin]], stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with [[Arch Street (Philadelphia)|Arch Street]], as a symbol of the sister city relationship.

The '''1967 International and Universal Exposition''' or '''Expo 67''', as it was commonly known, was a general exhibition, Category One [[World's Fair]] held in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, from April 27 to October 29, 1967. It is considered to be the most successful World's Fair of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voicesofeastanglia.com/2011/11/the-most-successful-world-fair-expo-67.html &quot;The Most Successful World Fair – Expo 67&quot;]. ''Voices of East Anglia''&lt;/ref&gt; with the most attendees to that date and 62 nations participating.  It also set the single-day attendance record for a world's fair, with 569,500 visitors on its third day.

Expo 67 was Canada's main celebration during its [[Canadian Centennial|centennial year]]. The fair had been intended to be held in [[Moscow]], to help the [[Soviet Union]] celebrate the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]'s 50th anniversary; however, for various reasons, the Soviets decided to cancel, and Canada was awarded it in late 1962.

The project was not well supported in Canada at first. It took the determination of Montreal's mayor, [[Jean Drapeau]], and a new team of managers to guide it past political, physical and temporal hurdles. Defying a computer analysis that said it could not be done, the fair opened on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Local Development Benefits from Staging Global Events|last=OECD|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-9264042070|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Expo 67 ended in October 1967, the site and most of the pavilions continued on as an exhibition called '''Man and His World''', open during the summer months from 1968 until 1984. By that time, most of the buildings—which had not been designed to last beyond the original exhibition—had deteriorated and were dismantled.  Today, the islands that hosted the world exhibition are mainly used as parkland and for recreational use, with only a few remaining structures from Expo 67 to show that the event was held there.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:expopass.jpg|right|thumb|325 px| Expo 67 passport]]
The idea of hosting the 1967 World Exhibition dates back to 1957. &quot;I believe it was Colonel Sevigny who first asked me to do what I could to bring Canada's selection as the site for the international exposition in 1967.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=One Canada The Years of Achievement 1956 to 1962 | last=Diefenbaker | first=John G | publisher=Macmillan of Canada | year=1976 | isbn=077051443X | pages=[https://archive.org/details/onecanadamemoirs0000dief/page/303 303] | url=https://archive.org/details/onecanadamemoirs0000dief/page/303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montreal's mayor, [[Sarto Fournier]], backed the proposal, allowing Canada to make a bid to the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE).  At the BIE's May 5, 1960 meeting in [[Paris]], Moscow was awarded the fair after five rounds of voting that eliminated Austria's and then Canada's bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(It is now fourth, having been surpassed by [[Expo '70|Osaka (1970)]] and [[Expo 2010|Shanghai (2010)]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;Expo 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Several sites were proposed as the main Expo grounds. One location that was considered was [[Mount Royal]] Park, to the north of the downtown core.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simms&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | last1         = Simms

The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Expo did not get off to a smooth start; in 1963, many top organizing committee officials resigned. The main reason for the resignations was Mayor Drapeau's choice of the site on new islands to be created around the existing St. Helen's Island and also that a computer program predicted that the event could not possibly be constructed in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | access-date  = April 26, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more likely reason for the mass resignations was that on April 22, 1963, the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]] took power. This meant that former Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government appointees to the board of directors of the Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition were likely forced to resign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berton, p. 262&quot;&gt;Berton, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian diplomat [[Pierre Dupuy (diplomat)|Pierre Dupuy]] was named Commissioner General, after Diefenbaker appointee Paul Bienvenu resigned from the post in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.263&quot;&gt;Berton, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main responsibilities of the Commissioner General was to attract other nations to build pavilions at Expo.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.263&quot; /&gt; Dupuy would spend most of 1964 and 1965 soliciting 125 countries, spending more time abroad than in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.264&quot;&gt;Berton, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  Dupuy's 'right-hand' man was [[Robert Fletcher Shaw]], the deputy commissioner general and vice-president of the corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.264&quot; /&gt;  He also replaced a Diefenbaker appointee, C.F. Carsley, Deputy Commissioner General.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.264&quot; /&gt; Shaw was a professional engineer and builder, and is widely credited for the total building of the Exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.264&quot; /&gt; Dupuy hired Andrew Kniewasser as the general manager. The management group became known as ''Les Durs''—the tough guys—and they were in charge of creating, building and managing Expo.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.264&quot; /&gt; ''Les Durs'' consisted of: Jean-Claude Delorme, Legal Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation; Dale Rediker, Director of Finances; Colonel Edward Churchill, Director of Installations; [[Philippe de Gaspé Beaubien]], Director of Operations, dubbed &quot;The Mayor of Expo&quot;; Pierre de Bellefeuille, Director of Exhibitors; and Yves Jasmin, Director of Information, Advertising and Public Relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidebook&quot; /&gt; To this group the chief architect Édouard Fiset was added. All ten were honoured by the Canadian government as recipients of the Order of Canada, Companions for Dupuy and Shaw, Officers for the others.

Jasmin wrote a book, in French, ''La petite histoire d'Expo 67'', about his 45-month experience at Expo and created the Expo 67 Foundation (available on the web site under that name) to commemorate the event for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As historian [[Pierre Berton]] put it, the cooperation between Canada's French- and English-speaking communities &quot;was the secret of Expo's success—'the [[Quebec|Québécois]] flair, the English-Canadian pragmatism.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berton also points out that this is an over-simplification of national stereotypes. Arguably Expo did, for a short period anyway, bridge the '[[Two Solitudes (Canadian society)|Two Solitudes]].'&lt;ref&gt;Berton, pp.269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montebello conference produces theme===
In May 1963, a group of prominent Canadian thinkers—including Alan Jarvis, director of the [[National Gallery of Canada]]; novelists [[Hugh MacLennan]] and [[Gabrielle Roy]]; [[J. Tuzo Wilson]], geophysicist; and Claude Robillard, town planner—met for three days at the [[Château Montebello|Seigneury Club]] in [[Montebello, Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme, &quot;Man and His World&quot;, was based on the 1939 book entitled ''Terre des Hommes'' (translated as ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'') by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]. In Roy's introduction to the Expo 67 corporation's book, entitled ''Terre des Hommes/Man and His World'', she elucidates the theme:

===Byzantine period===
Petra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, [[Galilee earthquake of 363|an earthquake]] destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DF143EF934A25753C1A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock | first=Grace | last=Glueck | date=2003-10-17 | access-date=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of [[Palaestina Salutaris|Palaestina III]] and many churches from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the [[Byzantine Church (Petra)|Byzantine Church]], [[Petra papyri|140 papyri]] were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History|last=Frösén|first=Jaakko|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.| year= 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah06244|chapter = Petra papyri|isbn = 9781444338386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.

The last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the ''Spiritual Meadow'' of [[John Moschus]], written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, [[Athenogenes of Petra|Athenogenes]]. It ceased to be a [[metropolitan bishop]]ric sometime before 687, when that function had been transferred to [[Rabba|Areopolis]]. Petra is not mention in the narratives of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.&lt;ref&gt;Zbigniew T. Fiema, Ahmad Al-Jallad, Michael C. A. Macdonald, and Laïla Nehmé, &quot;Provincia Arabia: Nabataea, the Emergence of Arabic as a Written Language, and Graeco-Arabica, in Greg Fisher (ed.), ''Arabs and Empires before Islam'' (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusaders and Mamluks===
In the 12th century, the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusaders]] built fortresses such as the [[Alwaeira Castle]], but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost for the Western world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nabataea.net/crusades.html|title=Nabataea: The Crusades|website=nabataea.net|access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/reconstructing-petra-155444564/|title=Reconstructing Petra|last=Lawler|first=Andrew|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to [[Little Petra]]. It is the castle of Valle Moise which was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.

The ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the [[Middle Ages]] and were visited by [[Baibars]], one of the first [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultans of Egypt]], towards the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===19th-20th centuries===
[[File:Gravkammare 2.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Royal Tombs in Petra]]
The first European to describe them was Swiss traveller [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] during his travels in 1812.&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Burckhardt1822&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first=John Lewis |last= Burckhardt|title=Travels in Syria and the Holy Land| url= https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.22956| year=1822 |publisher= J. Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Greek Church of Jerusalem]] operated a diocese in [[Al Karak]] named Battra (باطره in Arabic, and Πέτρας in Greek) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.&lt;ref name= &quot;Burckhardt1822&quot;/&gt;

[[Léon de Laborde]] and [[Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds|Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds]] made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Gerald L.|title=Frederic Edwin Church: Catalogue Raisonne of Works at Olana State Historic Site, Volume I|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0521385404|location=Cambridge|pages=386–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish painter [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] visited Petra in 1839 and returned to England with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]''. [[Frederic Edwin Church]], the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting ''[[El Khasné, Petra (painting)|El Khasné, Petra]]'' is among his most important and well-documented.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Comparative Petra siq.jpg|thumb|Petra [[Siq]] in 1947 (left) compared with the same location in 2013]]
Because the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team, consisting of British archaeologists [[Agnes Conway]] and [[George Horsfield]], Palestinian physician and folklore expert Dr [[Tawfiq Canaan]] and Dr Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conway |first1=A. |last2=Horsfield |first2=G. |year=1930 |title=Historical and Topographical Notes on Edom: with an account of the first excavations at Petra |journal= The Geographical Journal |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=369–390|doi=10.2307/1784200 |jstor=1784200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist Philip Hammond from the [[University of Utah]] visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of [[Moses]], when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the [[Israelites]]. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP9ku2EAahM|title=Forbidden Archaeology of Petra and Nazca|publisher=National Geographic|year=2018|format=documentary|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the [[Byzantine]] period were discovered in an excavated church near the [[Temple of the Winged Lions]] in Petra in December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/archaeology/lost-city-petra/ |title= Petra| work= National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{further|Nabataean religion}}
[[Image:Great Temple of Petra 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Temple (Petra)|Great Temple]] of Petra]]
The Nabataeans worshipped [[Arab mythology|Arab gods]] and [[goddess]]es during the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] era as well as a few of their [[Apotheosis|deified]] kings. One, [[Obodas I]], was deified after his death. [[Dushara]] was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: [[Al-Uzza|Al-‘Uzzā]], [[Allat]] and [[Manāt]]. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader [[Edom]]ite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.&lt;ref&gt;Paradise T.R. &amp; Angel C.C. 2015, [http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcuser/winter-2015/nabataean-architecture-and-the-sun Nabatean Architecture and the Sun, ArcUser (Winter)].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[stele]] dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech – king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a [[star and crescent]] (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with [[Harran]] (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus – bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Nabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, [[Baal]] and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi – god decided (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi – 'gods covenant' (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi 'Allah is peace' and Shalm-allat, 'the peace of the goddess'. We also find Amat-allahi 'she-servant of god' and Halaf-llahi 'the successor of Allah'.&lt;ref&gt;Negev 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Petra has been put forward as the original 'Mecca' by some in the [[revisionist school of Islamic studies]], owing to claims of large numbers of independent pieces of evidence, namely that the early original mosques faced Petra, not [[Jerusalem]] or [[Mecca]], as the direction of Muslim prayer, the [[Qibla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Dan |title=Early Islamic Qiblas: A survey of mosques built between 1AH/622 C.E. and 263 AH/876 C.E. |isbn=978-1927581223|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques’ Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=David A. |title=The Petra Fallacy |url=https://www.academia.edu/37957366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petra (Raqēmō) does receive mention in the Qur'an in the [[Al-Kahf|Surah al-Kahf]] as الرقيم ''al-Raqīm''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:The Monastery, Petra, Jordan8.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ad Deir]] (&quot;The Monastery&quot;)]]
[[Ad Deir|The Monastery]], Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic [[Ad Deir]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The [[Temple of the Winged Lions]] is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]] (9 BCE–40 CE). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the [[Qasr al-Bint]] and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.

[[Christianity]] found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] mentions a bishop of Petra (Anhioch. 10) named [[Asterius of Petra|Asterius]]. At least one of the tombs (the &quot;tomb with the urn&quot;?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration &quot;in the time of the most holy bishop Jason&quot; (447). After the [[Islam]]ic conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the [[First Crusade]] Petra was occupied by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and formed the second [[fief]] of the [[feudal barony|barony]] of [[Al Karak]] (in the lordship of [[Oultrejordain]]) with the title ''Château de la Valée de Moyse'' or Sela. It remained in the hands of the [[Franks]] until 1189.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Petra |volume=21 |pages=309–310 |first=George Albert |last=Cooke|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still a [[titular see]] of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Petra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where [[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, [[Islamic view of Aaron|Harun]] ([[Aaron]]), is [[Tomb of Aaron|buried]], at [[Mount Hor]], known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or &quot;Wadi of Moses&quot; is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister [[Miriam]] was still shown to pilgrims at the time of [[Jerome]] in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/jordan/petra_ruins.htm |title=Petra |publisher=Sacred Sites |access-date=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bidoul/Bidul (Petra [[Bedouin]]) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process.{{citation needed|date= February 2020}} They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.go2petra.com/guide_inside_clickmap.htm|title=Map of the area| website= go2petra.com |access-date= 2015-06-04|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180313061923/http://www.go2petra.com/guide_inside_clickmap.htm| archive-date= 2018-03-13| url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visitpetra.jo/Pages/viewpage.aspx?pageID=129|title=Archeological Park |website= VisitPetra.jo |access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bidouls belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage List]] in 2005 and inscribed&lt;ref name=bedu&gt;{{cite web| title= The Cultural Space of the Bedu in Petra and Wadi Rum |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00122 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |access-date=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008.

In 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pdtra.gov.jo/SchemeFiles/English/communities%2520master%2520plans/Umm%2520Sayhoun%2520Strategy.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=hUxsVY_FLsuNsgHv7aHoAw&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSZAz2PGlfOtLIHYBNhXxtIjoPTA |work= pdtra.gov.jo| publisher= Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l. |title=Strategic Plan for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas |dead-link=yes |date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pdtra.gov.jo/UploadedFiles/PDETRA_Folder/English/communities%20master%20plans/Umm%20Sayhoun%20Strategy.pdf |work= pdtra.gov.jo| publisher= Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in Association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l. |title=Strategic Plan for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas |access-date=8 April 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the perspective of Petra Archaeological Park
*the perspective of Petra's tourism product
*a land use perspective
*an environmental perspective

[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting abuse against working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered.

'''Oil shale''' is an organic-rich [[fine-grained]] [[sedimentary rock]] containing [[kerogen]] (a solid mixture of [[organic chemical compound]]s) from which liquid [[hydrocarbon]]s can be produced, called [[shale oil]] (not to be confused with [[tight oil]]—[[Petroleum|crude oil]] occurring naturally in shales).  Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its [[Environmental impact of the oil shale industry|environmental impact]].&lt;ref name=csm/&gt;  [[Deposition (geology)|Deposits]] of oil shale occur around the world, including major deposits in the [[United States]]. A 2016 estimate of global deposits set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent of {{convert|6.05|Toilbbl|e9m3|abbr=off}} of [[oil in place]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wec2016 16&quot;&gt;[[#wec2016|WEC (2016)]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of [[pyrolysis]] to [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] a [[vapor]]. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid [[shale oil]]—an [[unconventional oil]]—is separated from [[Combustibility|combustible]] [[Oil shale gas|oil-shale gas]] (the term ''[[shale gas]]'' can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be [[combustion|burned]] directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for [[Electricity generation|power generation]] and [[district heating]] or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.&lt;ref name=dyni&gt;

General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix, [[bitumen]]s, and kerogen.  Oil shales differ from oil-''bearing'' shales, shale deposits that contain petroleum ([[tight oil]]) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples of oil-''bearing'' shales are the [[Bakken Formation]], [[Pierre Shale]], [[Niobrara Formation]], and [[Eagle Ford Formation]].

While oil sands do originate from the [[biodegradation]] of oil, heat and pressure have not (yet) transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum, that means that its [[Maturity (geology)|maturation]] does not exceed early [[Catagenesis (geology)|mesocatagenetic]].&lt;ref name=urov/&gt;&lt;ref name=geolsoc&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal. In commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and 1.5:5. At the same time, the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) approximately 1.2 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3&amp;nbsp;times higher than for coals.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wec 94&quot;&gt;[[#wec|Dyni (2010)]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vankrevelen&gt;[[#vankrevelen|van Krevelen (1993)]], p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;  The organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms, such as the remains of [[algae]], [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[plant cuticle]]s and corky fragments of [[herbaceous]] and woody plants, and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;wec 94&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=alali&gt;

Another classification, known as the van Krevelen diagram, assigns kerogen types, depending on the [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], and [[oxygen]] content of oil shales' original organic matter.&lt;ref name=turkey/&gt; The most commonly used classification of oil shales, developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton, adapts [[Petrography|petrographic]] terms from coal terminology.

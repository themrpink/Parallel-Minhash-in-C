As typical of Asian rivers, [[Cyprinidae]] is by far the most diverse family in the Yellow River basin. More than 85 cyprinids have been recorded in this basin, including species that still are present and species that no longer are present. Other highly diverse families are the [[Nemacheilidae|stone loaches]] (more than 20 species), [[Gobiidae|gobies]] ({{circa}} 15 species), [[true loach]]es ({{circa}} 10 species) and [[bagrid catfish]] ({{circa}} 10 species).&lt;ref name=Xie2018/&gt;&lt;!-- for species list, see &quot;Supporting Information&quot; in Xie2018 --&gt; Although there are species found throughout much of the river, several have a more restricted range. For example, the uppermost, highest parts on the [[Qinghai–Tibet Plateau]] has relatively few native species, notably snowtrout and allies (''[[Gymnocypris]]'', ''[[Gymnodiptychus]]'', ''[[Platypharodon]]'' and ''[[Schizopygopsis]]''), and ''[[Triplophysa]]'' loaches.&lt;ref name=Qi2016&gt;{{cite book | author=Qi, D. | year=2016 | chapter=Fish of the Upper Yellow River | editor1=Brierley, G. | editor2=Li, X. | editor3=Cullum, C. | editor4=Gao, J. | title=Landscape and Ecosystem Diversity, Dynamics and Management in the Yellow River Source Zone | publisher=Springer Geography.

Fishing remains an important activity, but catches have declined. In 2007, it was noted that 40% fewer fish were caught in the Yellow River compared to earlier catches.&lt;ref name=Watts2007/&gt; Large cyprinids ([[Asian carp]], [[predatory carp]], [[Wuchang bream]] and [[Mongolian redfin]]) and large catfish ([[Amur catfish|Amur]] and [[Silurus lanzhouensis|Lanzhou catfish]]) are still present, but the largest species, the [[Chinese paddlefish]], [[kaluga sturgeon]] and [[Yangtze sturgeon]], have not been reported from the Yellow River basin in about 50 years.&lt;ref name=Xie2018/&gt;&lt;!-- for species list, see &quot;Supporting Information&quot; in Xie2018 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fishes_YR2015&quot;/&gt; Other species that support important fisheries include [[white Amur bream]], [[ayu]], [[Siniperca chuatsi|mandarin fish]], ''[[Protosalanx]]'' icefish, [[northern snakehead]], [[Asian swamp eel]] and others.&lt;ref name=Xie2018/&gt;&lt;!-- for species list, see &quot;Supporting Information&quot; in Xie2018 --&gt;

===Aquaculture===
[[File:Chinemys reevesii 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese pond turtle]] (shown) and [[Chinese softshell turtle]] are both native to the Yellow River, but also [[Turtle farming|farmed]] in large numbers]]

The Yellow River is generally less suitable for [[Aquaculture in China|aquaculture]] than the rivers of [[Central China|central]] and [[South China|southern China]], such as the [[Yangtze]] or the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], but aquaculture is also practiced in some areas along the Yellow River. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in [[Xingyang]] City, upstream from [[Zhengzhou]]. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside [[Wangcun, Xingyang|Wangcun]] Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 ''[[mu (unit)|mu]]'' (10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), making the town the largest aquaculture center in [[North China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zgnyqss.com/news/zonghe/2011/0930/95767.html |script-title=zh:黄河畔的荥阳市万亩鱼塘 |trans-title=Ten thousand of ''mu'' of fish ponds in the riverside Xingyang |website=zgnyqss.com |language=zh-hans |date=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, construction started in [[Wangcun, Xingyang|Wangcun]], [[Henan]] on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zynews.com/town/2007-07/24/content_459017.htm |script-title=zh:荥阳开建河南省最大黄河鳖养殖基地 |trans-title=Construction started in Xingyang on the province's largest Yellow River Turtle farm |website=zynews.com |language=zh-hans |date=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge, entirely aquatic [[Chinese giant salamander]], a species that has declined drastically due primarily to persecution for food and [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medicine]], is native to the Yellow River and other Chinese rivers. It is farmed in large numbers in several parts of China and genetic studies have revealed that the captive stock mostly is of Yellow River origin.

==Pollution==
{{see also|Water pollution in China}}
On 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' filed a report &quot;China's Mother River: the Yellow River&quot;, claiming that [[Water pollution in China|severe pollution]] has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/25/water-china|title= One-third of China's Yellow River 'unfit for drinking or agriculture' Factory waste and sewage from growing cities has severely polluted major waterway, according to Chinese research|author=Branigan, Tania  |date=25 November 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]] had surveyed more than {{convert|8384|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than &quot;level five&quot; according to the criteria used by the [[UN Environment Program]].{{dubious|no river on Earth is that long|date=March 2013}} Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture. The report said waste and sewage discharged into the system last year totaled 4.29b tons. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources.{{which|date=October 2011}}

==In culture==
[[File:Qikou.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Qikou town along Yellow River in [[Shanxi]] Province]]
In ancient times, it was [[Chinese mythology|believed]] that the Yellow River flowed from [[Tian|Heaven]] as a continuation of the [[Milky Way]]. In a Chinese legend, [[Zhang Qian]] is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yen Chün-p'ing. When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl ([[Vega]]), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a [[Classical planet|wandering star]] interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd ([[Altair]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CBDChangChenchou&quot;&gt;{{ChineseBioDict|Chang Chên-chou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provinces of [[Hebei]] and [[Henan]] derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, &quot;North of the River&quot; and &quot;South of the River&quot;, although the border between them is never stable historically and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River but the [[Zhang River]] instead.

;Mother river, China's Sorrow, and cradle of Chinese civilization.
Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as &quot;the Mother River&quot; and &quot;the cradle of the Chinese civilization&quot;.
During the long [[history of China]], the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both &quot;China's Pride&quot; and &quot;China's Sorrow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Linsun and Brown, Kerry (2009) ''Berkshire encyclopedia of China'', Berkshire Publishing Group, p. 1125 {{ISBN|978-0-9770159-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;When the Yellow River flows clear.
Sometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the &quot;Muddy Flow&quot; ({{zh|first=t|labels=no|s={{linktext|浊|流}}|t={{linktext|濁|流}}|p={{linktext|Zhuó| Liú}}}}). The Chinese idiom &quot;when the Yellow River flows clear&quot; is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression &quot;when pigs fly&quot;.

&quot;The Yellow River running clear&quot;  was reported as a good omen during the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]], along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as ''[[qilin]]'' (an African giraffe brought to China by a [[Bengal]] embassy aboard [[Zheng He]]'s ships in 1414) and ''[[zouyu]]'' (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=duy&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Yellow Sea''' is a [[marginal sea]] of the [[Western Pacific Ocean]] located between [[mainland China]] and the [[Korean Peninsula]], and can be considered the northwestern part of the [[East China Sea]].  It is one of four seas named after common [[colour term]]s (the others being the [[Black Sea]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[White Sea]]), and its name is descriptive of the phenomenon whereby fine sand grains from the [[Gobi Desert]] [[sand storm]]s, that descend annually from the north, turn the surface of its waters a golden yellow.

The innermost bay of northwestern Yellow Sea is called the [[Bohai Sea]] (previously Pechihli Bay or Chihli Bay), into which flow some of the most important rivers of [[northern China]], such as the [[Yellow River]] (through [[Shandong]] province and its capital [[Jinan]]), the [[Hai River]] (through [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]) and the [[Liao River]] (through [[Liaoning]] province). [[Sand]] and [[silt]] carried down by these rivers contribute further to the sea's colour.  The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the [[Korea Bay]], into which flow the [[Yalu River]], the [[Chongchon River]] and the [[Taedong River]].

Since 1 November 2018, the Yellow Sea has also served as the location of &quot;peace zones&quot; between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name=nov1 /&gt;

==Geography==
===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Yellow Sea (which it also names as &quot;Hwang Hai&quot;) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas|edition=3rd|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Yellow Sea is separated from the [[Sea of Japan]] by the boundary from the southern end of [[Haenam]] Peninsula in [[Jeollanamdo]] to [[Jeju Island]] and divided into the [[East China Sea]] by the boundary from the west end of [[Jeju Island]] to the [[Yangtze River]] estuary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Physiography===
[[File:DustStyormYellowSea2March2008.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of a dust storm over East Asia on 2 March 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8477 Sand storm over Yellow Sea], nasa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Yellow Sea, excluding the Bohai, extends by about {{convert|960|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south and about {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west; it has an area of approximately {{convert|380000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a volume of about {{convert|17000|km3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article039304.html Yellow Sea], [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Its depth is only {{convert|44|m|abbr=on}} on average, with a maximum of {{convert|152|m|abbr=on}}. The sea is a flooded section of continental shelf that formed after the last ice age (some 10,000 years ago) as sea levels rose {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}} to their current levels. The depth gradually increases from north to south.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; The sea bottom and shores are dominated by sand and silt brought by the rivers through the Bohai Sea ([[Liao River]], [[Yellow River]], [[Hai He]]) and the Korea Bay ([[Yalu River]]). These deposits, together with sand storms are responsible for the yellowish colour of the water referenced in the sea's name.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/652686/Yellow-Sea Yellow Sea], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

Major islands of the sea include [[Anmado]], [[Baengnyeongdo]], [[Daebudo]], [[Deokjeokdo]], [[Gageodo]], [[Ganghwado]], [[Hauido]], [[Heuksando]], [[Hongdo]], [[Jejudo]], [[Jindo (island)|Jindo]], [[Muuido]], [[Sido (island)|Sido]], [[Silmido]], [[Sindo (island)|Sindo]], [[Wando (island)|Wando]], [[Yeongjongdo]] and [[Yeonpyeongdo]] (all in South Korea).

===Climate and hydrology===
The area has cold, dry winters with strong northerly [[monsoon]]s blowing from late November to March. Average January temperatures are {{convert|-10|°C}} in the north and {{convert|3|°C}} in the south. Summers are wet and warm with frequent typhoons between June and October.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; Air temperatures range between {{convert|10|and|28|°C|°F}}. The average annual precipitation increases from about {{convert|500|mm|abbr=on}} in the north to {{convert|1000|mm|abbr=on}} in the south. [[Fog]] is frequent along the coasts, especially in the upwelling cold-water areas.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The sea has a warm cyclone current, forming part of the [[Kuroshio Current]], which diverges near the western part of Japan and flows northward into the Yellow Sea at the speed of below {{convert|0.8|km/h|abbr=on}}. Southward currents prevail near the sea coast, especially in the winter monsoon period.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

[[File:Yellow Sea, February 24, 2015.jpg|thumb|Brown sediment spills out into the Yellow Sea from rivers in eastern China and Korea. The nutrients in the sediment may be responsible for the bloom of [[phytoplankton]] seen as blue-green swirls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3289 Sediments and Phytoplankton bloom near the Mouth of the Yangtze, East China Sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630015155/http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=3289 |date=30 June 2010 }}, NASA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The water temperature is close to freezing in the northern part in winter, so drift ice patches and continuous ice fields form and hinder navigation between November and March. The water temperature and salinity are homogeneous across the depth. The southern waters are warmer at {{convert|6|–|8|°C|°F}}. In spring and summer, the upper layer is warmed up by the sun and diluted by the fresh water from rivers, while the deeper water remains cold and saline. This deep water stagnates and slowly moves south. Commercial bottom-dwelling fishes are found around this mass of water, especially at its southern part. Summer temperatures range between {{convert|22|and|28|°C|°F}}. The average salinity is relatively low, at 30[[parts per thousand|‰]] in the north to 33–34‰ in the south, dropping to 26‰ or lower near the river deltas. In the southwest monsoon season (June to August) the increased rainfall and runoff further reduce the salinity of the upper sea layer.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Water transparency increases from about {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} in the north up to {{convert|45|m|sp=us}} in the south.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

[[Tide]]s are semidiurnal, i.e. rise twice a day. Their amplitude varies between about {{convert|0.9|and|3|m|ft|sp=us}} at the coast of China. Tides are higher at the Korean Peninsula, typically ranging between {{convert|4|and|8|m|sp=us}} and reaching the maximum in spring. The tidal system rotates in a counterclockwise direction. The speed of the tidal current is generally less than {{convert|1.6|km/h|abbr=on}} in the middle of the sea, but may increase to more than {{convert|5.6|km/h|abbr=on}} near the coasts.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; The fastest tides reaching {{convert|20|km/h|abbr=on}} occur in the Myeongnyang Strait between the [[Jindo Island]] and the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref name=king&gt;M. J. King, et al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XYlVPmR34YsC&amp;pg=PA175 Twinning of Jindo Grand Bridge, Republic of Korea] in Current and future trends in bridge design, construction and maintenance 2: safety, economy, sustainability and aesthetics; proceedings of the international conference organized by the Institution of Civil Engineers and held in Hong Kong on 25–26 April 2001 {{ISBN|0-7277-3091-6}} pp. 175, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea is rich in seaweed (predominantly [[kelp]], ''Laminaria japonica''), [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[shellfish]], [[clam]]s, and especially in [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]] which bloom in summer and contribute to the water color (see image above). For example, the seaweed production in the area was as high as 1.5 million tonnes in 1979 for China alone. The abundance of all these plant and animal species increases toward the south and indicates a high sea productivity, accounting for the diversity of fish species and high fish yield from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Chikuni, pp. 8, 16, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Several species of [[Gobiidae|goby]] new to science have been discovered recently in the Yellow Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Earth_from_Space_The_Yellow_Sea_of_China|title=Earth from Space: The Yellow Sea of China|last=esa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern part of the Yellow Sea, including the entire west coast of [[Korea]], contains a {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide}} belt of [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] [[mudflat]]s, which has the total area of {{convert|2850|km2|abbr=on}} and is maintained by {{convert|4|–|10|m|abbr=on}}. Those flats consist of highly productive sediments with a rich benthic fauna and are of great importance for [[bird migration|migratory]] [[wader]]s and shorebirds.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice L.

The coasts of the Yellow Sea are very densely populated, at approximately {{convert|250|PD/km2|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; The sea waters had been used for fishing by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese ships for centuries. Especially rich in fish are the bottom layers. About 200 fish species are exploited commercially, especially [[Sparidae|sea bream]], [[Sciaenidae|croaker]]s, [[Synodontidae|lizard fishes]], [[prawn]]s, [[cutlassfish]], [[Japanese horse mackerel|horse mackerel]], squid, [[eel]], [[filefish]], [[Pacific herring]], [[chub mackerel]], [[flounder]]&lt;ref&gt;Chikuni, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and jellyfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/chinas-jellyfish-hauling-mules-dying-breed/|title=China's jellyfish-hauling mules a dying breed|last=AFP|first=Agence France-Presse|date=22 November 2016|website=www.atimes.com|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of fishing has been gradually increasing for China and Korea and decreasing for Japan. For example, the production volumes for China rose from 619,000 tonnes in 1985 to 1,984,400 tonnes in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.noaa.gov/retiredsites/china/fishing.htm Fishing Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527120320/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/retiredsites/china/fishing.htm |date=27 May 2010 }}, noaa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; All species are overfished, however, and while the total catchments are rising, the fish population is continuously declining for most species.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chikuni, pp. 37, 47, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Navigation is another traditional activity in the Yellow Sea. The main Chinese ports are [[Dalian]], [[Tianjin]], [[Qingdao]] and [[Qinhuangdao]]. The major South Korean ports on the Yellow Sea are [[Incheon]], [[Gunsan]] and [[Mokpo]], and that for North Korea is [[Nampho]], the outport of [[Pyongyang]]. The [[Bohai Train Ferry]] provides a shortcut between the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Shandong]].&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; A major naval accident occurred on 24 November 1999 at [[Yantai]], [[Shandong]], China when the 9,000-ton Chinese ferry ''Dashun'' caught fire and capsized in rough seas. About 300 people were killed making it the worst maritime incident in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ferry-sinks-in-yellow-sea-killing-hundreds Ferry sinks in Yellow Sea, killing hundreds], 24 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil exploration has been successful in the Chinese and North Korean portions of the sea, with the proven and estimated reserves of about 9 and 20 billion tonnes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsru.com/finance/03may2007/bohajvan.html China found new large oil field in the Yellow Sea], News.ru, 3 May 2007 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study and exploration of the sea is somewhat hindered by insufficient sharing of information between the involved countries. China initiated collaborations with foreign oil companies in 1979, but this initiative declined later.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

A major oil spill occurred on 16 July 2010 when a pipeline exploded at the north-east port of [[Dalian]], causing a wide-scale fire and spreading about 1,500 tonnes of oil over the sea area of {{convert|430|km2|abbr=on}}. The port had been closed and fishing suspended until the end of August. Eight hundred fishing boats and 40 specialized vessels were mobilized to relieve the environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/21/china-oil-spill-disaster-wildlife China's worst-ever oil spill threatens wildlife as volunteers assist in clean-up], Guardian, 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yellow Sea is considered among the most degraded marine areas on earth.&lt;ref name = UNDP&gt;UNDP/GEF. (2007) The Yellow Sea: Analysis of Environmental Status and Trends. p. 408, Ansan, Republic of Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of natural coastal habitats due to [[land reclamation]] has resulted in the destruction of more than 60% of tidal wetlands around the Yellow Sea coastline in approximately 50 years.&lt;ref name = Murray &gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray N.

In addition to [[land reclamation]], the Yellow Sea ecosystem is facing several other serious environmental problems. Pollution is widespread and deterioration of pelagic and benthic habitat quality has occurred, and harmful algal blooms frequently occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = China's largest algal bloom turns the Yellow Sea green| url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/04/china-algal-bloom-yellow-sea-green | newspaper = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invasion of [[introduced species]] are having a detrimental effect on the Yellow Sea environment. There are 25 intentionally introduced species and 9 unintentionally introduced species in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem.&lt;ref name = UNDP/&gt; Declines of biodiversity, fisheries and ecosystem services in the Yellow Sea are widespread.&lt;ref name = UNDP/&gt;

The tidal flats of the Yellow Sea are considered endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;MurrayMa2015&quot;/&gt;

==Location of Korean Peace Zones==
On 1 November 2018, officials from South Korea's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that &quot;peace zones&quot; had been established by the North and South Korean militaries in the Yellow Sea area that touches the North and South Korean demarcation line.&lt;ref name=nov1&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20181101002500315 | title=Koreas halt all 'hostile' military acts near border| date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A buffer zone was also created in the Yellow Sea's [[Northern Limit Line]] (NLL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tellerreport.com/news/--%5Bfile%5D-nll-buffer-zone--there-is-a-marine-corps--.BkJ1sMYnm.html|title=[File] NLL buffer zone, there is a Marine Corps. &amp;#124; tellerreport.com|website=www.tellerreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

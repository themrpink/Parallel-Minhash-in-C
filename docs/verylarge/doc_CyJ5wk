The World Fairs are known for bringing new technology, innovation, and scientific discoveries to the average person. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, many of the inventions displayed were precursors to items which have become an integral part of today's culture. Novel applications of electricity and light waves for communication and medical use were displayed in the Palace of Electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924015340114#page/n209/mode/2up|title=The Official Guide Book to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition|last=Lowenstein|first=M.

=== Communication contributions ===
'''Wireless telephone''' '''–''' The &quot;wireless telephony&quot; unit or &quot;radiophone&quot; installed at the St. Louis World Fair was a thing of wonder to the crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Music or spoken messages were transmitted from an apparatus within the Palace of Electricity to a telephone receiver out in the courtyard. The receiver, which was attached to nothing, when placed to the ear allowed a visitor to hear the transmission. This radiophone, invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], consisted of a transmitter which transformed sound waves into light waves and a receiver which converted the light waves back into sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048683098;view=1up;seq=9|title=Wireless Telephony|last=Collins|first=A.

'''Early fax machine''' '''–''' The [[telautograph]], the precursor to the modern day [[Fax|fax machine]], was invented in 1888 by the American scientist, [[Elisha Gray]] who at one point in time contested Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Elisha_Gray|title=Elisha Gray|website=Ohio History Central|access-date=13 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115140004/http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Elisha_Gray|archive-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telautograph was a device which could send electrical impulses to the receiving pen of the device, in order to be able to recreate drawings to a piece of paper while a person simultaneously wrote them longhand on the other end of the device. In 1900, Gray's assistant, Foster Ritchie, improved upon the original design, and it was this device that was displayed at the 1904 World's Fair and marketed for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and its Predecessors in the United States|last=Coe|first=Lewis|publisher=McFarland and Company, Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-89950-736-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/telegraphhistory0000coel/page/20 20]|via=www.deadmedia.org|url=https://archive.org/details/telegraphhistory0000coel/page/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical contributions ===
'''Finsen light''' '''–''' The Finsen light, a phototherapy unit invented by [[Niels Ryberg Finsen]], utilized ultraviolet light to treat a form of lupus caused by the bacteria ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1903 for his contributions and his invention pioneered the way which led to many other forms of radiation therapy in the treatment of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/health/topics/79/Finsen-light.html|title=Finsen Light|website=faq.org|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|access-date=13 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115135946/http://www.faqs.org/health/topics/79/Finsen-light.html|archive-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-ray machine''' '''–''' The [[X-ray generator|X-ray machine]] was an invention that had its public debut at the 1904 World's Fair. X-rays were first discovered in November 1895 by a German scientist, [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], who at the time was studying the phenomena accompanying the passage of an electric current through a gas of extremely low pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/rontgen-bio.html|title=Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen - Biographical|date=2014|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=13 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120234908/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/rontgen-bio.html|archive-date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rontgen's discovery, he took an x-ray of his wife's hand, showing the bones and her fingers along with her wedding ring, and sent it to several of his scientist colleagues. One of the scientists that learned of the discovery was [[Thomas Edison]] and he soon began to experiment with his own x-ray machine with his assistant [[Clarence Madison Dally|Clarence Dally]]. In 1901, Dally brought a test version of the X-ray machine to the 1901 World's Fair but failed to test the machine when [[Assassination of William McKinley|President McKinley was assassinated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=/history/clarence-dally-the-man-who-gave-thomas-edison-x-ray-vision-123713565/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818192816/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ist/?next=%2Fhistory%2Fclarence-dally-the-man-who-gave-thomas-edison-x-ray-vision-123713565%2F|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-08-18|title=Clarence Dally — The Man Who Gave Thomas Edison X-Ray Vision|last=King|first=Gilbert|date=14 March 2012|website=smithsonianmag.com|access-date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1904 World's Fair, the X-ray machine was perfected and successfully shown to the public. X-rays are now commonplace in hospitals and airports.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

'''Infant incubator''' '''–''' Although [[Neonatal intensive care unit#Incubator|infant incubators]] were invented in the year 1888 by Drs. Alan M. Thomas and William Champion, these devices were not immediately widely used. To increase awareness of the benefits these units provided, infant incubators containing premature babies were displayed at the [[Brussels International Exposition (1897)|1897]], [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition|1898]], [[Pan-American Exposition|1901]], and 1904 World Fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Incubator Graduates|date=6 August 1904|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|newspaper=Harper's Weekly|editor-last=Harvey|editor-first=George|location=New York|page=1225|via=harpweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This piece of medical equipment helped neonates with compromised immune systems by providing a sanitary environment to reduce the likelihood of acquiring an infection. Each incubator was an air-tight glass box with a metal frame. Hot air was pumped into the container to keep a constant temperature. Newspapers advertised the incubators with &quot;lives are being preserved by this wonderful method.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atthefair.homestead.com/pkeatt/Babyincubators.html|title=Baby Incubators|last=Gaskins|first=Lee|date=2008|website=At The Fair: The 1904 St Louis World Fair|access-date=13 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510101238/http://atthefair.homestead.com/pkeatt/Babyincubators.html|archive-date=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the World Fair in 1904, E. M. Bayliss brought these devices for exhibition on The Pike where approximately ten nurses cared for twenty-four neo-natal babies while in the infant incubators.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://source.wustl.edu/2004/04/xrays-fax-machines-and-ice-cream-cones-debut-at-1904-world-fair/|title=X-rays, 'fax machines' and ice cream cones debut at 1904 World's Fair|last=Lutz|first=Diana|date=7 April 2004|website=Washington University in St. Louis: the Source|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115134317/https://source.wustl.edu/2004/04/xrays-fax-machines-and-ice-cream-cones-debut-at-1904-world-fair/|archive-date=November 15, 2016|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The exhibit required an entrance fee of twenty-five cents and visitors could also purchase souvenirs and refreshments from the adjoining shop and café. These proceeds, totaling $181,632, helped to fund Bayliss's project.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; There were some setbacks with the infant incubator display as the sanitary conditions were not always consistent and some babies died of illness. The incubator area was then modified by installing glass walls to separate the babies from visitors, thus decreasing the exposure of the infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webpages.charter.net/mtruax/1904wf/home.html|title=Infant Incubators|last=Truax|first=Mike|date=October 2009|website=Mike's 1904 St. Louis World's Fair|access-date=13 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824131950/http://webpages.charter.net/mtruax/1904wf/home.html|archive-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science and technology behind the incubators has since been expanded upon. Now known as &quot;isolettes,&quot; these units are a vital component to caring for neonates in modern [[Neonatal intensive care unit#Equipment|neonatal intensive care units]].

=== Transportation contributions ===
'''Electric streetcar''' '''–''' Although street railways had been in use in North America since the early 19th century, [[History of trams#Electric trams|electric street railcars]] were still relatively novel at the time of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Outside of the Palace of Electricity, an exhibit including a working electric street car and 1400 feet of track demonstrated the speed, acceleration, and braking capacities of this new-powered model.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Electric railways for inner-city transport are still used in many cities today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

'''Personal automobile''' '''–''' One of the most popular attractions of the Exposition was contained in the Palace of Transportation: [[Car|automobiles]] and motor cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The automobile display contained 140 models including [[History of the automobile|ones powered by gasoline, steam, and electricity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; The private automobile first made its public debut at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Four years after the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the [[Ford Motor Company]] began producing the [[Ford Model T]] making the personal automobile more affordable. Since that time, the automobile has increased in popularity, advanced in technology, and expanded the mobility of humanity. A prototype [[Vehicle audio|car radio]] was also demonstrated by inventor [[Lee de Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/first_car_radios_history_and_development_of_early_car_radios.html Radiomuseum.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913192315/http://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/first_car_radios_history_and_development_of_early_car_radios.html |date=2017-09-13 }} Accessed February 16, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airplane –''' The 1904 World's Fair hosted the first-ever &quot;Airship Contest&quot; since aerial navigation was still in its infancy at this time. The Exposition offered a grand prize of $100,000 to the airship or other flying machine with the best time through a course marked out by stationary air balloons while travelling at least 15 miles per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Although none were able to earn the grand prize, the contest did witness the first public [[Airship|dirigible]] flight in America as well as numerous other flights made by various airships. This was the first major event in a [[History of St. Louis|history of aviation in St. Louis]] leading to the city's nickname, Flight City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mohistory.org/exhibitions/audio/82?ctx=/exhibitions/online/82/|title=Flight City: St. Louis Takes to the Air|website=mohistory.org|publisher=Missouri History Museum|access-date=2016-12-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121621/http://mohistory.org/exhibitions/audio/82?ctx=%2Fexhibitions%2Fonline%2F82%2F|archive-date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of aerial navigation continued to develop and has been mastered since the 1904 Exposition.

== Legacy ==
Since many people were curious about this up and coming city, many reporters and photographers attended the World's Fair to document and understand the city. What they found was nothing like anyone else could have imagined. The streets were buzzing with activity, with many of its citizens constantly on the &quot;go&quot; and the streets &quot;crowded with activity&quot;.  One observer remarked that, at this time, St. Louis had more energy in its streets than any other Northern Street did.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis and the World's fair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=St. Louis and the World's Fair|publisher=L.H.

With more and more people interested in the city, St. Louis government and architects were primarily concerned with their ports and access to the city.  Though transportation by water had always been important to the city (St. Louis had originated as a trading post), it was becoming even more important that the port be open, but efficient for all visitors. It also needed to show off some of the city's flair and excitement, which is why in many photographs one sees photos of St. Louis' skyscrapers in the background.  In addition to a functioning port, the [[Eads Bridge]] was constructed, which was considered one of St. Louis' &quot;sights&quot;.  1627 feet long, it connected Missouri and Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis and the World's fair&quot;/&gt; [[File:Louisiana Purchase Exposition East Lagoon.jpg|thumb|left|East Lagoon, statue of Saint Louis, Palaces of Education and Manufacture, and wireless telegraph tower.]]

As with the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893, all but one of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition's grand, neo-Classical exhibition palaces were temporary structures, designed to last but a year or two. They were built with a material called &quot;[[Staff (building material)|staff]],&quot; a mixture of [[plaster|plaster of Paris]] and [[hemp]] fibers, on a wood frame. As at the Chicago World's Fair, buildings and statues deteriorated during the months of the Fair and had to be patched.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

The Palace of Fine Art, designed by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], featured a grand interior sculpture court based on the Roman [[Baths of Caracalla]]. Standing at the top of Art Hill, it now serves as the home of the [[Saint Louis Art Museum|St. Louis Art Museum]].{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

The Administration Building, designed by [[Cope &amp; Stewardson]], is now [[Brookings Hall]], the defining landmark on the campus of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]]. A similar building was erected at [[Northwest Missouri State University]] founded in 1905 in [[Maryville, Missouri]]. The grounds' layout was also recreated in Maryville and now is designated as the official Missouri State Arboretum.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

[[File:04Creation.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the exhibit &quot;Creation&quot; on the Pike, a spectacle portraying the first 6 days in the [[Book of Genesis]]. This exhibit was dismantled and moved to [[Coney Island]]'s [[Dreamland (Coney Island, 1904)|Dreamland amusement park]] at the end of the fair.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Immerso, Coney Island: The People's Playground, Rutgers University Press, 2002, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some mansions from the Exposition's era survive along Lindell Boulevard at the north border of Forest Park.
[[File:1904 Flight Cage.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Flight Cage ([[Aviary]])]]
The huge bird cage at the [[Saint Louis Zoological Park]], dates to the fair. A [[St. Louis Jain temple|Jain temple]] carved out of teak stood within the Indian Pavilion near the [[Ferris Wheel]]. It was dismantled after the exhibition and was reconstructed in Las Vegas at the [[Castaways (casino)|Castaways]] hotel. It has recently been reassembled and is now on display at the [[Jain Center of Southern California]] at Los Angeles. [[Birmingham, Alabama]]'s iconic [[cast iron]] [[Vulcan statue]] was first exhibited at the Fair in the Palace of Mines and Metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitvulcan.com/about/vulcans-story/|title=Vulcan's Story &amp;#124; Vulcan Park &amp; Museum: Birmingham, AL|access-date=2018-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808203129/http://visitvulcan.com/about/vulcans-story/|archive-date=2018-08-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missouri State building was the largest of the state buildings, as Missouri was the host state. Though it had sections with marble floors and heating and air conditioning, it was planned to be a temporary structure. However, it burned the night of November 18–19, just eleven days before the Fair was to end. Most of the interior was destroyed, but some contents were rescued without damage, including some furniture and much of the contents of the fair's Model Library. Since the fair was almost over, the building was not rebuilt. After the fair, the current World's Fair Pavilion in Forest Park was built on the site of the Missouri building with profits from the fair in 1909–10.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

[[File:ConsoleOrgueWanamaker.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The organ's present six–[[manual (music)|manual]] console, installed in 1928.]]
Festival Hall, designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] and used for large-scale musical pageants, contained the largest [[organ (music)|organ]] in the world at the time, built by the [[Los Angeles Art Organ Company]] (which went bankrupt as a result). The great organ was debuted by the fair's official organist, [[Charles Henry Galloway]]. Though the opening concert was scheduled for the first day of the fair, complications related to its construction resulted in the opening concert being postponed until June 9. After the fair, the organ was placed into storage, and eventually purchased by [[John Wanamaker]] for his new [[Wanamaker's]] store in [[Philadelphia]] where it was tripled in size and became known as the [[Wanamaker Organ]]. The famous Bronze Eagle in the Wanamaker Store also came from the Fair. It features hundreds of hand-forged bronze feathers and was the centerpiece of one of the many German exhibits. [[Wanamaker's]] became a [[Lord &amp; Taylor]] store and more recently, a [[Macy's]] store.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Completed in 1913, the Jefferson Memorial building was built near the main entrance to the Exposition, at Lindell and DeBalivere. It was built with proceeds from the fair, to commemorate [[Thomas Jefferson]], who initiated the Louisiana Purchase, as was the first memorial to the third President. It became the headquarters of the [[Missouri History Museum]], and stored the Exposition's records and archives when the Louisiana Purchase Exposition company completed its mission. The building is now home to the Missouri History Museum, and the museum was significantly expanded in 2002–3.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

The [[Maine|State of Maine Building]], which was a rustic cabin, was transported to [[Point Lookout, Missouri]] where it overlooked the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] by sportsmen who formed the Maine Hunting and Fishing Club. In 1915, when the main building at the [[College of the Ozarks]] in [[Forsyth, Missouri]] burned, the school relocated to Point Lookout, where the Maine building was renamed the Dobyns Building in honor of a school president. The Dobyns Building burned in 1930 and the college's signature church was built in its place. In 2004, a replica of the Maine building was built on the campus. The Keeter Center is named for another school president.

The [[observation tower]] erected by the [[Lee de Forest#American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company|American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company]] was brought to the Fair when it became a hazard near Niagara Falls and needed to be removed because in the wintertime, ice from the fall's mist would form on the steel structure, and eventually fall onto the buildings below.  It served as a communications platform for Lee DeForest's work in wireless telegraphy and a platform to view the fair.  As Niagara Falls was near Buffalo New York, it was also called the Buffalo Tower&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1904df.htm|title=De Forest Wireless Telegraphy Tower: Bulletin #1 (1904)|website=earlyradiohistory.us|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the World's Fair, it was moved to Creve Coeur Lake to be part of that park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlouisco.com/Portals/8/docs/Document%20Library/parks/PDFs/ParkHistory/CreveCoeurHistory.pdf|title=Creve Coeur Park History|last=Truax|first=Mike|date=2010|website=St. Louis County, MO|access-date=25 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604161444/https://www.stlouisco.com/Portals/8/docs/Document%20Library/parks/PDFs/ParkHistory/CreveCoeurHistory.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduction of new foods ===
A number of foods are claimed to have been invented at the fair. The most popular claim is that the waffle-style [[ice cream cone]] was invented and first sold during the fair. However, it is widely believed that it was not invented at the Fair, but instead, it was popularized at the Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IceCream/IceCreamCone.htm|title=History of Ice Cream Cone|last=Stradley|first=Linda|publisher=What's Cooking America|access-date=2008-05-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509190148/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IceCream/IceCreamCone.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicfood.com/Ice%20Cream%20Cone.htm|title=An 1807 Ice Cream Cone: Discovery and Evidence|last=Weir|first=Robert|publisher=Historic Food|access-date=2008-05-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517100822/http://www.historicfood.com/Ice%20Cream%20Cone.htm|archive-date=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other claims are more dubious, including the [[hamburger]] and [[hot dog]] (both traditional [[United States|American]] foods), [[peanut butter]], [[iced tea]],&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, Pamela. 2004. Beyond the ice cream cone: the whole scoop on food at the 1904 World's Fair. St. Louis: Enid Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cotton candy]]. It is more likely, however, that these food items were first introduced to mass audiences and popularized by the fair. [[Dr Pepper#Overview and history|Dr Pepper]] and [[Puffed Wheat]] cereal were first introduced to a national audience at the fair. Daughter of slaves, [[Annie Fisher]], brought her beaten biscuits, which were already famous in her hometown of [[Columbia, Missouri]]. The exposition awarded Fisher's biscuits a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubhtml5.com/fcrm/dgwq/basic|title=Columbia's Historic Sharp End 2015 Pages 1 - 50 - Text Version - PubHTML5|last=pubhtml5.com|website=pubhtml5.com|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would later be enjoyed by President [[William Howard Taft]] on his 1911 visit to Missouri.

Though not the debut as many foods as claimed, the fair offered what was essentially America's first food court. Visitors could sample a variety of fast foods, dine in dozens of restaurants, or just stroll through the mile-long pike where food was celebrated.  As one historian said of the fair, ''one could breakfast in France, take a mid-morning snack in the Philippines, lunch in Italy, and dine in Japan.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treat Me In St. Louis|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/11/23/treat-me-in-st-louis|website=The Attic|access-date=4 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on popular music ===
The fair inspired the song &quot;[[Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis]]&quot;, which was recorded by many artists, including [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]]. Both the fair and the song are focal points of the 1944 feature film ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' starring [[Judy Garland]], which also inspired a [[Meet Me in St. Louis (musical)|Broadway musical version]]. [[Scott Joplin]] wrote the rag &quot;Cascades&quot; in honor of the elaborate waterfalls in front of Festival Hall.

Following the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[1898 Treaty of Paris|peace treaty]] granted the [[United States]] control over [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. Puerto Rico had had a quasi-autonomous government as an &quot;overseas province&quot; of Spain, and the Philippines, having declared independence after the 1896-1899 [[Philippine Revolution]], fought US annexation in the 1899-1902 [[Philippine–American War]]. These areas [[Treaty of Paris (1898)#U.S. ratification of the treaty in the Senate|controversially]] became [[unincorporated territories of the United States]] in 1899, and people were brought from these territories to be on &quot;display&quot; at the 1904 fair.

1,102 [[Filipinos]] were displayed at the fair, 700 of them [[Philippine Scouts]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]], used for controlling conflict among Filipinos and between Filipinos and fair organizers. Displays included the [[Apache]] of the [[American Southwest]] and the [[Igorot]] of the Philippines, both of which peoples were noted as &quot;primitive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering St. Louis, 1904: A World on Display and Bontoc Eulogy|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Zwick, Jim|date=4 March 1996|access-date=2007-05-25|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610034510/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html|archive-date=June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Philippine reservation, was a school which was actively teaching Igorot students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Love |first=Robertus |date=May 1904 |title=Filipino School at World's Fair |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgZRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Miss+Zamora+st+louis+filipino&amp;pg=PA422 |magazine=The School News and Pratical Educator |access-date=3 March 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine reservation at the exposition cost $1.1 million to create and operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kennedy |first=Richard |date=1998 |title=Rethinking the Philippine Exhibit at the 1904 St. Louis World's fair |url=https://folklife-media.si.edu/docs/festival/program-book-articles/FESTBK1998_14.pdf |magazine=Smithsonian Folklife Festival |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=3 March 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, members of the Southeast Alaskan [[Tlingit]] tribe accompanied fourteen [[totem poles]], two Native houses, and a canoe displayed at the Alaska Exhibit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrick&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=The Most Striking of Objects: The Totem Poles of Sitka National Historical Park|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Interior]]|author=Patrick, Andrew| year=2009|pages=75–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Mary Benson, a noted [[Pomo]] basket weaver whose work is curated at the Smithsonian Institution and [[National Museum of the American Indian]], attended to demonstrate her basket making skills which are described as astounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bibby| first = Brian| year = 2012| title = Essential Art: Native Basketry from the California Indian Heritage Center| publisher = Heydey Books| location = Berkeley| isbn = 978-0-930588-80-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletic events such as a basketball tournament were held to demonstrate the success of the [[American Indian boarding schools|Indian Boarding Schools]] and other assimilation programs.&lt;ref&gt;Parezo, Nancy J. &quot;A &quot;Special Olympics&quot;: Testing Racial Strength and Endurance at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition&quot;.

It has been argued that the &quot;overriding purpose of the fair really centered on an effort to promote America's new role as an overseas imperial power&quot;, and that &quot;While the juxtaposition of &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; buttressed assumptions of racial superiority, representations of Native American and Filipino life created an impression of continuity between westward expansion across the continent and the new overseas empire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwick&quot;/&gt; [[Racializing]] concepts and epithets used domestically were extended to the people of the overseas territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Savage Acts: Wars, Fairs and Empire|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Zwick, Jim|date=November 7, 1995|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610034510/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html|archive-date=June 10, 2007|access-date=May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/09/the-1904-st-louis-worlds-fair-photos/597658/|title=The 1904 St. Louis World's Fair: Photos - The Atlantic|last=Taylor|first=Alan|website=theatlantic.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ota Benga]], a Congolese Pygmy, was featured at the fair. Later he was given the run of the grounds at the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York, then featured in an exhibit on evolution alongside an [[orangutan]] in 1906, but public protest ended that.

A 150,000 square foot garden, set on the hillside south of the Machinery Hall and Engine House, featured a replica of Kyoto's famous [[Kinkakuji]], showing Japan's ancient sophistication, and a [[Formosa]] Mansion and Tea House, showing her modern colonial efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Hoshi, ''Handbook of Japan and Japanese Exhibits at World's Fair'' (St. Louis: Hajime Hoshi, 1904), 112.[https://archive.org/details/handbookjapanan00unkngoog/page/n118/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; A second exhibition, &quot;Fair Japan on the 'Pike',&quot; organized by [[Kushibiki Yumindo|Kushibiki and Arai]], welcomed the public through a large [[Niōmon]]-style gate into a realm of geisha-staffed exotic Japanese consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshi, ''Handbook of Japan and Japanese Exhibits at World's Fair'', 125.[https://archive.org/details/handbookjapanan00unkngoog/page/n130/mode/2up] Hoshi also claimed the original gate had been &quot;erected about 300 years ago ... in the Province of [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hidachi]] by Lord [[Satake clan|Satake]] Giobu-Tayu in memory of his father.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibits ===
After the fair was completed, many of the international exhibits were not returned to their country of origin, but were dispersed to museums in the United States. For example, the Philippine exhibits were acquired by the [[Iowa Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. The [[Vulcan statue]] is today a prominent feature of the Vulcan Park and Museum in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], where it was originally cast.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] coordinated the U.S. government exhibits. It featured a blue whale, the first full-cast of a [[blue whale]] ever created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnh.si.edu/onehundredyears/profiles/Whales_SI.html &quot;History of Smithsonian Whale Exhibits&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924092743/http://www.mnh.si.edu/onehundredyears/profiles/Whales_SI.html |date=2011-09-24 }}, National Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fair also featured the original &quot;Floatopia&quot;. Visitors floated on rafts of all sorts in the tiny Forest Park Lake. Many Floatopias have occurred since, including the infamous San Diego Floatopia of '83 and the Santa Barbara Floatopia that has been happening for years.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

One exhibit of note was [[Beautiful Jim Key]], the &quot;educated&quot; Arabian-Hambletonian cross horse in his Silver Horseshoe Pavilion.  He was owned by Dr. William Key, an African-American/Native American former slave, who became a respected self-taught veterinarian, and promoted by Albert R. Rogers, who had Jim and Dr. Key on tour for years around the US, helping to establish a humane movement that encouraged people to think of animals as having feelings and thoughts, and not just &quot;brutes.&quot;  Jim and Dr. Key became national celebrities along the way.  Rogers invented highly successful marketing strategies still in use today.  Jim Key could add, subtract, use a cash register, spell with blocks, tell time and give opinions on the politics of the day by shaking his head yes or no.  Jim thoroughly enjoyed his &quot;act&quot;—he performed more than just tricks and appeared to clearly understand what was going on.  Dr. Key's motto was that Jim &quot;was taught by kindness&quot; instead of the whip, which he was indeed.&lt;ref&gt;Rivas, Mim Eichler, &quot;Beautiful Jim Key: The Lost History of a Horse and a Man Who Changed the World,&quot; 1st ed, HarperCollins, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1904 Summer Olympics ==
{{Main|1904 Summer Olympics}}
The Fair hosted the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympic Games]], the first Olympics held in the United States. The games had originally been awarded to Chicago, but when St. Louis threatened to hold a rival international competition,&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Barney, &quot;Born from Dilemma: America Awakens to the Modern Olympic Games, 1901–1903,&quot; ''Olympika'' 1 (1992): 92–135&lt;/ref&gt; the games were relocated. Nonetheless, the sporting events, spread out over several months, were overshadowed by the Fair. With travel expenses high, many European athletes did not attend, nor did the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]].

== Bullfight riot ==
{{Main|St. Louis bullfight riot}}
On June 5, 1904, a bullfight scheduled for an arena just north of the fairgrounds, in conjunction with the fair, turned violent when Missouri governor [[Alexander Monroe Dockery]] ordered police to halt the fight in light of Missouri's anti-bullfighting laws. Disgruntled spectators demanded refunds, and when they were turned away, they began throwing stones through the windows of the arena office. While police protected the office, they did not have sufficient numbers to protect the arena, which was burned to the ground by the mob. The exposition fire department responded to the fire, but disruption to the fair was minimal, as the riot took place on a Sunday, when the fair was closed.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

== Anglo-Boer War Concession ==
[[File:1904 worlds fair boer war program.jpg|thumb|right|Anglo-Boer War program sold at the exhibition]]
[[Frank E. Fillis]] produced what was supposedly &quot;the greatest and most realistic military spectacle known in the history of the world&quot;.{{cn|date = September 2020}} Different portions of the concession featured a British Army encampment, several South African native villages (including [[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[San people|San]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Ndebele]]) and a {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} arena in which soldiers paraded, sporting events and horse races were held and major battles from the [[Second Boer War]] were re-enacted twice a day. Battle recreations took 2–3 hours and included several Generals and 600 veteran soldiers from both sides of the war. At the conclusion of the show, the [[Boer]] General [[Christiaan de Wet]] would escape on horseback by leaping from a height of {{convert|35|ft|m}} into a pool of water.

Admission ranged from 25 cents for bleacher seats to one dollar for box seats, and admission to the villages was another 25 cents. The concession cost $48,000 to construct, grossed over $630,000, and netted about $113,000 to the fair—the highest-grossing military concession of the fair.

== Notable attenders ==

The Louisiana World fair was opened by [[US president]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], by telegraph, but he did not attend personally until after the federal election in November 1904, as he stated he did not wish to use the fair for political purposes. Attenders included [[John Philip Sousa]], a musician, composer and conductor whose band performed on opening day and several times during the fair. [[Thomas Edison]] is claimed to have attended.

[[Ragtime]] music was popularly featured at the Fair. [[Scott Joplin]] wrote &quot;The Cascades&quot; specifically for the fair, inspired by the waterfalls at the Grand Basin, and presumably attended the fair.

[[Helen Keller]], who was 24 and graduated from [[Radcliffe College]], gave a lecture in the main auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conrad Hilton]]. 1957. Be My Guest: Prentice Hall Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.T. Stinson]], a well-regarded fruit specialist, introduced the phrase, &quot;An apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot; (at a lecture during the exhibition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George W.

The French organist [[Alexandre Guilmant]] played a series of 40 recitals, from memory, on the great organ in Festival Hall, then the largest [[pipe organ]] in the world.

[[Geronimo]], the former [[Tribal chief|war chief]] of the [[Apache]], was &quot;on display&quot; in a teepee in the Ethnology Exhibit.

[[Henri Poincaré]] gave a keynote address on [[mathematical physics]], including an outline for what would eventually become known as [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/miller-01einstein.html|title=Einstein, Picasso - Space, Time, and the Beauty That Causes Havoc By ARTHUR I.

[[Jelly Roll Morton]] did not visit, stating in his later [[Library of Congress]] interview and recordings that he expected jazz pianist [[Tony Jackson (jazz musician)|Tony Jackson]] would attend and win a jazz piano competition at the Exposition. Morton said he was &quot;quite disgusted&quot; to later learn that Jackson had not attended either, and that the competition had been won instead by [[Alfred Wilson (jazz pianist)|Alfred Wilson]]; Morton considered himself a better pianist than Wilson.

The poet [[T. S. Eliot]], who was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, visited the [[Igorot]] Village held in the Philippine Exposition section of the St. Louis World's Fair. Several months after the closing of the World's Fair, he published a short story entitled &quot;The Man Who Was King&quot; in the school magazine of Smith Academy, St. Louis, Missouri, that he was attending. Inspired by the ganza dance which the Igorot people presented regularly in the Village and their reaction to &quot;civilization,&quot; the poet explored the interaction of a white man with the island culture. All this predates the poet's delving into the anthropological studies during his Harvard graduate years.&lt;ref&gt;Narita, Tatsushi, &quot;Fiction and Fact in T. S. Eliot's 'The Man Who Was King'&quot;, ''Notes and Queries'', vol. 237, no. 2, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narita, Tatsushi, ''T. S.

In 1491, Warbeck landed in [[Ireland]] in the hope of gaining support for his claim as [[Lambert Simnel]] had four years previously. His cause was promoted by [[John Atwater]], a former [[Mayor of Cork]] and ardent Yorkist, who may have been instrumental in helping him assume the identity of Richard. However, little support for an active rebellion was found and Warbeck was forced to return to mainland Europe. There his fortunes improved. He was first received by [[Charles VIII of France]], but in 1492 was expelled under the terms of the [[Treaty of Etaples]], by which Charles had agreed not to shelter rebels against Henry VII. Charles VIII agreed to withdraw all backing from Warbeck after an English expedition had [[Siege of Boulogne (1492)|laid siege to Boulogne]]. He was publicly recognized as Richard of Shrewsbury by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]], widow of [[Charles the Bold]], sister of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and thus the aunt of the Princes in the Tower. Whether Margaret – who left England to marry before either of her nephews were born – truly believed that the pretender was her nephew Richard, or whether she considered him a fraud but supported him anyway, is unknown, but she tutored him in the ways of the Yorkist court.

Henry complained to [[Philip I of Castile|Philip of Habsburg]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], about the harbouring of the pretender, and, since he was ignored, imposed a trade embargo on Burgundy, cutting off important Burgundian trade connections with England. The pretender was also welcomed by various other monarchs and was known in international diplomacy as the [[Duke of York]]. At the invitation of Duke Philip's father, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Maximilian I]], in 1493, he attended the funeral of the [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]] and was recognised as King Richard IV of England.&lt;ref&gt;Wroe, Ann, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support in England (The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy)==

Pro-Yorkist sympathy in England involved important figures making it known that they were prepared to back Warbeck's claims. These included Lord Fitzwater, [[Simon de Montford|Sir Simon Montfort]], [[Thomas Thwaites (civil servant)|Sir Thomas Thwaites]] (ex-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] (the [[Lord Chamberlain]]) and Sir Robert Clifford. Clifford went over to mainland Europe and wrote back to his friends to confirm Warbeck's real identity as Prince Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsandladies.org/perkin-warbeck.htm|title= Perkin Warbeck|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Henry ordered the group of supporters to be rounded up and put on trial. All were duly arrested, together with William D'Aubeney, Thomas Cressener, Thomas Astwode, Robert Ratcliff and others. Lord Fitzwater was sent as a prisoner to Calais and later beheaded for trying to bribe his gaolers.

In show trials in January 1495 all the conspirators were initially condemned to death, although six, including Thwaites, were then pardoned and their sentences commuted to imprisonment and fines. Within days Sir Simon Montfort, Robert Ratcliff and William D'Aubeney were beheaded at [[Tower Hill]] and Cressener and Astwode pardoned at the block. Later the same month Sir William Stanley was also beheaded. Other members of the group were imprisoned and fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Perkin Warbeck Conspiracy| first=Ian|last=Arthurson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Robert Clifford was pardoned and rewarded for revealing the names of the conspirators.

==First landing in England and support in Scotland (1495–1496)==

On 3 July 1495, funded by Margaret of Burgundy, Warbeck landed at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] in [[Kent]], hoping for a show of popular support. They were confronted by locals loyal to Henry VII in the ensuing [[Battle of Deal]]. Warbeck's small army was routed and 150 of the pretender's troops were killed without Warbeck even disembarking. He was forced to retreat almost immediately, this time to Ireland. There he found support from [[Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond]], and laid siege to [[Waterford]], but, meeting resistance, he fled to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Henry pardoned Warbeck's Irish supporters, remarking drily that  &quot;I suppose they will crown an ape next&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shea, Joe  &quot;If not for collins, why is it called the rebel county?&quot;  ''Irish Independent''  4 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Warbeck was well received by [[James IV of Scotland]], who realised that his presence gave him international leverage. As [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain were negotiating an alliance with Henry VII, James IV knew that Spain would help him in his struggles with England in order to prevent the situation escalating into war with France.&lt;ref name=macdougall&gt;Macdougall, Norman p. 123-124, 136, 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ambassadors arrived in Edinburgh, and later [[Pedro de Ayala]] was established as a resident ambassador during the crisis. Warbeck married [[Lady Catherine Gordon]], a daughter of [[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]]. The marriage was celebrated in Edinburgh with a tournament. James gave Warbeck clothes for the wedding and armour covered with purple silk.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 257, 262–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Katie Stevenson (historian)|Katie Stevenson]] suggests the clothing bought for the tournament shows Warbeck fought in a team with the king and four knights.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Katie, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of a love letter in Latin obtained by Pedro de Ayala is thought to be Warbeck's proposal to Lady Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=93373 ''Calendar State Papers Spain'', vol. 1 (London, 1862), no. 119 &amp; fn.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, James' biographer [[Norman Macdougall]] comments that it is clear that nobody, with the possible exception of Margaret of Burgundy, took seriously his claim to be the prince; his marriage to a junior Scots noblewoman was scarcely what might be expected for a potential king of England.&lt;ref name=macdougall /&gt;

In September 1496, James IV prepared to invade England with Warbeck. A red, gold and silver banner was made for Warbeck as the Duke of York; James's armour was gilded and painted; and the royal artillery was prepared.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 292–296.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell|John Ramsay of Balmain]] (who called himself Lord Bothwell) described the events for Henry VII. He saw Roderic de Lalanne, a Flemish knight, arrive with two little ships and 60 German soldiers and meet James IV and talk to Warbeck. In Edinburgh Castle Ramsay saw two great French guns called 'curtalds,' 10 [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]] or little serpentines, and 30 iron breech loading 'cart guns' with 16 close-carts or wagons for the munitions. He estimated the invasion force would last only four to five days in England before it ran out of provisions. He suggested, from the safety of [[Berwick upon Tweed]], that the Scots could be vanquished by a modest English force attacking from north and south in a [[pincer movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton, John, p. 438-441&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish host assembled near Edinburgh and James IV and Warbeck offered prayers at [[Holyrood Abbey]] on 14 September, and on the next day at St Triduana's Chapel and Our Lady Kirk of [[Restalrig]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 299–300, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September 1496 the Scottish army was at Ellem and on 21 September they crossed the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] at [[Coldstream]]. Miners set to work to demolish [[Heaton Castle]] on 24 September, but the army quickly retreated when resources were expended,&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped-for support for Perkin Warbeck in [[Northumberland]] failed to materialise. According to an English record, the Scots penetrated four miles into England with royal banner displayed, and destroyed three or four little towers (or [[Bastle house]]s). They left on 25 September 1496 when an English army commanded by [[Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland|Lord Neville]] approached from Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357–1509, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 418–9 no. 35 (there dated as if '1497'): David Dunlop (1991), 108–9 &amp; fn., quotes another version, and cites four more, noting mistaken date in Bain (1888).&lt;/ref&gt; When news of this invasion reached [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]], on 21 October 1496, he wrote to his ambassador in Spain, to request the Spanish monarchs make peace between England and Scotland. The peace mission was entrusted to the Spanish ambassador in Scotland, [[Pedro de Ayala]], who had been Perkin's companion in Northumberland.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar State Papers Milan&quot; (London, 1912), no. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, wishing to be rid of Warbeck, James IV provided a ship called the ''Cuckoo'' and a hired crew under a Breton captain, [[Guy Foulcart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Kerr Hannay]], ''Letters of James IV'' (SHS: Edinburgh, 1953), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Horses were hired for 30 of Perkin's companions to ride to the ship at [[Ayr]] on 5 July 1497. Pedro de Ayala accompanied Perkin to Ayr. Perkin pawned a horse for cash in Ayr and sailed to Waterford in shame.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dickson, ''Accounts of the Treasurer'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 342-5.&lt;/ref&gt; James IV made peace with England by signing the [[Treaty of Ayton]] at [[Ayton Parish Church|St Dionysius's Church]] in [[Ayton, Scottish Borders|Ayton]] in [[Berwickshire]]. Once again Perkin attempted to lay siege to Waterford, but this time his effort lasted only eleven days before he was forced to flee Ireland, chased by four English ships. According to some sources, by this time he was left with only 120 men on two ships.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Second landing in England==
{{Main|Second Cornish Uprising of 1497}}
[[File:P102-Beaulieu Abby, where Perkin Warbeck took Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|[[Beaulieu Abbey]] in Hampshire, where Warbeck took sanctuary]]

On 7 September 1497, Warbeck landed at [[Whitesand Bay (Cornwall)|Whitesand Bay]], two miles north of [[Land's End]], in [[Cornwall]] hoping to capitalise on the [[Cornish people]]'s resentment in the aftermath of [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|their uprising]] only three months earlier. Warbeck proclaimed that he could put a stop to extortionate taxes levied to help fight a war against Scotland and was warmly welcomed. He was declared &quot;Richard IV&quot; on [[Bodmin Moor]] and his Cornish army some 6000 strong entered [[Exeter]] before advancing on [[Taunton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Cornish History 1066–1700 AD|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749|website=www.cornwall.gov.uk|accessdate=10 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619090607/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749|archivedate=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payton2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Payton|first=Philip|title=Cornwall: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCvxdhNLHIC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2004|publisher=Cornwall Editions Limited|isbn=978-1-904880-05-9|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] sent his chief general, [[Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney]], to attack the Cornish and when Warbeck heard that the King's scouts were at [[Glastonbury]] he panicked and deserted his army.

Warbeck was captured at [[Beaulieu Abbey]] in [[Hampshire]] where he surrendered. Henry VII reached [[Taunton]] on 4 October 1497, where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined. Warbeck was imprisoned, first at Taunton, then at the [[Tower of London]], where he was &quot;paraded through the streets on horseback amid much hooting and derision of the citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkin Warbeck|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/perkin.html|website=www.channel4com|accessdate=10 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514021704/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/perkin.html|archivedate=14 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and death==

Warbeck was initially treated well by Henry. As soon as he confessed to being an impostor, he was released from the Tower of London, and was given accommodation at Henry's court. He was even allowed to be present at royal banquets. He was, however, kept under guard and was not allowed to sleep with his wife, who was living under the protection of the queen.

After eight months at court, Warbeck tried to escape. He was quickly recaptured. He was then held in the Tower, initially in solitary confinement, and later alongside [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]]; the two tried to escape in 1499. Captured once again, Warbeck was led from the Tower to [[Tyburn, London]] on 23 November 1499, where he read out a confession and was [[Hanging|hanged]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ali&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goble|first1=Rachel|title=The Execution of Perkin Warbeck|journal=History Today|date=11 November 1999|issue=11|url=http://www.historytoday.com/rachel-goble/execution-perkin-warbeck|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warbeck's Irish ally John Atwater was also executed at Tyburn on the same day. The Earl of Warwick was beheaded on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 November 1499.

Warbeck was buried in [[Austin Friars, London]].&lt;ref&gt;''Great Chronicle of London'', [[Guildhall Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; The presumed site of his unmarked grave still exists as the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars]].

His story was featured in [[Francis Bacon]]'s 1622 work ''[[History of the Reign of King Henry VII]]''.

==Appearance==

Perkin reportedly resembled Edward IV in appearance, which has led to speculation that he might have been Edward's illegitimate son, or at least had some genuine connection with the York family. [[Francis Bacon]] believed he was one of Edward's many illegitimate children.&lt;ref name = &quot;ali&quot; /&gt; It has also been suggested that he was a son of one of Edward's siblings, either [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] or [[Margaret of York]], Warbeck's first major sponsor.&lt;ref name = &quot;ali&quot; /&gt;

Some authors, for example [[Horace Walpole]], have even gone as far as to claim that Warbeck actually ''was'' Richard, Duke of York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Sabor|editor1-first=Peter|title=Horace Walpole: The Critical Heritage|date=1768|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415134361|page=124|chapter=Memoires Litteraires}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is little academic support for this view.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Warbeck in popular culture==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2016}}

Warbeck's story subsequently attracted writers, most notably the dramatist [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], who dramatized the story in his play ''[[Perkin Warbeck (play)|Perkin Warbeck]]'', first performed in the 1630s.
* {{lang|de|[[Friedrich Schiller]]}} wrote a plan and a few scenes for a play about Warbeck; he never finished the play because he gave priority to other works, such as ''Maria Stuart'' and {{lang|de|Wilhelm Tell}}.&lt;ref&gt;Benno von Wiese: ''Friedrich Schiller'' (in German) Stuttgart: J. B. Metzlersche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1959, p. 781-786.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuehnle-online.de/literatur/schiller/werke/nachlass/warbeck/2-0.htm |title=Friedrich Schiller – Nachlass – II.

* [[Mary Shelley]], best known as the author of ''[[Frankenstein]]'', wrote a romance on the subject of Warbeck, ''[[The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck]]'', published in London in 1830.
* [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] wrote a poem about Perkin Warbeck in 1893 or 1894. It is included in the ''Collected Poems of Lord Alfred Douglas'' published in 1928.
* In [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s mystery novel ''[[Have His Carcase]]'', [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] discovers that the murderers lured the victim to his death by playing on his secret belief that he was the hereditary Tsar of Russia, based on his great-great-grandmother's purported [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]; when [[Harriet Vane]] points out that even if this were true, the man would not be the next in line to the throne, Peter remarks that [[genealogy]] has a way of making people believe what they want to believe, saying he knows a &quot;draper's assistant&quot; in [[Leeds]] who earnestly believes he will be crowned King of England as soon as he can find the record of his ancestor's marriage to Perkin Warbeck; the fact that Warbeck's claim to the throne was ultimately invalidated, and that the Tudor dynasty he laid claim to has since been replaced by others, doesn't faze him in the least.
* The historical novel ''The Tudor Rose'' by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]] deals at length with the Warbeck plot, and implies that Warback actually was [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]].
* Warbeck is the central character in [[Philip Lindsay]]'s historical novel ''They Have Their Dreams''.
* In 2005 [[Channel 4]] and RDF Media produced a drama entitled ''Princes in the Tower'' about the interrogation of Warbeck, starring [[Mark Umbers]]. Warbeck almost convinces Henry VII that he really is Richard, Duke of York. Warbeck &quot;remembers&quot; that Henry's mother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] poisoned his brother Edward V, after which Richard III spirited him away to safety. Warbeck succeeds in alienating King Henry from his mother and wife, who now believes Warbeck to be her lost brother. Margaret then shows Warbeck two young men in chains, who she presents as the real princes, locked up for years in isolation and now completely insane. She says Henry knows nothing about them. She forces Warbeck to confess he is an imposter to save the life of his son by [[Lady Catherine Gordon]]. Warbeck confesses and is hanged. In the final scene Margaret is seen overseeing the burial of a piece of regal clothing with two skeletons, while, in voice-over, [[Thomas More]], whose secret account of the events is supposed to be the drama's source, describes how lucky he has been under Henry VIII.
* In the 1972 [[BBC]] television series ''[[The Shadow of the Tower]]'', Warbeck was portrayed by British actor [[Richard Warwick]].
* The [[American Shakespeare Center]] (ASC) in [[Staunton, Virginia]], produced a comedy entitled ''The Brats of Clarence'', written specifically for the ASC 'Blackfriars' stage by Paul Menzer. The play tracks the progress of Perkin Warbeck from the Scottish court towards London to claim his birthright as heir to the throne.
* Warbeck and his wife are characters in the novel ''The Crimson Crown'' by Edith Layton (1990). The main character is Lucas Lovat, a spy in the Court of Henry VII, and a subplot of the novel is his indecision as to whether Warbeck is, or is not, Prince Richard.
* English comedians [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]] both make references to Warbeck, and fellow pretender [[Lambert Simnel]] in much of their work, both as [[Lee and Herring]] and individually. Simnel and Warbeck's names have appeared sporadically throughout their material over the years.
* Warbeck's story is retold through the eyes of Grace Plantagenet in ''The King's Grace'', by Anne Easter Smith (2009).  Grace, an illegitimate daughter of Edward IV, attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the man who claims to be her half-brother Richard. Rosemary Hawley Jarman, in her novel &quot;We Speak No Treason&quot;, also fictionalised unconfirmed speculation that Warbeck could have been another of Edward's illegitimate sons.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Hawley Jarman, We Speak No Treason, Book 1, Part Two&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Anne Easter, The King's Grace&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Philippa Gregory]]'s 2009 novel ''[[The White Queen (novel)|The White Queen]]'', [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|the young Duke of York]] is sent into hiding by his mother, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], while a changeling is sent to the Tower. In the fifth novel of Gregory's ''The Cousins' War'' series, ''[[The White Princess]]'', a mysterious pretender appears, claiming to be Richard. King Henry Tudor invents an elaborate false history to justify denial of the pretender's claims, giving him the name Perkin Warbeck (among others). Although the novel never answers the question, Gregory states in the epilogue that she believes Warbeck's claim was genuine.
* A miniseries ''[[The White Princess (miniseries)|The White Princess]]'' adapted from Gregory's novel was first aired on [[Starz]] in 2017 where Perkin Warbeck was played by Irish actor [[Patrick Gibson (actor)|Patrick Gibson]]. Unlike Gregory's original work, the series portrays Warbeck as the genuine Duke of York, who has escaped England and been raised by a Flemish boat maker.
* A [[public house]] in [[Taunton]] and a cafe and shop in [[Falkland, Fife]] are named after Warbeck.
* In the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Warbeck's name can be seen in the opening memory on a list of British Templars.
* A latter section of Terence Morgan's novel ''The Master of Bruges'', expands on the theory that Prince Richard escaped to [[Flanders]], grew up in [[Tournai]] and returned to England as Perkin Warbeck.

'''Monmouth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|m|ə|θ}} {{Respell|MON|məth}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|n|-}} {{Respell|MUN|-}}; {{lang-cy|Trefynwy}} meaning &quot;town on the Monnow&quot;) is both the historic [[county town]] of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] in [[Wales]] and a [[community (Wales)|community]]. Situated where the [[River Monnow]] joins the [[River Wye]], {{convert|2|mi}} from the [[Wales–England border]]. Monmouth is {{convert|30|mi}} northeast of [[Cardiff]], and {{convert|113|mi}} west of London. It is within the [[Monmouthshire]] local authority, and the [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Monmouth]]. The population in the 2011 census was 10,508, rising from 8,877 in 2001.

The town was the site of a small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] fort, [[Blestium]], and became established after the [[Normans]] built a [[Monmouth Castle|castle]] {{circa|1067}}. The [[mediaeval|medieval]] [[Monnow Bridge|stone gated bridge]] is the only one of its type remaining in Britain.  The castle later came into the possession of the [[House of Lancaster]], and was the birthplace of King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1386. In 1536, it became the county town of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]].

A [[market town]] and a focus of educational and cultural activities for the surrounding rural area, Monmouth has become a [[tourism]] centre at the heart of the [[Wye Valley]].

==Etymology==
The name Monmouth is an [[English language|English]] contraction of 'Monnow-mouth'.  The Welsh name for the river, ''Mynwy'', which may originally have meant &quot;fast-flowing&quot;, was [[anglicisation|anglicised]] as [[River Monnow|Monnow]].  The town was originally known in Welsh as ''Abermynwy'' (&quot;mouth of the Monnow&quot;), replaced by ''Trefynwy'' (&quot;Monnow town&quot; – the initial ''m'' of ''Mynwy'' [[Lenition|mutating]] in Welsh to ''f'' pronounced /v/) by the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-Names of Wales'', 2000, [[University of Wales]] Press, {{ISBN|0-7083-1458-9}}, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Excavations undertaken by the [[Monmouth Archaeological Society]] on sites along Monnow Street have uncovered details of the early history of the town. The [[Council for British Archaeology]] has designated Monmouth as one of the top ten towns in Britain for archaeology.&lt;ref name=kissack&gt;[[Keith Kissack]], ''Monmouth and its Buildings'', Logaston Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-904396-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric===
Evidence of a [[Bronze Age]] [[boat building]] community, including three {{convert|100|ft}} long channels adjoining the site of a now-vanished lake, was discovered in September 2013, during archaeological investigations by the [[Monmouth Archaeological Society]] of the [[Parc Glyndwr]] housing development site, immediately north-west of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24271564|title=Bronze Age 'boat building' discovery in Monmouth|date=25 September 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavations later revealed the remains of a [[Neolithic]] [[crannog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SWEP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Welsh-fortress-older-Pyramids-unearthed-new/story-27455536-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813143020/http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Welsh-fortress-older-Pyramids-unearthed-new/story-27455536-detail/story.html |archive-date=13 August 2015 |title=Welsh fortress older than the Pyramids is unearthed at new housing estate |date=21 July 2015 |newspaper=[[South Wales Evening Post]] |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dwelling was constructed on stilts on a man-made island away from the lake shore in water up to {{convert|10|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWEP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Fortress-older-pyramids-uncovered/story-27466572-detail/story.html |title=Fortress older than the pyramids is uncovered in Monmouth |date=23 July 2015 |publisher=[[Western Daily Press]] |accessdate=26 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725001511/http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Fortress-older-pyramids-uncovered/story-27466572-detail/story.html |archive-date=25 July 2015 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oak timbers had been &quot;skillfully&quot; cut with stone or flint axes to form stilts, of posts and poles, which &quot;probably&quot; rested on three parallel fully-grown tree 'sleeper beams', up to {{convert|3|ft|3|in|0}} wide, laid horizontally on the lakebed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWEP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WDP&quot;/&gt; Timbers from the structure were [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 4867&amp;nbsp;[[Before Present|years before present (BP)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Martin |last=Shipton |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/ancient-lakeside-settlement-older-pyramids-9702162 |title=Ancient lakeside settlement older than the PYRAMIDS uncovered on new housing estate |date=21 July 2015 |publisher=[[Media Wales]] |work=walesonline |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman times===
The first recorded settlement at Monmouth was the small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] fort of ''[[Blestium]]'', one of a network of military bases established on the frontiers of the Roman occupation.  This was connected [[Roman road|by road]] to the larger Roman towns at ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]) and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]]).  Archaeologists have found [[Ancient Roman pottery|Roman pottery]] and [[Roman currency|coins]] within the modern town centre.  During the later Roman period, between the 2nd and late 4th centuries, it appears to have been a centre for [[iron working]], using the local [[iron ore]]s and [[charcoal]] also worked at nearby ''[[Gobannium]]'' ([[Abergavenny]]) and ''[[Ariconium]]'' (near [[Ross-on-Wye]]).&lt;ref name=ggatlandscape/&gt;&lt;ref name=newman&gt;[[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]], ''The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-071053-1}}, pp.393–412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;[http://www.monmouth-south.co.uk/South_Monmouth_Weather_Station/Brief_History.html A Brief History of the Town of Monmouth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305041740/http://www.monmouth-south.co.uk/South_Monmouth_Weather_Station/Brief_History.html |date=5 March 2012 }}.

===The Middle Ages===

After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the area was at the southern edge of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] kingdom of [[Ergyng]].  The only evidence of continuing settlement at Monmouth is a record of a 7th-century church, at an unknown location within the town, dedicated to the Welsh [[saint]] [[Cadoc]].  In 1056, the area was devastated by the Welsh prince [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], on his way with an army of Welsh, [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] and [[Danes]] to defeat [[Ralph the Timid|Ralph]], [[Earl of Hereford]], and sack the Saxon ''[[burh]]'' at [[Hereford]], {{convert|18|mi}} to the north.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt;

Following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the Earldom of Hereford was given to [[William FitzOsbern]] of [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]], [[Normandy]], one of [[William the Conqueror|King William]]'s closest allies, who was responsible for defending the area against the Welsh. [[Monmouth Castle|A new castle]] was built at Monmouth, holding commanding views over the surrounding area from a sound defensive site and exerting control over both river crossings and the area's important resources of farmland, timber and minerals.&lt;ref name=ggatlandscape/&gt; Initially it would have been a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]], later rebuilt in stone, and refortified and developed over time.  A town grew up around it, and a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] was established around 1075 by [[Withenoc]], a [[Breton people|Breton]] who became lord of Monmouth after [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger]], the son of William fitzOsbern, was disgraced.&lt;ref name=ggatlandscape/&gt; The priory may have once been the residence of the [[monk]] [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], who was born around 1100 and is best known for writing the chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;).

The town was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]], and expanded thereafter. There was early [[burgage]] development along Monnow Street, and the [[suburb]] of [[Overmonnow]], west of the river and protected by a defensive moat called the [[Clawdd-du]] or Black ditch, began to develop by the 12th century.&lt;ref name=ggatlandscape&gt;[http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/wye_valley/english/wyevalley_features.htm Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Landscape Characterisation: Lower Wye Valley].  Accessed 11 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Charters from the period refer to the town's trade in [[iron]], and to [[forge]]s making use of local [[iron ore|ore]] and [[charcoal]].  The [[cinder]]s produced by the forges formed heaps, and were used in building foundations; the name of Cinderhill Street in Overmonnow dates from this period.&lt;ref name=kissackmedieval&gt;{{cite book|last=Kissack|first=Keith|title=Mediaeval Monmouth| publisher = The Monmouth Historical and Educational Trust|year= 1974| page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of turmoil between the supporters of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and the barons who sought to curtail his power, the town was the scene of a major [[Battle of Monmouth (1233)|battle in 1233]], in which the king's forces were routed by the troops of [[Richard Marshal]], [[Earl of Pembroke]].  Later, the castle was extended by Henry's son [[Edmund Crouchback]], after he became [[Earl of Lancaster]] in 1267.&lt;ref name=ggatlandscape/&gt;  In about 1300, town walls were built, and the [[Monnow Bridge|bridge over the Monnow]] was [[fortification|fortified]].  The bridge, now [[pedestrianisation|pedestrianised]], remains in place today, the only such fortified bridge in Britain and reputedly one of only three similar crossings in Europe.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt;&lt;ref name=tchistory&gt;[http://www.monmouth.gov.uk/pages/monmouth.asp Monmouth Town Council: History of the town] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424161512/http://www.monmouth.gov.uk/pages/monmouth.asp |date=24 April 2012 }}.

King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] was briefly imprisoned at Monmouth Castle in 1326 after being overthrown by his wife [[Isabella of France|Isabella]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer of Wigmore|Roger Mortimer]], the Earl of March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Saaler 1997, p. 134&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Saaler | first=Mary | year=1997 | title=Edward II: 1307–1327 | url=https://archive.org/details/edwardii1307132700mary | url-access=registration | publisher=Rubicon Press | location=Norwich | page=[https://archive.org/details/edwardii1307132700mary/page/134 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid 14th century, the castle and town came into the possession of the [[House of Lancaster]] through the marriage of [[John of Gaunt]] to [[Blanche of Lancaster]].  John of Gaunt strengthened the castle, adding the Great Hall, and the castle became a favourite residence of the House of Lancaster. In 1387, John of Gaunt's grandson was born to [[Mary de Bohun]], in the Queen's Chamber within the gatehouse of Monmouth Castle, while his father [[Henry Bolingbroke]] was [[hunting]] in the area.  The boy was known as Henry of Monmouth before his coronation as [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]; supported by [[longbowmen]] from the area,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34618197 Neil Prior, &quot;Was the Battle of Agincourt really a victory for Wales?&quot;, ''BBC'', 25 October 2015]. Retrieved 13 April 2020&lt;/ref&gt; he won the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415.  Monmouth's links with Henry are commemorated in the naming of the main town square, Agincourt Square, and in the statue of Henry on the front of the [[Shire Hall, Monmouth|Shire Hall]].

From the 14th century onwards, the town became noted for the production of [[wool]]len [[Monmouth cap]]s.&lt;ref name=tchistory/&gt; However, as a border town, its prosperity suffered after nearby areas, including [[Battle of Pwll Melyn|Usk]] and [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]], were devastated through [[Glyndŵr Rising|attacks]] by supporters of [[Owain Glyndŵr]] around 1405, though Monmouth itself did not come under attack.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt;

In 1536, [[Henry VIII]] imposed the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]], abolishing the powers of the [[Marcher Lords]] and integrating the administration of [[England and Wales]].  A new [[shire]] was created covering the area west of [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Herefordshire]], and Monmouth became its county town.  The town gained representation in the [[English Parliament]] at the same time, and its priory was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]].  In 1605, [[James I of England|James I]] granted Monmouth a [[town charter]] by [[letters patent]]. The granting of the charter included the charge that the town &quot;at all perpetual future times ... be and remain a town and borough of Peace and Quiet, to the example and terror of the wicked and reward of the good&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tchistory&quot; /&gt;  The layout of the town as depicted in Speed's map of 1610 would be easily recognisable to present day inhabitants, with the layout of the main axis clearly visible from the castle via the main street, [[Monnow Street]], to the bridge. Monnow Street is a typical market street, in being wide in the middle (for those selling) and narrow at each end, to help prevent livestock escaping.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt;

The [[house system]] was first introduced by Terence Iles during his headship in the 1960s. But it was later suspended and not until 1991 was it re-introduced by [[Yeung Po-kwan]]. The five houses, each with its own signature colour and mascot, commemorate five very important persons in the history of the school, namely Hoh Fuk Tong, Leung Faat, Milne, Morrison and Noble. The Houses, abbreviations, representative colours and mascots are as shown in the inset on the right.

Upon entering the Ying Wa College, new students are divided into five houses. The five houses compete every year in culture, music and athletics with a prize. The house with the highest overall score is awarded a trophy. Through this system, the competition encourages student excitement, achievement, school mate camaraderie and greater enthusiasm and school spirit. In the past, student was divided into houses according to their classes during secondary 1, i.e. students of the same class belonged to the same house. This policy has changed in recent years, where now there are members of the five houses in one class in secondary 1.

==School song, school hymn, school cry==
===School song===
&quot;Home of Our Youth&quot;, written by Rupert Baldwin in 1938 is the school song; it is also a figuration of the College, a symbol of the brotherhood of the students. &lt;!-- '''Home of Our Youth'''
 ''by Rupert Baldwin (1938)''
likely to be still subject to copyright --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Home of our youth
To thee we bring the homage of lives at the spring
Training thy sons for the game of life
Sending them forth to the age-long strive
Ready thy name ever-bright to uphold
Ready ’gainst evil, to fight and be bold
May those who left thee in years that are past
Guard well thy honour, to truth holding fast
Home of our youth,&lt;br /&gt;To thee will we sing
Long may thy name on our lips proudly ring&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===School Hymn===
The school hymn, &quot;We build our School on Thee, O Lord&quot; by Sebastian W. Meyer, is not used as frequently used as the school song; it is typically used in the Annual Speech Day amongst other ceremonious occasions. It is also used in some other schools in Hong Kong, including [[Sheng Kung Hui Lam Woo Memorial Secondary School]], [[Sheng Kung Hui Tang Shiu Kin Secondary School]], [[St. Paul's College, Hong Kong|St. Paul's College]] and [[St Stephen's Girls' College]].&lt;!-- Sebastian W. Meyer died in 1946, thus &quot;We build our School on Thee, O Lord&quot; is likely still to be subject to copyright --&gt;

===School Cry===
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;TWO, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT, WHAT DO WE APPRECIATE? YING WA! YING WA! WA! WA! WA!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ying Wa Cry is a mantra devised by former headmaster Mr Terence Iles for cheering purpose in inter-school sports events. Its use is not limited today, as students would chant spontaneously in various school events, like the swimming gala, the athletic meet and the school anniversary day.

There is a special tradition involving the Ying Wa Cry. Each time after the school song is sung (excluding formal events, e.g. events that take place in the Noble Hall), students would chant the cry continuously under the lead of one or more students, and the ceremony would end in a rumble of claps.

To lead the cry, one has to say (in Cantonese) &quot;''Ying Wa Boys: one, two, three...''&quot; (''英華仔：一、二、三⋯⋯''), and then the mass would follow &quot;TWO, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT, WHAT DO WE APPRECIATE? YING WA! YING WA! WA! WA! WA!&quot;

==Extracurricular activities==

===Student Council===
Established in the 1960s, the College Student Council is responsible for organising various kinds of in-school and inter-school activities. The Council consists of eight cabinet members, sub-committee members and representatives of different student bodies, including the Prefects' Board, the Houses, the Music Union, the Sports Section, the school newspaper editorial board, as well as other clubs and societies.

====The Cabinet====
The Cabinet of the Council consists of eight members:
* President;
* Internal Vice-President;
* External Vice-President;
* Treasurer;
* Secretary for Culture;
* Secretary for Welfare;
* Secretary for Recreation;
* Secretary for Publicity;
The election of the Council is usually held in October, in which members of the Cabinet are elected by the whole school, including teachers and students. If the Cabinet is not formed due to whatever reason, the previous Cabinet (i.e. that from last year) will continue their service until the end of the first term. This, however, has never happened. The Inauguration of the members of the Student Council, as well as the Clubs and Societies, will be held after the election. They are required to read out the Oath of Office after the Headmaster.

Once the Cabinet is formed, the cabinet members are responsible for the function of the Council. They are assisted by a group of sub-committee members in organising different events, such as the Annual Ball, Ying Wa Premier League (football) matches, YWBA (basketball) matches, celebrating events on the School Anniversary Day, etc.

====The Nineteen Members' Board====
The Nineteen Members' Board, known as the 'Big Nineteen' (or 十九大 in Chinese), consists of the nine members of the Cabinet as well as ten representatives of the student groups:
* Head Prefect &amp; Deputy Head prefect -representing the Prefects' Board
* House captains (5 in total) – representing the five Houses
* Music Captain – representing the Music Union
* Sports Captain – representing the Sports Section
* Chief Editor of ''Torch'' (the school newspaper) – representing the editorial board
The Board is responsible for passing the proposal and the budget of the Cabinet.

{{Redirect|Li(x)|the polylogarithm denoted by Li&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')|Polylogarithm}}
{{Short description|Special function defined by an integral}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''logarithmic integral function''' or '''integral logarithm''' li(''x'') is a [[special function]]. It is relevant in problems of [[physics]] and has [[number theory|number theoretic]] significance. In particular, according to the [[Siegel-Walfisz theorem]] it is a very good [[approximation]] to the [[prime-counting function]], which is defined as the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to a given value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. [[Image:Logarithmic integral function.svg|thumb|right|300px|Logarithmic integral function plot]]

==Integral representation==
The logarithmic integral has an integral representation defined for all positive [[real number]]s {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1 by the [[integral|definite integral]]
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, {{math|ln}} denotes the [[natural logarithm]]. The function {{math|1/(ln ''t'')}} has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at {{math|1=''t'' = 1}}, and the integral for {{math|''x'' &gt; 1}} is interpreted as a [[Cauchy principal value]],
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0+} \left( \int_0^{1-\varepsilon} \frac{dt}{\ln t} + \int_{1+\varepsilon}^x \frac{dt}{\ln t} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Offset logarithmic integral==
The '''offset logarithmic integral''' or '''Eulerian logarithmic integral''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Li}(x) = \int_2^x \frac{dt}{\ln t} = \operatorname{li}(x) - \operatorname{li}(2). &lt;/math&gt;

As such, the integral representation has the advantage of avoiding the singularity in the domain of integration.

==Special values==
The function li(''x'') has a single positive zero; it occurs at ''x'' ≈ 1.45136 92348 83381 05028 39684 85892 02744 94930... {{OEIS2C|A070769}}; this number is known as the [[Ramanujan–Soldner constant]].

−Li(0) = li(2) ≈ 1.045163 780117 492784 844588 889194 613136 522615 578151... {{OEIS2C|A069284}}

This is &lt;math&gt;-(\Gamma\left(0,-\ln 2\right) + i\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(a,x\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[incomplete gamma function]]. It must be understood as the [[Cauchy principal value]] of the function.

==Series representation==
The function li(''x'') is related to the ''[[exponential integral]]'' Ei(''x'') via the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\hbox{li}(x)=\hbox{Ei}(\ln x) , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. This identity provides a series representation of li(''x'') as

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(e^u) = \hbox{Ei}(u) = 
\gamma + \ln |u| + \sum_{n=1}^\infty {u^{n}\over n \cdot n!} 
\quad \text{ for } u \ne 0 \; , &lt;/math&gt;

where γ ≈ 0.57721 56649 01532 ... {{OEIS2C|id=A001620}} is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]. A more rapidly convergent series by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan|Ramanujan]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=LogarithmicIntegral | title=Logarithmic Integral}}&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \operatorname{li}(x) =
 \gamma
 + \ln \ln x
 + \sqrt{x} \sum_{n=1}^\infty
                \frac{ (-1)^{n-1} (\ln x)^n}  {n! \, 2^{n-1}}
                \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \frac{1}{2k+1} .
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- cribbed from Mathworld, which cites
Berndt, B. C. Ramanujan's Notebooks, Part IV. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 126–131, 1994.
--&gt;

==Asymptotic expansion==
The asymptotic behavior for ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(x) = O \left( {x\over \ln x} \right) \; . &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is the [[big O notation]]. The full [[asymptotic expansion]] is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(x) \sim \frac{x}{\ln x} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k!}{(\ln x)^k} &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{li}(x)}{x/\ln x}  \sim  1 + \frac{1}{\ln x} + \frac{2}{(\ln x)^2} + \frac{6}{(\ln x)^3} + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

This gives the following more accurate asymptotic behaviour:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{li}(x) - {x\over \ln x} = O \left( {x\over \ln^2 x} \right) \; . &lt;/math&gt;

As an asymptotic expansion, this series is [[divergent series|not convergent]]: it is a reasonable approximation only if the series is truncated at a finite number of terms, and only large values of ''x'' are employed. This expansion follows directly from the asymptotic expansion for the [[exponential integral]].

This implies e.g. that we can bracket li as:

:&lt;math&gt; 1+\frac{1}{\ln x} &lt; \operatorname{li}(x)  \frac{\ln x}{x} &lt; 1+\frac{1}{\ln x}+\frac{3}{(\ln x)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\ln x \ge 11&lt;/math&gt;.

==Number theoretic significance==
The logarithmic integral is important in [[number theory]], appearing in estimates of the number of [[prime number]]s less than a given value. For example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x)\sim\operatorname{Li}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of primes smaller than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Heston's distinctive voice landed him roles as a film narrator, including ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''. He played the title role in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'' three times and cited it as one of his favorite roles. In the early 1990s, he tried unsuccessfully to revive and direct the show with [[Tom Selleck]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Heston, Charlton: ''In The Arena'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, p. 479; {{ISBN|0-684-80394-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Heston had a cameo role playing himself in the American television series ''[[Friends]]'', in the episode &quot;[[The One with Joey's Dirty Day]]&quot;. In 2000, he played Chief Justice Haden Wainwright in ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode &quot;Final Appeal&quot;.

==Political activism==
[[File:Charlton Heston - 1961 hearing.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Heston at a congressional hearing in 1961]]
Heston's political activism had four stages.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands'', pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, 1955–61, he endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates for president, and signed on to petitions and [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political causes. From 1961 until 1972, the second stage, he continued to endorse Democratic candidates for president. Moving beyond [[Hollywood]], he became nationally visible in 1963 in support of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. From 1965 until 1971, he served as the elected president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], and clashed with his liberal rival [[Ed Asner]]. In 1968, he used his &quot;cowboy&quot; persona to publicize [[gun control]] measures.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The third stage began in 1972. Like many [[neoconservative]]s of the same era who moved from liberal Democrat to conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he rejected the liberalism of [[George McGovern]] and supported [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972 for president. In the 1980s, he gave strong support to [[Ronald Reagan]] during his [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] presidency. In 1995, Heston entered his fourth stage by establishing his own political action fund-raising committee and jumped into the internal politics of the [[National Rifle Association]]. He gave numerous [[culture war]]s speeches and interviews upholding the conservative position, blaming media and academia for imposing [[affirmative action]], which he saw as unfair [[reverse discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven J.

In the 1964 election, he endorsed [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who had masterminded the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] through Congress over the vociferous opposition of [[Southern Democrats]]. That year, Heston publicly opposed [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|California Proposition 14]] that rolled back the state's fair housing law, the [[Rumford Fair Housing Act]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In his 1995 autobiography, ''In the Arena'', written after he became a conservative Republican, Heston wrote that while driving back from the set of ''[[The War Lord]]'', he saw a &quot;[[Barry Goldwater]] for President&quot; billboard with his campaign slogan &quot;In Your Heart You Know He's Right&quot; and thought to himself, &quot;Son of a bitch, he {{em|is}} right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven J.|title=Hollywood Left and Right:How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|location=New York|isbn=978-0195181722|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNma11zsi6MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston later said that his support for Goldwater was the event that helped turn him against gun control laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denning|first=Brandon P.|title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-0313386701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD46JBOhMU0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the assassination of Senator [[Robert F.

By the 1980s, Heston supported [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] and changed his political affiliation from Democratic to Republican. When asked why he changed political alliances, Heston replied &quot;I didn't change. The Democratic Party changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tujw3ajlDMC&amp;pg=PA6|page=6|title=From My Cold, Dead Hands Charlton Heston and American Politics|year=2006|author=Raymond, Emilie|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn=978-0-8131-2408-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he first registered as a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raymond|title=From My Cold, Dead Hands: Charlton Heston and American Politics|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He campaigned for Republicans and Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan,&lt;ref name=Reagan&gt;{{cite news|last=McDowell|first=Charles|title=Charlton Heston, the Gun Lobbyist|work=Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia)|page=B1|date=September 14, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George H.W.

Heston charged that [[CNN]]'s telecasts from Baghdad were &quot;sowing doubts&quot; about the allied effort in the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bobthomas&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Film Legend Charlton Heston Dead at 84|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 6, 2008|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hIhnqF6LygGpQ54CQdntp6c74tTwD8VSHEV81|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409211126/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hIhnqF6LygGpQ54CQdntp6c74tTwD8VSHEV81|archivedate=April 9, 2008|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[Time Warner]] stockholders' meeting, Heston castigated the company for releasing an [[Ice-T]] album which included a song &quot;[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]&quot; about killing police officers. While filming ''[[The Savage (1952 film)|The Savage]]'', Heston was initiated by blood into the [[Miniconjou]] [[Lakota people|Lakota Nation]], saying that he had no natural [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] heritage, but elected to be &quot;Native American&quot; to salvage the term from exclusively referring to American Indians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arena&quot;/&gt;

In a 1997 speech called &quot;Fighting the Culture War in America&quot;, Heston rhetorically deplored a [[culture war]] he said was being conducted by a generation of media people, educators, entertainers, and politicians against:&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the God fearing, law-abiding, [[White people|Caucasian]], [[middle-class]] [[Protestant]]&amp;nbsp;– or even worse, [[evangelical Christian]], [[Midwestern]] or [[Southern United States|Southern]]&amp;nbsp;– or even worse, [[rural]], apparently straight – or even worse, admitted [[heterosexuals]], gun&amp;nbsp;owning – or even worse, [[NRA]]-card-carrying, average working stiff – or even worse, male working stiff&amp;nbsp;– because, not only don't you count, you are a down-right obstacle to [[social progress]]. Your voice deserves a lower [[Decibel#Acoustics|decibel]] level, your opinion is less enlightened, your media access is insignificant; and frankly, mister, you need to wake up, wise up, and learn a little something from your new America; and until you do, would you mind shutting up?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlton Heston Address to Free Congress 20th Anniversary Gala |url=http://www.mcsm.org/heston2.html |website=[[Montgomery Citizens for a Safer Maryland]] |accessdate=5 October 2020 |date=20 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He went on to say:&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was handed down to guide us by a bunch of wise old dead white guys who invented our country! Now some flinch when I say that. Why! It's true... they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s name [[Abolitionism in the United States#American Civil War|opposing slavery in the 1860s]]. So why should I be ashamed of white guys? Why is &quot;Hispanic Pride&quot; or &quot;[[Black Pride]]&quot; a good thing, while &quot;[[White Pride]]&quot; conjures [[Skinhead|shaven heads]] and [[KKK|white hoods]]? Why was the [[Million Man March]] on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the [[Promise Keepers]] March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule? I'll tell you why: Cultural warfare!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an address to students at [[Harvard Law School]] entitled &quot;Winning the Cultural War&quot;, Heston said, &quot;If Americans believed in [[political correctness]], we'd still be [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]'s boys – subjects bound to the British crown.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heston |first1=Charlton |title=Winning the Cultural War |url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/charltonhestonculturalwar.htm |website=[[American Rhetoric]] |accessdate=5 October 2020 |date=16 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said to the students:&lt;blockquote&gt;You are the best and the brightest. You, here in this fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the [[Charles River]]. You are the cream. But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since [[Old North Bridge#&quot;Concord Fight&quot;|Concord Bridge]].

During a speech at [[Brandeis University]], he stated, &quot;Political correctness is tyranny with manners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/heston-champions-second-amendment/ |date=March 29, 2000 |title=Heston Champions Second Amendment |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the [[National Press Club]] in 1997, Heston said, &quot;Now, I doubt any of you would prefer a rolled up newspaper as a weapon against a dictator or a criminal intruder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Dudley Susan.

Heston was the president (a largely ceremonial position) and spokesman of the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] from 1998 until he resigned in 2003. At the 2000 NRA convention, he raised a rifle over his head and declared that a potential [[Al Gore]] administration would take away his [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights &quot;[[from my cold, dead hands]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, ''From My Cold, Dead Hands'', pp 5–7, 241, 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', &quot;Gore fires back after Heston tirade&quot;, June 13, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing his resignation in 2003, he again raised a rifle over his head, repeating the five famous words of his 2000 speech.

In the 2002 film ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', [[Michael Moore]] interviewed Heston at Heston's home, asking him about an April 1999 meeting the NRA held in [[Denver]], Colorado, shortly after the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Moore criticized Heston for the perceived thoughtlessness in the timing and location of the meeting. When Moore asked Heston for his thoughts on why gun-related homicide is so much higher in the United States than in other countries, Heston said it was because, &quot;we have probably more mixed ethnicity&quot; and/or that &quot;we have a history of violence, perhaps more than most countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyar|first=Jay|title=Heston's remarks bring buzz to Moore's documentary |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-09-09/news/0209080050_1_charlton-heston-moore-toronto|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=September 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston subsequently, on-camera, excused himself and walked away.

Heston opposed [[abortion]] and introduced [[Bernard Nathanson]]'s 1987 [[anti-abortion]] documentary, ''[[Eclipse of Reason]]'', which focuses on late-term abortions. Heston served on the advisory board of [[Accuracy in Media]], a conservative media watchdog group founded by [[Reed Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/about/frequently-asked-questions-faq|title=FAQ|publisher=Accuracy in Media|accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, &quot;From start to finish, Heston was a grand, ornery anachronism, the sinewy symbol of a time when Hollywood took itself seriously, when heroes came from history books, not comic books. Epics like ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' or ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' simply couldn't be made today, in part because popular culture has changed as much as political fashion. But mainly because there's no one remotely like Charlton Heston to infuse the form with his stature, fire, and guts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]] (April 10, 2008). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1729693,00.html &quot;Charlton Heston: The Epic Man&quot;], time.com; accessed December 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his obituary for the actor, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted, &quot;Heston made at least three movies that almost everybody eventually sees: ''Ben-Hur'', ''The Ten Commandments'' and ''Planet of the Apes''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080410/PEOPLE/323773696|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=Charlton Heston, Richard Widmark: Tough guys, strong presences|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heston's cinematic legacy was the subject of ''Cinematic Atlas: The Triumphs of Charlton Heston'', an 11-film retrospective by the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center|Film Society]] of the [[Lincoln Center]] that was shown at the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center|Walter Reade Theatre]] from August 29 to September 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale/charltonheston.html|title=Cinematic Atlas: The Triumphs of Charlton Heston|accessdate=September 1, 2008|publisher=Film Society of the Lincoln Center|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901013532/http://www.filmlinc.com/wrt/onsale/charltonheston.html|archivedate=September 1, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2010, Heston was inducted into the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum's Hall of Great Western Performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/info/awards-hof/Western-Performers.aspx|title=Hall of Great Western Performers|accessdate=April 19, 2010|publisher=National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his childhood hometown of [[St. Helen, Michigan]], a charter school, Charlton Heston Academy, opened on September 4, 2012. It is housed in the former St. Helen Elementary School. Enrollment on the first day was 220 students in grades kindergarten through eighth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charltonhestonacademy.com Charlton Heston Academy], charltonhestonacademy.com; retrieved August 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton Heston was commemorated on a United States [[postage stamp]] issued on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uspsstamps.com/stamps/charlton-heston|title=Charlton Heston|website=USPSStamps.com|publisher=United States Postal Service|accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlton Heston was inducted as a Laureate of [[the Lincoln Academy of Illinois]] and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1977 in the area of Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/4632-2/#toggle-id-39|title=Laureates by Year – The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lucca}}

===Ancient and medieval city===
Lucca was founded by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (there are traces of an earlier [[Liguri]]an settlement in the 3rd century BC called ''Luk'' meaning marsh in which the name Lucca originated) and became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony in 180 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;h.f.ullmann&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haegen|first1=Anne Mueller von der|last2=Strasser|first2=Ruth F.|title=Art &amp; Architecture: Tuscany|year=2013|publisher=H.F.Ullmann Publishing|location=Potsdam|isbn=978-3-8480-0321-1|page=57|chapter=Lucca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular grid of its historical centre preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. Traces of the [[amphitheatre]] may still be seen in the [[Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, Lucca|Piazza dell'Anfiteatro]].

At the [[Lucca Conference]], in 56 BC, [[Julius Caesar]], [[Pompey]], and [[Crassus]] reaffirmed their political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h.f.ullmann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, Mary et al. ''The Romans: From Village to Empire'', pg 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frediano]], an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]], was [[bishop of Lucca]] in the early sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;See article on the [[Basilica of San Frediano|Basilica di San Frediano]].&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Lucca was plundered by [[Odoacer]], the first Germanic King of Italy. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the sixth century, when [[Narses]] besieged it for several months in 553. Under the [[Lombards]], it was the seat of a duke who minted his own coins. The [[Holy Face of Lucca]] (or Volto Santo), a major relic supposedly carved by [[Nicodemus]], arrived in 742. During the eighth-tenth centuries Lucca was a center of [[Jewish]] life, the community being led by the [[Kalonymos family]] (which at some point during this time migrated to Germany to become a major component of proto-[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic Jewry]]). Lucca became prosperous through the [[silk]] trade that began in the eleventh century, and came to rival the silks of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. During the tenth–eleventh centuries Lucca was the capital of the feudal [[margraviate of Tuscany]], more or less independent but owing nominal allegiance to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

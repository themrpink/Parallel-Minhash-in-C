====Music====
[[Shel Silverstein]]'s song &quot;The Wonderful Soup Stone&quot; tells a version of this story. [[Bobby Bare]] included the song on his album ''Lullabys, Legends and Lies'' (1973).&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazon entry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bobby Bare Sings Lullabies Legends &amp; Lies|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bobby-Bare-Sings-Lullabies-Legends/dp/B000ROAL8K |access-date=November 23, 2019}},&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show]] included the song on their album ''Belly Up!'' (1973).

A version of the tale written by [[Tom Chapin]] and [[John Forster (musician)|John Forster]] appears on Chapin's album ''Mother Earth'' (1990).

====Television====
*[[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'' series contains one tale called &quot;A Story Short&quot;, in which the Storyteller himself (played by [[John Hurt]]) is the main character. In the beginning, he arrives at a castle where a man is thrown out for begging for food. He proceeds to trick the King's cook into making stone soup. After the people are happily fed, the cook realizes what has happened and pleads with the King to let him boil the Storyteller in oil, but the King instead offers a way out — to tell him a story every day for a year instead.
*The [[PBS Kids]] show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' featured an episode with a version of the story being read. In this version, the strangers were replaced by aliens.
* The tale was adapted as an episode of the show ''[[Hungarian Folktales]]''.
* A [[:ru:Каша из топора|Soviet cartoon]] based on the Russian variant of the tale was made in 1982.
* [[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|The Land of the Lost (1974 TV Series)]] Season 1, Episode 14 is entitled &quot;Stone Soup&quot; in which Marshal (the father) uses Stone Soup to get his children to help gather things for dinner.
* [[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]] Season 8, Episode 13 is entitled &quot;Stone Soup&quot; and has this story as its theme.

===Lucky Iron Fish===
A contemporary twist on &quot;nail soup&quot; helps relieve real-world [[iron deficiency anemia]] in [[Cambodia]]. The [[lucky iron fish|Lucky Iron Fish]] is a [[cast iron]] bar in the shape of the &quot;Try Kantrop&quot; fish that many villagers consider lucky. When immersed into a simmering pot of soup, enough of the iron dissolves into the liquid to add the critical amounts of a trace nutrient needed to prevent certain types of anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/25/434942455/in-cambodia-lucky-iron-fish-for-the-cooking-pot-could-fight-anemia |work=The Salt (NPR Morning Edition) |last=Sullivan |first=Michael |title=In Cambodia, 'Lucky' Iron Fish For The Cooking Pot Could Fight Anemia |date=December 25, 2015 |access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military tactics===
US Army General [[George S. Patton]] referred to the &quot;rock soup method&quot; of acquiring resources for attacks in the face of official disapproval by his superiors for offensive operations. In the military context, he sent units forward, ostensibly on reconnaissance missions, where he knew resistance was to be met. &quot;Surprised&quot; at the enemy resistance, Patton would later request support for his scouts, and these missions eventually turned into small scale probing attacks. Then, once full combat had begun, Paton would request (or make the executive decision to) encircle or push full force against enemy resistance, under the rationale that the reinforcements were either bogged down or unable to retreat. He notably did this during the [[Battle of Sicily]], in the advance on [[Palermo]], and again in the campaign in northwest Europe, notably near [[Metz]] when his [[3rd US Army]] was officially halted during [[Operation Market Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farago |first=Ladislas |title=Patton: Ordeal and Triumph |publisher=Westholme Publishing LLC |year=2005 |location=[[Yardley, Pennsylvania]] |isbn=978-1594160110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large pool located on Karl Johan street in Oslo, funded by the steel company ''Christiania Spigerverk'' (&quot;Christiania Nail Factory&quot;),  is nicknamed ''[[Spikersuppa]]'' (&quot;Nail Soup&quot;) as a humorous reference to the story. {{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

A '''passerine''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|s|ər|aɪ|n}} is any [[bird]] of the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Passeriformes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|s|ə|r|ᵻ|f|ɔr|m|iː|z}}, [[Latin]] ''passer'' (“sparrow”) + ''formis'' (“-shaped”)), which includes more than half of all bird species. Sometimes known as '''perching birds''' or '''songbirds''', passerines are distinguished from other orders of birds by [[Dactyly#In birds|the arrangement of their toes]] (three pointing forward and one back), which facilitates perching.

With more than 140 families and some 6,500 identified species,&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | editor3-last=Rasmussen | editor3-first=Pamela | editor3-link=Pamela Rasmussen | year=2020 | title=Family Index | work=IOC World Bird List Version 10.1 | url=https://www.worldbirdnames.org/classification/family-index/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=26 April 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passeriformes is the largest order of birds and among the most diverse orders of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

Most passerines are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], while the [[shrike]]s are [[carnivore|carnivorous]].

The terms &quot;passerine&quot; and &quot;Passeriformes&quot; are derived from the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the [[house sparrow]], ''Passer domesticus'', and ultimately from the [[Latin]] term ''passer'', which refers to sparrows and similar small birds.

==Description==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The order is divided into three suborders, [[Tyranni]] (suboscines), [[Passeri]] (oscines), and the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] [[Acanthisitti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of Birds: 225 Million Years of Evolution|last=Chatterjee|first=Sankar|publisher=JHU Press|year=2015|isbn=9781421415901|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscines have the best control of their [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]] muscles among birds, producing a wide range of [[Birdsong|songs]] and other vocalizations (though some of them, such as the [[crow]]s, do not sound musical to human beings); some such as the [[lyrebird]] are accomplished imitators. The acanthisittids or [[New Zealand wren]]s are tiny birds restricted to [[New Zealand]], at least in modern times; they were long placed in Passeri.
[[File:PasserinePterylosis.jpg|thumb|right|Pterylosis or the feather tracts in a typical passerine]]

Most passerines are smaller than typical members of other avian orders. The heaviest and altogether largest passerines are the [[thick-billed raven]] and the larger races of [[common raven]], each exceeding {{convert|1.5|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The [[superb lyrebird]] and some [[bird-of-paradise|birds-of-paradise]], due to very long tails or tail coverts, are longer overall. The smallest passerine is the [[short-tailed pygmy tyrant]], at {{convert|6.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.2|g|abbr=on}}.

==Anatomy==
The foot of a passerine has three toes directed forward and one toe directed backward, called [[anisodactyl]] arrangement, and the hind toe ([[hallux]]) joins the leg at approximately the same level as the front toes. This arrangement enables passerine birds to easily perch upright on branches. The toes have no webbing or joining, but in some [[cotinga]]s, the second and third toes are united at their basal third.

The leg of passerine birds contains an additional special adaptation for perching. A tendon in the rear of the leg running from the underside of the toes to the muscle behind the [[tibiotarsus]] will automatically be pulled and tighten when the leg bends, causing the foot to curl and become stiff when the bird lands on a branch. This enables passerines to sleep while perching without falling off.&lt;ref&gt;Stefoff, Rebecca (2008), ''The Bird Class'', Marshall Cavendish Benchmark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, Michael and Birkhead, Tim (1991) ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Ornithology'', Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521362059}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most passerine birds have 12 tail feathers but the [[superb lyrebird]] has 16,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. (2008) &quot;Flight of fancy&quot;. ''Australian Geographic'', (89), 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and several spinetails in the family [[Furnariidae]] have 10, 8, or even 6, as is the case of [[Des Murs's wiretail]]. Species adapted to tree trunk climbing such as [[woodcreeper]] and [[treecreepers]] have stiff tail feathers that are used as props during climbing. Extremely long tails used as sexual ornaments are shown by species in different families. A well-known example is the [[long-tailed widowbird]].

==Eggs and nests==
{{see also|List of brood parasitic passerines}}
The chicks of passerines are [[altricial]]: blind, featherless, and helpless when hatched from their eggs. Hence, the chicks require extensive parental care. Most passerines lay coloured eggs, in contrast with nonpasserines, most of whose eggs are white except in some ground-nesting groups such as [[Charadriiformes]] and [[nightjar]]s, where camouflage is necessary, and in some [[brood parasite|parasitic]] [[cuckoo]]s, which match the passerine host's egg. The [[vinous-throated parrotbill]] has two egg colours, white and blue, to deter the brood parasitic [[common cuckoo]].

Clutches vary considerably in size: some larger passerines of Australia such as lyrebirds and scrub-robins lay only a single egg, most smaller passerines in warmer climates lay between two and five, while in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, hole-nesting species like [[tit (bird)|tits]] can lay up to a dozen and other species around five or six.
The family [[Viduidae]] do not build their own nests, instead, they lay eggs in other birds' nests.

==Origin and evolution==
The evolutionary history of the passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together on the basis of morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of [[convergent evolution]], not a close genetic relationship. For example, the [[Troglodytidae|wrens of the Americas and Eurasia]]; [[Maluridae|those of Australia]]; and [[Acanthisittidae|those of New Zealand]] look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining Passeriformes.{{efn|The name [[wren]] has been applied to other, unrelated birds in Australia and New Zealand. The 27 [[Australasian realm|Australasian]] &quot;wren&quot; species in the family [[Maluridae]] are unrelated, as are the [[New Zealand wren]]s in the family Acanthisittidae; the antwrens in the family [[Thamnophilidae]]; and the wren-babblers of the families [[Timaliidae]], [[Pellorneidae]], and [[Pnoepygidae]]. For the monophyly of the &quot;true wrens&quot;, Troglodytidae, see Barker 2004&lt;ref name=barker04&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barker | first=F.K. | date=2004 | title=Monophyly and relationships of wrens (Aves: Troglodytidae): a congruence analysis of heterogeneous mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=31 |issue=2 | pages=486–504 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.08.005 | pmid=15062790}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Much research remains to be done, but advances in [[molecular biology]] and improved [[paleobiogeography|paleobiogeographical]] data gradually are revealing a clearer picture of passerine origins and evolution that reconciles molecular affinities, the constraints of morphology and the specifics of the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00118.x|title=The evolutionary radiation of modern birds (Neornithes): Reconciling molecules, morphology and the fossil record|date=June 2004|last1=Dyke|first1=Gareth J.|last2=Van Tuinen|first2=Marcel|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=141|issue=2|pages=153–177|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Claramunt &amp; Cracraft 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Claramunt |first1=S. |last2=Cracraft |first2=J. |title=A new time tree reveals Earth history's imprint on the evolution of modern birds |journal=Science Advances |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=e1501005 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501005 |pmc=4730849 |pmid=26824065|bibcode=2015SciA....1E1005C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first passerines are now thought to have evolved in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in the late [[Paleocene]] or early [[Eocene]], around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericson2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1690883|pmid=11839192|date=7 February 2002|last1=Ericson|first1=P.G.|last2=Christidis|first2=L.|last3=Cooper|first3=A.|last4=Irestedt|first4=M.|last5=Jackson|first5=J.|last6=Johansson|first6=U.S.|last7=Norman|first7=J.A.|title=A Gondwanan origin of passerine birds supported by DNA sequences of the endemic New Zealand wrens|volume=269|issue=1488|pages=235–241|doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1877|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Claramunt &amp; Cracraft 2015&quot;/&gt;

The initial split was between the [[New Zealand wren]]s ([[Acanthisittidae]]) and all other passerines, and the second split involved the [[Tyranni]] (suboscines) and the [[Passeri]] (oscines or songbirds). The latter experienced a great radiation of forms out of the [[Australian continent]]. A major branch of the Passeri, [[parvorder]] [[Passerida]], expanded deep into Eurasia and Africa, where a further explosive radiation of new lineages occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Claramunt &amp; Cracraft 2015&quot;/&gt; This eventually led to three major [[Passerida]] lineages comprising about 4,000 species, which in addition to the [[Corvida]] and numerous minor lineages make up songbird diversity today. Extensive [[biogeographical]] mixing happens, with northern forms returning to the south, southern forms moving north, and so on.

That suboscines expanded much beyond their region of origin is proven by several fossil from Germany such as a broadbill ([[Eurylaimidae]]) humerus fragment from the Early [[Miocene]] (roughly 20&amp;nbsp;mya) of [[:de:Wintershof (Eichst%C3%A4tt)|Wintershof]], Germany, the Late Oligocene [[carpometacarpus]] from France listed above, and ''[[Wieslochia]]'', among others.&lt;ref name=manegold04/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Claramunt &amp; Cracraft 2015&quot;/&gt; Extant Passeri super-families were quite distinct by that time and are known since about 12–13 mya when modern genera were present in the corvoidean and basal songbirds. The modern diversity of Passerida genera is known mostly from the Late Miocene onwards and into the [[Pliocene]] (about 10–2&amp;nbsp;mya). [[Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]] [[lagerstätten]] (&lt;1.8&amp;nbsp;mya) yield numerous extant species, and many yield almost nothing but extant species or their [[chronospecies]] and paleosubspecies.

The Passeriformes is currently divided into three suborders: [[Acanthisitti]] (New Zealand wrens), [[Tyranni]] (suboscines) and [[Passeri]] (oscines). The Passeri has been traditionally subdivided into two major groups recognized now as [[Corvida]] and [[Passerida]] respectively containing the large [[Taxonomic rank|superfamilies]] [[Corvoidea]] and [[Meliphagoidea]], as well as minor lineages, and the superfamilies [[Sylvioidea]], [[Muscicapoidea]], and [[Passeroidea]] but this arrangement has been found to be oversimplified. Since the mid-2000s, literally, dozens of studies have investigated the [[phylogeny]] of the Passeriformes and found that many families from [[Australasia]] traditionally included in the Corvoidea actually represent more basal lineages within oscines. Likewise, the traditional three-superfamily arrangement within the Passeri has turned out to be far more complex and will require changes in classification.

Major &quot;[[wastebin taxon|wastebin]]&quot; families such as the [[Old World warbler]]s and [[Old World babbler]]s have turned out to be [[paraphyletic]] and are being rearranged. Several taxa turned out to represent highly distinct lineages, so new families had to be established, some of them – like the [[stitchbird]] of New Zealand and the [[Eurasia]]n [[bearded reedling]] – [[monotypic]] with only one living species.&lt;ref&gt;The former does not even have recognized subspecies, while the latter is one of the most singular birds alive today. Good photos of a bearded reedling are for example [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Reedling_bearded-WEH.jpg here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016043808/http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Reedling_bearded-WEH.jpg |date=16 October 2007 }} and [http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/photos/mraz/bearded-reedling-05a04012.jpg here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731170412/http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/photos/mraz/bearded-reedling-05a04012.jpg |date=31 July 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Passeri alone, a number of minor lineages will eventually be recognized as distinct superfamilies. For example, the [[kinglet]]s constitute a single genus with less than 10 species today but seem to have been among the first perching bird lineages to diverge as the group spread across Eurasia. No particularly close relatives of them have been found among comprehensive studies of the living Passeri, though they might be fairly close to some little-studied tropical Asian groups. [[Nuthatch]]es, [[wren]]s, and their closest relatives as currently grouped in a distinct super-family [[Certhioidea]].
&lt;!--
Regarding references: to avoid cluttering an article that is to appeal the casual reader and the informed layperson, it would be good to cite only sources for splits, not arguments for or against placing taxa incertae sedis here or there. Also, there will be loads and loads of comprehensive reviews out soon one would expect, and it would pay to wait rather than citing the entire list from the talk page.

Discussing the possible affinities of disputed taxa should go to their respective page, and the studies used to date can be cited more appropriately in the suborder and super-family articles that in any case are more of interest to the specialist reader and can well reflect this.

This list is in taxonomic order, placing related families next to one another. The families listed are those recognised by the [[International Ornithologists' Union]] (IOC).&lt;ref name=ioc/&gt; The order and the division into infraorders, parvorders and superfamilies follows the phylogenetic analysis published by Carl Oliveros and colleagues in 2019.&lt;ref name=oliveros&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Oliveros | first1=C.H. | display-authors=etal | year=2019 | title=Earth history and the passerine superradiation | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=116 | issue=16 | pages=7916–7925 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1813206116 | pmid=30936315 | doi-access=free | pmc=6475423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Oliveros et al (2019) use the list of families published by Dickinson and Christidis in 2014.&lt;ref name=oliveros/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | editor-last1=Dickinson | editor-first1=E.C. | editor1-link=Edward C.

No species in the family [[Teretistridae]] was sampled by Oliveros et al so its position is uncertain.&lt;ref name=ioc/&gt;&lt;ref name=oliveros/&gt;}} The relationships between the families in the suborder Tyranni (suboscines) were all well determined but some of the nodes in Passeri (oscines) were unclear owing to the rapid splitting of the lineages.&lt;ref name=oliveros/&gt;

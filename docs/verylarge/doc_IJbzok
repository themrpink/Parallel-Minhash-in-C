The first Chinese immigrants arrived in 1820, according to U.S. government records. 325 men are known to have arrived before the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]],&lt;ref&gt;Bill Bryson, ''Made In America'', page 154&lt;/ref&gt; which drew the first significant number of laborers from China who mined for gold and performed menial labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangers28&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers From a Different Shore|author=Ronald Takaki|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-316-83109-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/strangersfromdif00taka/page/28 28]|authorlink=Ronald Takaki|url=https://archive.org/details/strangersfromdif00taka/page/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang34-35&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese in America|author=Iris Chang|year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-670-03123-8|pages=34–35|authorlink=Iris Chang|title-link=The Chinese in America (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwong44&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese America|author=Peter Kwong and Dusanka Miscevic|publisher=[[The New Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-56584-962-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/chineseamericaun00pete/page/44 44]|url=https://archive.org/details/chineseamericaun00pete/page/44}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 25,000 immigrants by 1852, and 105,465 by 1880, most of whom lived on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. They formed over a tenth of California's population. Nearly all of the early immigrants were young males with low educational levels from [[Greater Taishan Region|six districts]] in [[Guangdong Province]].&lt;ref name=historyworld&gt;International World History Project. [http://history-world.org/asian_americans.htm Asian Americans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527055848/http://history-world.org/asian_americans.htm |date=27 May 2011 }}.

In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry. Chinese immigrants were particularly instrumental in building railroads in the U.S. west, and as Chinese laborers grew successful in the United States, a number of them became entrepreneurs in their own right. As the numbers of Chinese laborers increased, so did the strength of anti-Chinese attitude among other workers in the U.S. economy. This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China through the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/chinese-immigration|title=Milestones: 1866–1898 – Office of the Historian|website=History.state.gov|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese came to California in large numbers during the California Gold Rush, with 40,400 being recorded as arriving from 1851 to 1860, and again in the 1860s, when the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] recruited large labor gangs, many on five-year contracts, to build its portion of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]]. The Chinese laborers worked out well and thousands more were recruited until the railroad's completion in 1869. Chinese labor provided the massive workforce needed to build the majority of the Central Pacific's difficult route through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains and across [[Nevada]]. By 1869, the ethnic Chinese population in the U.S. numbered at least 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/our-composite-nationality/|title=Our Composite Nationality|website=Teaching American History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativist objections to Chinese immigration to the U.S. took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there. At the same time, they also had to repay loans to the Chinese merchants who paid their passage to North America. These financial pressures left them little choice but to work for whatever wages they could. Non-Chinese laborers often required much higher wages to support their wives and children in the United States, and also generally had a stronger political standing to bargain for higher wages. Therefore, many of the non-Chinese workers in the United States came to resent the Chinese laborers, who might squeeze them out of their jobs. Furthermore, as with most immigrant communities, many Chinese settled in their own neighborhoods, and tales spread of Chinatowns as places where large numbers of Chinese men congregated to visit prostitutes, smoke tobacco, or gamble. Some advocates of anti-Chinese legislation therefore argued that admitting Chinese into the United States lowered the cultural and moral standards of American society. Others used a more overtly racist argument for limiting immigration from East Asia, and expressed concern about the integrity of American racial composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

To address these rising social tensions, from the 1850s through the 1870s the California state government passed a series of measures aimed at Chinese residents, ranging from requiring special licenses for Chinese businesses or workers to preventing naturalization. Because anti-Chinese discrimination and efforts to stop Chinese immigration violated the 1868 Burlingame-Seward Treaty with China, the federal government was able to negate much of this legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

The Chinese population rose from 2,716 in 1851 to 63,000 by 1871. In the decade 1861–70, 64,301 were recorded as arriving, followed by 123,201 in 1871–80 and 61,711 in 1881–1890. 77% were located in California, with the rest scattered across the West, the South, and [[New England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;takaki&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Strangers From A Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans| last=Takaki| first=Ronald|year=1998| publisher=Back Bay Books| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most came from [[Southern China]] looking for a better life to escape a high poverty as a result of the [[Taiping Rebellion]].

In 1879, advocates of immigration restriction succeeded in introducing and passing legislation in Congress to limit the number of Chinese arriving to fifteen per ship or vessel. Republican [[President Rutherford B. Hayes]] vetoed the bill because it violated U.S. treaty agreements with China. Nevertheless, it was still an important victory for advocates of exclusion. Democrats, led by supporters in the West, advocated for all-out exclusion of Chinese immigrants. Although Republicans were largely sympathetic to western concerns, they were committed to a platform of free immigration. In order to placate the western states without offending China, President Hayes sought a revision of the Burlingame-Seward Treaty ([[Burlingame Treaty]]) in which China agreed to limit immigration to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

In 1880, the Hayes Administration appointed U.S. diplomat [[James B. Angell]] to negotiate a new treaty with China. The resulting [[Angell Treaty of 1880|Angell Treaty]] permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years. The Act also required every Chinese person traveling in or out of the country to carry a certificate identifying his or her status as a laborer, scholar, diplomat, or merchant. The 1882 Act was the first in American history to place broad restrictions on immigration.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

For American presidents and Congressmen addressing the question of Chinese exclusion, the challenge was to balance domestic attitudes and politics, which dictated an anti-Chinese policy, while maintaining good diplomatic relations with China, where exclusion would be seen as an affront and a violation of treaty promises. The domestic factors ultimately trumped international concerns. In 1888, Congress took exclusion even further and passed the Scott Act, which made reentry to the United States after a visit to China impossible, even for long-term legal residents. The Chinese Government considered this act a direct insult, but was unable to prevent its passage. In 1892, Congress voted to renew exclusion for ten years in the Geary Act, and in 1902, the prohibition was expanded to cover Hawaii and the Philippines, all over strong objections from the Chinese Government and people. Congress later extended the Exclusion Act indefinitely.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

The initial immigration group may have been as high as 90% male due to the Chinese Exclusion act, resulting in most immigrants coming with the thought of earning money, and then returning to China to start a family. Those that stayed in America faced the lack of suitable Chinese brides, because Chinese women were not allowed to immigrate to the US in significant numbers after 1872. As a result, many isolated mostly-bachelor communities slowly aged in place with very low Chinese birth rates. Later, as a result of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the 1898 ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' Supreme Court decision, ethnic Chinese born in the United States became [[U.S. citizen|American citizens]].

The Chinese Exclusion Acts were not repealed until 1943, and then only in the interests of aiding the morale of a wartime ally during World War II. With relations already complicated by the Treaties of Wangxia and Tianjian, the increasingly harsh restrictions on Chinese immigration, combined with the [[Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|rising discrimination against Chinese living in the United States]] in the 1870s-early 1900s, placed additional strain on the diplomatic relationship between the United States and China.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.state.gov&quot;/&gt;

In the mid 1850s, 70 to 150 Chinese were living in New York City and 11 of them married Irish women. In 1906, ''[[The New York Times]]'' (6 August) reported that 300 white women ([[Irish Americans]]) were married to Chinese men in New York, with many more cohabited. In 1900, based on Liang research, of the 120,000 men in more than 20 Chinese communities in the United States, he estimated that one out of every twenty Chinese men (Cantonese) was married to white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benson Tong|title=Asian American children: a historical handbook and guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uK6xhcu-4hAC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=2 March 2012|year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33042-1|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s census showed 3500 Chinese men married to white women and 2900 Chinese women married to white men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-im2X0hbpv8C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Chinese+men+white+women+3500+++america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yy2XUb_ZM4HgOO2lgdgE&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20men%20white%20women%203500%20%20%20america&amp;f=false Love's revolution: interracial marriage] by Maria P.P.

During and after [[World War II]], severe immigration restrictions were eased as the United States allied with China against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[expansionist nationalism|expansionism]]. Later reforms in the 1960s placed increasing value on family unification, allowing relatives of U.S. citizens to receive preference in immigration.

Also on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], [[Greater Boston]] and the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] have significant Chinese American communities, with Chinatowns in [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston]] and [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] hosting important and diverse cultural centers. Significant populations can also be found in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], with [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]], being 3.9% and 2.4% Chinese American, respectively. [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston's Chinatown]] is the only historical Chinese neighborhood within [[New England]]. The Boston suburb of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] also has a prominent Chinese American population, especially within the [[North Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|North Quincy]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;American FactFinder&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212213701/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2020|title=American FactFinder|publisher=United States Census Bureau |year=2010 |accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[San Francisco]], California has the highest [[per capita]] concentration of Chinese Americans of any major city in the United States, at an estimated 21.4%, or 172,181 people, and contains the second-largest total number of Chinese Americans of any U.S. city. San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] was established in the 1840s, making it the oldest Chinatown in [[North America]] and one of the largest neighborhoods of Chinese people outside of Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatownology.com/usa.html|title=USA|website=Chinatownology.com|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.community.ups.com/Community/Community+Internship+Program/San+Francisco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823095900/http://www.community.ups.com/Community/Community+Internship+Program/San+Francisco |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 August 2010 |title=Intern program|website=community.ups.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed in large part by immigrants hailing from [[Guangdong province]] and also many from [[Hong Kong]]. The San Francisco neighborhoods of [[Sunset District]] and [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond District]] also contain significant Chinese populations.

In addition to the big cities, smaller pockets of Chinese Americans are also dispersed in rural towns, often university-college towns, throughout the United States. For example, the number of Chinese Americans, including college professors, doctors, professionals, and students, has increased over 200% from 2005 to 2010 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], a small city with a large number of colleges.

Income and social status of these Chinese-American locations vary widely. A third of a million Chinese Americans are not United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/what-chinas-talking-about-today-is-american-citizenship-still-desirable/254070/ |title=What China's Talking About Today: Is American Citizenship Still Desirable? |last1=Hayoun |first1=Massoud |date=7 March 2012 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Chinese Americans in [[Chinatown]]s of large cities are often members of an impoverished working class, others are well-educated upper-class people living in affluent suburbs. The upper and lower-class Chinese are also widely separated by social status and class discrimination. In California's [[San Gabriel Valley]], for example, the cities of [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]] and [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] are both Chinese American communities lying geographically close to each other but they are separated by a large socioeconomic gap.

==Social status and assimilation==
Some noteworthy historical Chinese contributions include building the western half of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], and levees in the [[Sacramento River Delta]]; the popularization of [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese American food]]; and the introduction of Chinese and [[East Asian people|East Asian]] culture to America, such as [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Kung fu]].

Chinese immigrants to the United States brought many of their ideas and values with them. Some of these have continued to influence later generations. Among them are [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[filial piety|respect for elders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu&quot;&gt;Haiming Liu (2005) &quot;Asian-American Ideas (Cultural Migration)&quot; ''In'' Horowitz, Maryanne Cline (editor) (2005) ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' Charles Scribner's Sons, Detroit, Michigan, volume 1, pp. 158–160, {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, education and the civil service were the most important path for upward social mobility in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Kirk (21 August 2008) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4DA113AF932A1575BC0A96E9C8B63 &quot;Among Chinese-Americans, a Split on Sports&quot;] ''The New York Times'' page B-2&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show about Asian Americans was ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' which premiered on Broadway in 1958;&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Misha.

In most American cities with significant Chinese populations, the new year is celebrated with cultural festivals and other celebrations. In [[Seattle]], the [[Festál#China: Chinese Culture and Arts Festival|Chinese Culture and Arts Festival]] is held every year. Other important festivals include the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].

Analysis indicated that most non-Asian Americans do not differentiate between Chinese Americans and East Asian Americans generally, and perceptions of both groups are nearly identical.&lt;ref name=c100&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.committee100.org/media/media_eng/042501.html |author=Committee of 100 |title=Committee of 100 Announces Results of Landmark National Survey on American Attitudes towards Chinese Americans and Asian Americans |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=14 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929153746/http://www.committee100.org/media/media_eng/042501.html |archive-date=29 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that one fourth of the respondents had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/04/27/MN199998.DTL |author=Matthew Yi |title=Asian Americans seen negatively |accessdate=14 June 2007 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=27 April 2001|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as entrepreneurs (77%); high value on education (67%).&lt;ref name=c100/&gt;

Early Chinese Americans struggled to survive in the United States because of discrimination and stereotypes. In 1871, [[Chinese massacre of 1871|17–20 Chinese immigrants]] were murdered in Los Angeles by a mob of around 500 men. This racially motivated massacre was one of the largest mass lynchings in United States, and took place after the accidental killing of Robert Thompson, a local [[rancher]].

The [[Rock Springs massacre]] occurred in 1885, in which at least 28 Chinese immigrants were killed and 15 were injured. Many enraged white miners in Sweetwater County felt threatened by the Chinese and blamed them for their unemployment. As a result of the job competition, white miners expressed their frustration in physical violence where they robbed, shot, and stabbed at Chinese in Chinatown. The Chinese quickly tried to flee but in doing so, many ended up burned alive in their homes, starved to death in hidden refuge, or exposed to animal predators of the mountains; some were successfully rescued by a passing train. A total of 78 homes were burned.

During the [[Hells Canyon massacre]] in 1887, at least 34 Chinese miners were killed. An accurate account of the event is still unclear, but it is speculated that the dead Chinese miners were victims of gun shot wounds during a robbery committed by a gang of seven armed horse thieves.

Other acts of violence against Chinese immigrants include the [[San Francisco riot of 1877]], the [[Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885|Issaquah]] and [[Tacoma riot of 1885]], the [[Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885|attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers]] in 1885, the [[Seattle riot of 1886]], and the [[Pacific Coast race riots of 1907]]. With the spread of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], which started in the city of Wuhan, China, [[List of incidents of xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic#North America|incidents of xenophobia and racism]] against Chinese people and those perceived as being Chinese has been reported.

==Languages==
{{Main|Chinese language and varieties in the United States}}
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the various [[varieties of Chinese]], collectively referred to as just [[Chinese language|Chinese]], is the third most-spoken language in the United States. It is almost completely spoken within Chinese American populations and by immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lai | first = H. Mark | title = Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions | publisher = AltaMira Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-7591-0458-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2 million Americans speak some variety or dialect of Chinese, with [[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin) becoming increasingly common due to immigration from China and supplanting the previous widespread [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lai&quot;/&gt;

In [[New York City]] at least, although [[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin) is spoken as a native language among only 10% of American born Chinese speakers, it is used as a secondary dialect to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = García | first = Ofelia |author2=Fishman, Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-11-017281-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the immigration from [[Fuzhou]], [[Fujian]] brings in a significant populace of [[Fuzhou people]] ([[Eastern Min]]), particularly [[Changle dialect]] speakers to major cities like New York City, San Francisco, and Boston. People who comes from Fujian ([[Minnan region]]), [[Chaoshan]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asia]] mainly use [[Southern Min|Southern Min dialect]] ([[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) as their mother tongue. Varieties of [[Wu Chinese]], particularly [[Shanghainese]] and the mutually unintelligible [[Wenzhounese]], are now spoken by a minority of recent Chinese immigrants hailing from [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], and [[Shanghai]].

Although Chinese Americans grow up learning [[English language|English]], some teach their children Chinese for a variety of reasons: preservation of an ancient civilization, preservation of a group identity, preservation of their cultural ancestry, desire for easy communication with each other and their relatives, and the perception that Chinese is a very useful language, regardless of China's economic strength. The official standard for United States public notices and signage is Traditional Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, https://www.irs.gov/irm/part22/irm_22-031-001.html ([[Internal Revenue Manual]] 22.31.1.6.3 – &quot;The standard language for translation is Traditional Chinese.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese American community is different from the rest of the population in that the majority of Chinese Americans do not report a [[religious affiliation]]. 43% of Chinese Americans switched to a different religion and 54% stayed within their childhood religion within their lifetime. According to the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2012 Asian-American Survey, 52% of Chinese Americans aged 15 and over said that they did not have any religious affiliation. This is also compared with the religious affiliation of Asian American average of 26% and a national average of 19%.

Of the survey respondents, 15% were [[Buddhist]], 8% were Catholic, and 22% belonged to a [[Protestant]] denomination. Fully half of Chinese Americans (52%)—including 55% of those born in the U.S. and 51% of those born overseas—describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated. Because Chinese Americans are the largest subgroup of Asian Americans, nearly half of all religiously unaffiliated Asians in the U.S. are of Chinese descent (49%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pewforum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;projects.pewforum.org&quot;/&gt;

There are also many Chinese who identify as Jewish, mainly because of the higher marriage rates of Jews and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pine |first1=Dan |title=When you're Asian and Jewish, you get questions |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2015/03/06/when-youre-asian-and-jewish-you-get-questions/ |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=[[J.

There is a significantly higher percentage of Chinese Christians in the United States than there is in China, as a large amount of Chinese Christians fled and are still fleeing to the United States under Communist persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/c09b2ee4b71540c8a7fd6178820c5970|title=Group: Officials destroying crosses, burning bibles in China|date=10 September 2018|website=AP NEWS|access-date=9 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/freedom-of-religion-in-china-a-historical-perspective|title=Freedom of Religion in China: A Historical Perspective|last=University|first=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|access-date=9 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese fled to the United States in the mid-1900s, bringing with them the church organization format that had been brought to them by Western missionaries years before, with the structure almost perfectly preserved. Due to this, there is a large amount of Chinese churches in the United States that are much more similar to earlier Christian churches than American churches themselves, which have generally evolved into a more laid back and carefree environment to accommodate the younger generations.

==Politics==
Chinese Americans are divided among many subgroups based on factors such as age, nativity, and [[socioeconomic status]] and politics between China and the United States, or about [[Chinese nationalism]]. Different subgroups of Chinese Americans also have radically different and sometimes very conflicting political priorities and goals.

In 2013, Chinese Americans were the least likely Asian American ethnicity to be affiliated with a political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asian-American Vote Reveals Nuances |author=Matthew Hilburn |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/polling-asian-americans-nuanced/1586148.html |publisher=Voice of America |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013 |quote=Chinese-Americans were the least likely to affiliate with a party. Magpantay suggested that only one third of Chinese-Americans belong to a party, compared with 71% among all Asian-Americans, because of the negative association of the word party with the Communist Party in China. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Chinese Americans are clustered in majority-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] states and have increasingly voted Democratic in recent presidential elections, following the trend for Asian Americans in general, excluding the [[Vietnamese Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-power-of-the-asian-american-vote-is-growing-and-it-s-up-for-grabs-20121025 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231109/http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-power-of-the-asian-american-vote-is-growing-and-it-s-up-for-grabs-20121025 |date=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling just before the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 U.S. Presidential Election]] found [[John Kerry]] was favored by 58% of Chinese Americans and [[George W.

Chinese Americans were an important source of funds for Han revolutionaries during the later [[Qing dynasty]], and [[Sun Yat-sen]] was raising money in America at the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which established the Republic of China. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Chinese Americans, as [[overseas Chinese]] in general, were viewed as [[capitalism|capitalist]] traitors by the PRC government. This attitude changed dramatically in the late 1970s with the reforms of [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Increasingly, Chinese Americans were seen as sources of business and technical expertise and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] who could aid in China's [[Economic development|economic]] and other [[International development|development]].

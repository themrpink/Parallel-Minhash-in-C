Lear's limericks were often typeset in three or four lines, according to the space available under the accompanying picture.

==Variations==

[[File:Haptic limerick.jpg|thumb|&quot;Amstaff named Yoko from Zgierz&quot; haptic limerick by Witold Szwedkowski as an example of [[haptic poetry]]]]

The limerick form is so well known that it has been parodied in many ways. The following example is of unknown origin:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was a young man from Japan
Whose limericks never would scan.
: And when they asked why,
: He said &quot;I do try!
But when I get to the last line I try to fit in as many words as I can.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

Other parodies deliberately break the rhyme scheme, like the following example, attributed to [[W.S. Gilbert]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was an old man of St. Bees,
Who was stung in the arm by a wasp,
: When asked, &quot;Does it hurt?&quot;
: He replied, &quot;No, it doesn't,
I'm so glad it wasn't a hornet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA683|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature|year=1995|publisher=|isbn=9780877790426|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells 1903, pp. xix-xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

Comedian [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]] has also parodied Lear's style:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
There was an old man with a beard,
A funny old man with a beard
: He had a big beard
: A great big old beard
That amusing old man with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/02/craig-brown-lost-diaries-parody|title=Craig Brown: The Lost Diaries|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

The British wordplay and recreational mathematics expert [[Leigh Mercer]] (1893–1977) devised the following mathematical limerick:
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; \frac{12 + 144 + 20 + 3 \sqrt{4}}{7} + (5 \times 11) = 9^2+0&lt;/math&gt;
This is read as follows:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
A [[dozen]], a [[Gross (unit)|gross]], and a [[20 (number)|score]]
Plus three times the square root of four
: Divided by seven
: Plus five times eleven
Is nine squared and not a bit more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/mayhem.htm |title=Math Mayhem |publisher=lockhaven.edu|date= |accessdate=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

'''Overseas Chinese''' ({{zh|s=海外华人/海外中国人|t=海外華人/海外中國人|p=Hǎiwài Huárén/Hǎiwài Zhōngguórén|first=t}}) are people of ethnic [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] birth who reside outside the territories of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), its [[special administrative regions]] (SARs) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], as well as the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC or Taiwan).

== Terminology ==
'''{{zh |p = Huáqiáo |labels = no}}''' ({{zh|s=华侨|t=華僑}}) or ''Hoan-kheh'' in [[Hokkien]], refers to people of Chinese birth{{Clarify|reason=Born in China or born to a Chinese person? How does this differ from 华裔?|date=August 2020}} residing outside of either the PRC or Taiwan. At the end of the 19th century, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] of China realized that the overseas Chinese could be an asset, a source of foreign investment and a bridge to overseas knowledge; thus, it began to recognize the use of the term Huaqiao.&lt;ref name=&quot;wang&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Gungwu|title=Upgrading the migrant: neither huaqiao nor huaren|date=19 December 1994|publisher=Chinese Historical Society of America|location=Chinese America: History and Perspectives 1996|isbn=978-0-9614198-9-9|page=4|quote=In its own way, it [Chinese government] has upgraded its migrants from a ragbag of malcontents, adventurers, and desperately poor laborers to the status of respectable and valued nationals whose loyalty was greatly appreciated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ching-Sue Kuik renders {{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|huáqiáo}} in English as &quot;the Chinese [[wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]&quot; and writes that the term is &quot;used to disseminate, reinforce, and perpetuate a monolithic and essentialist Chinese identity&quot; by both the PRC and the ROC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChingSueKuik&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kuik|first=Ching-Sue (Gossamer)|year=2013|title=Un/Becoming Chinese: Huaqiao, The Non-perishable Sojourner Reinvented, and Alterity of Chineseness|degree=PhD|chapter=Introduction|page=2|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|oclc=879349650|chapter-url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/23534/Kuik_washington_0250E_12080.pdf|access-date=5 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005190404/https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/23534/Kuik_washington_0250E_12080.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern informal internet term '''{{zh |p = [[haigui]] |labels = no}}''' ({{zh|s=海归|t=海歸}}) refers to returned overseas Chinese and ''guīqiáo qiáojuàn'' ({{zh|s=归侨侨眷|t=歸僑僑眷}}) to their returning relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barabantseva&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Who Are 'Overseas Chinese Ethnic Minorities'?

'''{{zh |p = Huáyì |labels = no}}''' ({{zh|s=华裔|t=華裔|poj=Hôa-è|c=|p=}}) refers to people of Chinese origin residing outside of China, regardless of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Pan|editor1-first=Lynn|editor1-link=Lynn Pan|article=Huaqiao|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|date=April 1999|access-date=17 March 2009|isbn=0674252101|lccn=98035466|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/reference/panenc/huaqiao.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317060519/http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/reference/panenc/huaqiao.html|archive-date=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another often-used term is 海外華人 (Hǎiwài Huárén). It is often used by the [[Government of China|Government of the People's Republic of China]] to refer to people of Chinese ethnicities who live outside the PRC, regardless of citizenship (they can become citizens of the country outside China by naturalization).[[File:San Francisco China Town MC.jpg|thumb|唐人街 (informally, Chinese St) is the name the Chinese emigrants used for Sacramento St in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]]]]
Overseas Chinese who are ethnically Han Chinese, such as [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Hoochew Chinese|Hoochew]], [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] or [[Teochew people|Teochew]] refer to themselves as {{Lang-zh|c=唐人|labels=no}} (Tángrén), pronounced ''tòhng yàn'' in [[Cantonese]], ''toung ning'' in [[Hoochew Chinese|Hoochew]], ''Tn̂g-lâng'' in [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] and ''tong nyin'' in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]. Literally, it means ''Tang people'', a reference to [[Tang dynasty]] China when it was ruling [[China proper]]. This term is commonly used by the [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Hoochew Chinese|Hoochew]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] as a colloquial reference to the Chinese people and has little relevance to the ancient dynasty.  For example, in the early 1850s when Chinese shops opened on Sacramento St in San Francisco, the Chinese emigrants, mainly from the Pearl River Delta west of Canton, called it ''Tang People Street'' ({{Lang-zh|c=唐人街|s=|t=|p=Tángrén Jiē}});&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoy |first1=William J |title=Chinatown derives its own street names |journal=California Folklore Quarterly |volume=2 |year=1943 |issue=April |pages=71–75|doi=10.2307/1495551 |jstor=1495551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yung2006&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} and the settlement became known as ''Tang People Town'' ({{Lang-zh|c=唐人埠|s=|t=|p=Tángrén Bù}}) or Chinatown, which in Cantonese is ''Tong Yun Fow''.&lt;ref name=&quot;yung2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yung |first1=Judy and the Chinese Historical Society of America |title=San Francisco's Chinatown |date=2006 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=978-07385-3130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–40}}

The term '''{{zh|p=shǎoshù mínzú|labels=no}}''' ({{zh|s=少数民族|t=少數民族}}) is added to the various terms for the overseas Chinese to indicate those who would be considered [[ethnic minorities in China]]. The terms '''{{zh|p=shǎoshù mínzú huáqiáo huárén|labels=no}}''' and '''{{zh|p=shǎoshù mínzú hǎiwài qiáobāo|labels=no}}''' ({{zh|s=少数民族海外侨胞|t=少數民族海外僑胞}}) are all in usage.

==History==
{{Main|Chinese emigration}}

The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the [[Ming dynasty]] when [[Zheng He]] (1371–1435) became the envoy of Ming. He sent people&amp;nbsp;– many of them [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]]&amp;nbsp;– to [[Treasure voyages|explore and trade]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in the [[Indian Ocean]].

===Waves of immigration in late Qing Dynasty===
[[File:Chinatown Melbourne at night in September 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown in Little Burke Street, Melbourne, Australia]]
[[File:ChineseMigration003.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Chinese migration from the 1800s to 1949.]]

Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, South America, South Africa, and Europe. In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great Chinese diaspora began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers. Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K. Norton. 7th ed. Chicago, A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., 1924. Chapter XXIV, pp. 283–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing Empire was forced to allow its subjects to work overseas under colonial powers. Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction. Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855–1867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong. After [[World War II]] many people from the [[New Territories]] in [[Hong Kong]] emigrated to the UK (mainly England) and to the Netherlands to earn a better living.

Interestingly, during the early and mid-19th century the anthropometric indicators, namely height of the overseas Chinese was close to the parameters of [[Southern Europeans]]. Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161–164&amp;nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen. Hence, [[emigrants]] from [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]] were shorter than some Chinese [[prisoner]]s who used to live in the [[U.S.]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=Jörg |title=Anthropometric Trends in Southern China, 1830-1864 |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2008 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=209–226|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8446.2008.00238.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When China was under the imperial rule of the [[Qing Dynasty]], subjects who left the [[Qing Empire]] without the Administrator's consent were considered to be traitors and were executed. Their family members faced consequences as well. However, the establishment of the [[Lanfang Republic]] ({{zh|t=蘭芳共和國|p=Lánfāng Gònghéguó}}) in [[West Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], as a [[tributary state]] of Qing China, attests that it was possible to attain permission.{{dubious|date=September 2018}} The republic lasted until 1884, when it fell under [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch occupation]] as Qing influence waned.

===Republic of China===
Under the administration of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China from 1912 to 1949]], these rules were abolished and many migrated outside the Republic of China, mostly through the coastal regions via the ports of [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]], [[Hainan]] and [[Shanghai]]. These migrations are considered to be among the largest in China's history. Many nationals of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] fled and settled down in [[South East Asia]] mainly between the years 1911–1949, after the [[Nationalist government]] led by [[Kuomintang]] lost to the Communist Party of China in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. Most of the nationalist and neutral refugees fled Mainland China to [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]]) as well as [[Taiwan]] (Republic of China). Many nationalists who stayed behind were persecuted or even executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pike&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Pike|first=John|title=Chinese Civil War|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/chinese-civil-war.htm|publisher=Global Security|access-date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarawakiana&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiang Kai Shiek| url=http://sarawakiana.blogspot.com/2008/08/chiang-kai-shek-or-chiang-chung-cheng.html|publisher=Sarawakiana|access-date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War 2===
Most of the Chinese who fled during 1912–1949 under the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] settled down in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] and automatically gained citizenship in 1957 and 1963 as these countries gained independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ching Fatt|title=The Kuomintang Movement in British Malaya, 1912–1949|url=http://www.asianhistorybooks.com/malaysia/the-kuomintang-movement-in-british-malaya-1912-1949/|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|access-date=29 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110140047/http://www.asianhistorybooks.com/malaysia/the-kuomintang-movement-in-british-malaya-1912-1949/|archive-date=10 November 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Kah Kee|title=The Making of an Overseas Chinese Legend|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company|doi=10.1142/8692|year=2013|isbn=978-981-4447-89-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuomintang]] members who settled in Malaysia and Singapore played a major role in the establishment of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] and their meeting hall at [[Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall|Sun Yat Sen Villa]].

During the 1950s and 1960s, the ROC tended to seek the support of overseas Chinese communities through branches of the [[Kuomintang]] based on [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s use of [[expatriate]] Chinese communities to raise money for his revolution. During this period, the People's Republic of China tended to view overseas Chinese with suspicion as possible [[capitalism|capitalist]] infiltrators and tended to value relationships with Southeast Asian nations as more important than gaining support of overseas Chinese, and in the [[Bandung declaration]] explicitly stated{{where|date=June 2020}} that overseas Chinese owed primary loyalty to their home nation.{{dubious|date=June 2020}}

From the mid-20th century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada, Brazil, The United Kingdom, New Zealand, Argentina and the nations of Western Europe; as well as to Peru, Panama, and to a lesser extent to Mexico. Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world. The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice. In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}

In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations. In 2014, author [[Howard W. French|Howard French]] estimated that over one million Chinese have moved in the past 20 years to Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;africamove&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=French|first1=Howard|year=2014|title=China's Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2014-10-17/chinas-second-continent-how-million-migrants-are-building-new|magazine=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent Chinese presences have developed in Europe, where they number well over 1 million, and in Russia, they number over 200,000, concentrated in the [[Russian Far East]]. Russia's main Pacific port and naval base of [[Vladivostok]], once closed to foreigners and belonged to China until the late 19th century, {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} bristles with Chinese markets, restaurants and trade houses.

In Europe, North America and Oceania, occupations are diverse and impossible to generalize; ranging from catering to significant ranks in [[medicine]], [[the arts]] and [[academia]].

Overseas Chinese often send [[remittance]]s back home to family members to help better them financially and socioeconomically. China ranks second after India of top remittance-receiving countries in 2018 with over US$67 billion sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India to retain top position in remittances with $80 billion: World Bank|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=8 December 2018|url=https://m.economictimes.com/nri/forex-and-remittance/india-to-retain-top-position-in-remittances-with-80-billion-world-bank/articleshow/66998062.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assimilation===

Chinese diaspora vary widely as to their degree of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], their interactions with the surrounding communities (see [[Chinatown]]) and their relationship with China.

Thailand has the largest overseas Chinese community and is also the most successful case of [[Thaification|assimilation]], with many claiming [[Thai people|Thai]] identity. For over 400 years, Thai Chinese have largely intermarried and/or assimilated with their compatriots. The present royal house of Thailand, the [[Chakri Dynasty]], was founded by King [[Rama I]] who himself was partly Chinese. His predecessor, King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]], was the son of a Chinese immigrant from Guangdong Province and was born with a Chinese name. His mother, Lady Nok-iang (Thai: นกเอี้ยง), was [[Thai people|Thai]] (and was later awarded the [[Thai royal and noble titles#Feudal lifetime titles|feudal title]] of Somdet Krom Phra Phithak Thephamat).

In the Philippines, Chinese, known as the [[Sangley]], from [[Fujian]] and Guangdong were already migrating to the islands, as early as the 9th century in precolonial to [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish and American colonial times]] and have largely intermarried with both indigenous Filipinos and [[Spanish Filipino|Spanish colonisers]]. Early presence of [[chinatown]]s in overseas communities start to appear in Spanish colonial Philippines, around as early as 1583 (or even earlier), in the form of [[Parián (Manila)|Parians]] in Manila, where Chinese merchants were allowed to reside and flourish as commercial centers, thus [[Binondo]], a historical district of Manila, has become one of the world's oldest Chinatowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/388446/lifestyle/food/binondo-new-discoveries-in-the-world-s-oldest-chinatown|title=Binondo: New discoveries in the world's oldest Chinatown|last=See|first=Stanley Baldwin O.|date=17 November 2014|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their colonial mixed descendants, known as the [[Mestizos de Sangley]], would eventually form the bulk of the middle-class elite in Spanish colonial Philippines. The emergence of the [[Filipino mestizo|Mestizo class]] would later rise to the [[Principalía|noble Principalia class]], which later carried over and fueled the elite ruling classes of the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American era]] and later sovereign Philippines. Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.

[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community. Most of them in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]

In [[Myanmar]], the Chinese rarely intermarry (even amongst different Chinese linguistic groups), but have largely adopted the Burmese culture whilst maintaining Chinese cultural affinities. In [[Cambodia]], between 1965 and 1993, people with Chinese names were prevented from finding governmental employment, leading to a large number of people changing their names to a local, Cambodian name. Indonesia and Myanmar were among the countries that do not allow birth names to be registered in foreign languages, including Chinese. But since 2003, the Indonesian government has allowed ethnic Chinese people to use their Chinese name or using their Chinese family name on their birth certificate.

In Vietnam, all Chinese names can be pronounced by [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese readings]]. For example, the name of the previous [[paramount leader]] [[Hu Jintao|Hú Jǐntāo]] ({{lang|zh-cn|胡錦濤}}) would be spelled as &quot;Hồ Cẩm Đào&quot; in Vietnamese. There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people]] adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSO2009&quot; /&gt;

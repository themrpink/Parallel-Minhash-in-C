== Early life ==
Alfredo James Pacino was born in the [[East Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City on April 25, 1940. He is the son of Italian-American parents Rose Gerardi and Salvatore Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-al-pacino |title=Al Pacino Biography |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]] |location=UK |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429225729/http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-al-pacino |archivedate=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved with his mother to [[the Bronx]] to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who were Italian immigrants from [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Inside the Actors Studio]] |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] |airdate=October 2, 2006 |season=12 |number=20 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacino's father was from [[San Fratello]], Sicily, and moved to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur in [[Covina, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/25/al-pacino-this-much-i-know |title=Al Pacino: 'It's never been about money.

In his teenage years, Pacino was known as &quot;Sonny&quot; to his friends. He had ambitions to become a baseball player and was also nicknamed &quot;The Actor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; He attended [[Herman Ridder Junior High School (Public School 98)|Herman Ridder Junior High School]],&lt;ref name=landmark&gt;{{cite web |first=Betsy |last=Bradley |title=Herman Ridder Junior High School (Public School 98) |url=http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/90-HERMAN-RIDDER-J.H.S..pdf |publisher=Landmarks Preservation Commission |date=December 11, 1990 |page=10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204352/http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/90-HERMAN-RIDDER-J.H.S..pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |access-date=August 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon dropped out of most of his classes except for English. He subsequently attended the [[High School of Performing Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Okun, Stacey. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/14/nyregion/fire-destroys-former-performing-arts-high-school.html &quot;Fire Destroys Former Performing Arts High School,&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407092847/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/14/nyregion/fire-destroys-former-performing-arts-high-school.html |date=April 7, 2017 }} ''New York Times'' (February 14, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; after gaining admission by audition.
His mother disagreed with his decision and, after an argument, he left home. To finance his acting studies, Pacino took low-paying jobs as a messenger, busboy, janitor, and postal clerk,&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; as well as once working in the mailroom for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/al-pacino/trivia.html;jsessionid=2867EBF05815762FAEA7CAB6B0443F09 |title=Al Pacino Biography |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223901/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/al-pacino/trivia.html;jsessionid=2867EBF05815762FAEA7CAB6B0443F09 |archivedate=May 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacino began smoking and drinking at age nine, and used [[marijuana]] casually at age 13, but he abstained from [[Drug harmfulness|hard drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His two closest friends died from drug abuse at the ages of 19 and 30.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in the Bronx, Pacino got into occasional fights and was considered somewhat of a troublemaker at school.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground but was rejected as a teenager by the [[Actors Studio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; Pacino joined the [[HB Studio]], where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton,{{efn|Not to be confused with the British actor [[Charles Laughton]].}} who became his mentor and best friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;page&quot; /&gt; In this period, he was often unemployed and homeless, and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at friends' houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Pacino's mother died at the age of 43.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, his grandfather James also died.&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; Pacino recalled it as the lowest point of his life and said, &quot;I was 22 and the two most influential people in my life had gone, so that sent me into a tailspin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt;

After four years at HB Studio, Pacino successfully auditioned for the Actors Studio.&lt;ref name=page&gt;Grobel; p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; The Actors Studio is a membership organization of professional actors, [[theatre direction|theater directors]], and playwrights in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=official /&gt; Pacino studied &quot;[[method acting]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; under acting coach [[Lee Strasberg]], who appeared with Pacino in the films ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and in ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

During later interviews he spoke about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. &quot;The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves&amp;nbsp;... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview he added, &quot;It was exciting to work for him [Lee Strasberg] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before&amp;nbsp;... He had such a great understanding&amp;nbsp;... he loved actors so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipton&quot;&gt;Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Dutton (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Pacino was co-president, along with [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Harvey Keitel]], of the Actors Studio.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/20/theater/pacino-burstyn-and-keitel-to-lead-the-actors-studio.html |title=Pacino, Burstyn and Keitel To Lead the Actors Studio |publisher=The New York Times (June 20,2000) |access-date=September 30, 2020 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114145103/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/20/theater/pacino-burstyn-and-keitel-to-lead-the-actors-studio.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screen career ==
Pacino found acting enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; After his success on stage, Pacino made his film debut in 1969 with a brief appearance in ''[[Me, Natalie]]'', an independent film starring [[Patty Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt;

=== 1970s ===
His role as a heroin addict in ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'' (1971) brought Pacino to the attention of director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast him as [[Michael Corleone]] in what became a blockbuster [[Mafia]] film, ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Colaciello |title=Turn-offs that turn on |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19710819&amp;id=V8lHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6534,2997416 |newspaper=The Village Voice |date=August 19, 1971 |accessdate=October 21, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312084758/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19710819&amp;id=V8lHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6534,2997416 |archive-date = March 12, 2016 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], and the little-known [[Robert De Niro]] were tried out for the part, Coppola selected Pacino, to the dismay of studio executives who wanted someone better known.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Godfather' role still defines Pacino |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=19970418&amp;id=IvErAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6291,4152266 |newspaper=Kentucky New Era |date=April 18, 1997 |accessdate=October 21, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312084857/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=19970418&amp;id=IvErAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0mkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6291,4152266 |archive-date = March 12, 2016 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacino's performance earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style. This was described by ''[[Halliwell's Film Guide]]'' as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;tightly clenched&quot;. Pacino boycotted the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Award ceremony]], insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, as he noted that he had more screen time than co-star and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] winner [[Marlon Brando]]{{mdash}}who also boycotted the awards, but for unrelated reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot;&gt;Grobel; p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Pacino co-starred in ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'', with [[Gene Hackman]], and won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. That same year, Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in ''[[Serpico]]'', based on the true story of New York City policeman [[Frank Serpico]], who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot; /&gt; In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather Part II'', which was the first sequel to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]]; Pacino was nominated a third time for an Oscar, this second nomination for the Corleone role being in the lead category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxi&quot; /&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine has described his performance in ''The Godfather Part II'' as &quot;arguably cinema's greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', based on the true story of bank robber [[John Wojtowicz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; It was directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], who had directed him in ''Serpico'' a few years earlier, and Pacino was again nominated for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot;&gt;Grobel; p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in ''[[Bobby Deerfield]]'', directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], and received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]] for his portrayal of the title role. His next film was the courtroom drama ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]''. Pacino was lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot; /&gt; He lost out that year to [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''—a role that Pacino had declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grobel; p. xxiii&quot; /&gt;

During the 1970s, Pacino had four Oscar nominations for Best Actor, for his performances in ''Serpico'', ''The Godfather Part II'', ''Dog Day Afternoon'', and ''...And Justice for All''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, ''[[The Local Stigmatic]]'', a 1969 [[Off Broadway]] play by the English writer [[Heathcote Williams]]. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was not released theatrically, but was later released as part of the ''Pacino: An Actor's Vision'' box set in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

His 1985 film ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' about a fur trapper during the [[American Revolutionary War]], was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production,&lt;ref&gt;Grobel; p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of ''Crystal Clear'', ''National Anthems'' and other plays; he appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1988 in producer [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: &quot;I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'' on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning!

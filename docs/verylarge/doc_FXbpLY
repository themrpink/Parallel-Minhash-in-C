Hematopathology is the study of diseases of blood cells (including constituents such as [[white blood cells]], [[red blood cells]], and [[platelets]]) and the tissues, and organs comprising 
the hematopoietic system. The term hematopoietic system refers to tissues and organs that produce and/or primarily host hematopoietic cells and includes [[bone marrow]], the [[lymph nodes]], [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and other lymphoid tissues.  In the United States, hematopathology is a board certified subspecialty (licensed under the American Board of Pathology) practiced by those physicians who have completed a general pathology residency (anatomic, clinical, or combined) and an additional year of fellowship training in hematology. The hematopathologist reviews biopsies of lymph nodes, bone marrows and other tissues involved by an [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]] of cells of the hematopoietic system. In addition, the hematopathologist may be in charge of flow cytometric and/or molecular hematopathology studies.

===Molecular pathology===
{{Main|Molecular pathology}}

Molecular pathology is focused upon the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or [[bodily fluids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The molecular pathology of cancer|author=Harris TJ| author2=McCormick F. |date=2010|journal=Nat Rev Clin Oncol|volume=7|issue=5|pages=251–265|pmid=20351699|pmc=2222796|doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[proteomics]] and [[genetics]].  It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders.  The crossover between molecular pathology and [[epidemiology]] is represented by a related field &quot;[[molecular pathological epidemiology]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Chan AT, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2011 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal neoplasia: an emerging transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 397–411 | doi=10.1136/gut.2010.217182| pmid = 21036793 | pmc = 3040598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular pathology is commonly used in diagnosis of cancer and infectious diseases. Molecular Pathology is primarily used to detect cancers such as melanoma, brainstem glioma, brain tumors as well as many other types of cancer and infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Liwei |last2=Pan |first2=Chang-cun |last3=Li |first3=Deling |title=The historical change of brainstem glioma diagnosis and treatment: from imaging to molecular pathology and then molecular imaging |journal=Chinese Neurosurgical Journal |date=December 2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4 |doi=10.1186/s41016-015-0006-3|s2cid=29219804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques are numerous but include [[quantitative polymerase chain reaction]] (qPCR), [[multiplex polymerase chain reaction|multiplex PCR]], [[DNA microarray]], [[in situ hybridization]], [[DNA sequencing]], antibody-based [[immunofluorescence]] tissue assays, molecular profiling of pathogens, and analysis of bacterial genes for [[antimicrobial resistance]].&lt;ref name=Cai2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=H|author2=Caswell JL|author3=Prescott JF|title=Nonculture Molecular Techniques for Diagnosis of Bacterial Disease in Animals: A Diagnostic Laboratory Perspective|journal=Veterinary Pathology|date=March 2014|volume=51|issue=2|pages=341–350|doi=10.1177/0300985813511132|pmid=24569613|df=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques used are based on analyzing samples of DNA and RNA.

===Oral and maxillofacial pathology===
{{main|Oral and maxillofacial pathology}}
[[File:Geographic tongue (cropped).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Many conditions, such as this case of [[geographic tongue]], can be diagnosed partly on gross examination, but may be confirmed with tissue pathology.]]

Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology is one of nine dental specialties recognized by the [[American Dental Association]], and is sometimes considered a specialty of both dentistry and pathology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neville 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Neville BW|author2=Damm DD|author3=Allen CA|author4=Bouquot JE|name-list-style=amp|title=Oral &amp; maxillofacial pathology|date=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia?page=ix (preface)|isbn=978-0721690032|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Oral Pathologists must complete three years of post doctoral training in an accredited program and subsequently obtain diplomate status from the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. The specialty focuses on the diagnosis, clinical management and investigation of diseases that affect the oral cavity and surrounding maxillofacial structures including but not limited to [[odontogenic]], infectious, [[epithelial]], [[salivary gland]], [[bone]] and [[soft tissue]] pathologies.  It also significantly intersects with the field of [[dental pathology]].  Although concerned with a broad variety of diseases of the oral cavity, they have roles distinct from [[otorhinolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologists]] (&quot;ear, nose, and throat&quot; specialists), and [[Speech pathology|speech pathologists]], the latter of which helps diagnose many neurological or [[neuromuscular]] conditions relevant to [[Phonology|speech phonology]] or [[swallowing]].  Owing to the availability of the [[oral cavity]] to non-invasive examination, many conditions in the study of oral disease can be diagnosed, or at least suspected, from gross examination, but biopsies, cell smears, and other tissue analysis remain important diagnostic tools in oral pathology.

==Medical training and accreditation==
[[File:UNDmicroscope.jpg|thumb|An anatomical pathology instructor uses a microscope with multiple eyepieces to instruct students in diagnostic microscopy.]]

Becoming a pathologist generally requires [[medical specialty|specialty]]-training after [[medical school]], but individual nations vary some in the [[medical licensing]] required of pathologists.  In the United States, pathologists are physicians ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) who have completed a four-year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and three to four years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology [[medical residency|residency]]. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology: [[anatomical pathology]] and [[clinical Pathology]], each of which requires separate board certification. The [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]] also recognizes four primary specialties: anatomic pathology, dermatopathology, forensic pathology, and [[laboratory medicine]].  Pathologists may pursue specialised fellowship training within one or more subspecialties of either anatomical or clinical pathology. Some of these subspecialties permit additional board certification, while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171453/http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx |date=2007-06-30 }} of the American Board of Pathology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, pathologists are physicians licensed by the UK [[General Medical Council]]. The training to become a pathologist is under the oversight of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]]. After four to six years of undergraduate medical study, trainees proceed to a two-year foundation program. Full-time training in histopathology currently lasts between five and five and a half years and includes specialist training in surgical pathology, cytopathology, and autopsy pathology.  It is also possible to take a [[Royal College of Pathologists]] diploma in forensic pathology, dermatopathology, or cytopathology, recognising additional specialist training and expertise and to get specialist accreditation in forensic pathology, [[pediatric pathology]], and neuropathology.  All postgraduate medical training and education in the UK is overseen by the General Medical Council.

In France, pathology is separated into two distinct specialties, anatomical pathology, and clinical pathology. Residencies for both lasts four years. Residency in anatomical pathology is open to physicians only, while clinical pathology is open to both physicians and [[pharmacist]]s. At the end of the second year of clinical pathology residency, residents can choose between general clinical pathology and a specialization in one of the disciplines, but they can not practice anatomical pathology, nor can anatomical pathology residents practice clinical pathology.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulletin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sante.gouv.fr/adm/dagpb/bo/2003/03-05/a0050272.htm ''Reglementation'' for French Residency in Clinical Pathology (Biologie médicale)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228225540/http://www.sante.gouv.fr/adm/dagpb/bo/2003/03-05/a0050272.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with other diagnostic medicine==
{{Main|Diagnostic medicine|Oncology|Infectious disease|Medical imaging}}

Though separate fields in terms of medical practice, a number of areas of inquiry in medicine and
medical science either overlap greatly with general pathology, work in tandem with it, or contribute significantly to the understanding of the pathology of a given disease or its course in an individual.  As a significant portion of all general pathology practice is concerned with [[cancer]], the practice of [[oncology]] makes extensive use of both anatomical and clinical pathology in diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cancer.Net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Oncologists|url=http://www.cancer.net/all-about-cancer/newly-diagnosed/find-oncologist/types-oncologists|publisher=Cancer.Net : American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)|accessdate=25 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601155338/http://www.cancer.net/all-about-cancer/newly-diagnosed/find-oncologist/types-oncologists|archivedate=1 June 2013|date=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, biopsy, [[segmental resection|resection]], and blood tests are all examples of pathology work that is essential for the diagnoses of many kinds of cancer and for the [[cancer staging|staging]] of [[Cancerous tumor|cancerous masses]]. In a similar fashion, the tissue and blood analysis techniques of general pathology are of central significance to the investigation of serious [[infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious disease]] and as such inform significantly upon the fields of [[epidemiology]], [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]], [[immunology]], and [[parasitology]]. General pathology methods are of great importance to biomedical research into disease, wherein they are sometimes referred to as [[experimental pathology|&quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;investigative&quot; pathology]].

[[Medical imaging]] is the generating of visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of [[internal medicine|internal]] physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma.  Medical imaging is also central in supplying the [[biometric]] data necessary to establish baseline features of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected.  These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases.  Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include [[radiology]] (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray [[radiography]]) [[magnetic resonance imaging]],  [[medical ultrasonography]] (or ultrasound), [[endoscopy]], [[elastography]], [[tactile imaging]], [[thermography]], [[medical photography]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[functional imaging]] techniques such as [[positron emission tomography]].  Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving [[electroencephalography]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and [[electrocardiography]] often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.

==Psychopathology==
{{Main|Psychopathology}}

Psychopathology is the study of [[mental illness]], particularly of severe disorders.  Informed heavily by both [[psychology]] and [[neurology]], its purpose is to classify mental illness, elucidate its underlying causes, and guide clinical [[psychiatric]] treatment accordingly.  Although diagnosis and classification of mental norms and disorders is largely the purview of psychiatry—the results of which are guidelines such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], which attempt to classify mental disease mostly on behavioural evidence, though not without controversy&lt;ref name=frana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1688399 |title=The New Crisis in Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis |author=Allen Frances |author-link=Allen Frances |date=17 May 2013 |work=Annals of Internal Medicine |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607183245/http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1688399 |archivedate=7 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;concept&amp;evolution&quot;&gt;Dalal PK, Sivakumar T.

Mental or social disorders or behaviours seen as generally unhealthy or excessive in a given individual, to the point where they cause harm or severe disruption to the sufferer's lifestyle, are often called &quot;pathological&quot; (e.g., [[pathological gambling]] or [[pathological liar]]).

==Non-humans==
[[File:Enzootic pneumonia ewe.jpg|thumb|185px|This field [[post-mortem]] of a [[Sheep|ewe]] has revealed [[lesions]] consistent with acute [[haemolytic]] [[pneumonia]], possibly due to ''Pasteurella haemolytica''.]]
Although the vast majority of lab work and research in pathology concerns the development of disease in humans, pathology is of significance throughout the biological sciences. Two main catch-all fields exist to represent most complex organisms capable of serving as host to a pathogen or other form of disease: veterinary pathology (concerned with all non-human species of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[Animalia]]) and [[phytopathology]], which studies disease in plants.

===Veterinary pathology===
{{Main|Veterinary pathology|Animal testing}}

Veterinary pathology covers a vast array of species, but with a significantly smaller number of practitioners, so understanding of disease in non-human animals, especially as regards [[veterinarian|veterinary practice]],  varies considerably by species.  Nonetheless, significant amounts of pathology research are conducted on animals, for two primary reasons: 1) The origins of diseases are typically [[zoonotic]] in nature, and many infectious pathogens have animal vectors and, as such, understanding the mechanisms of action for these pathogens in non-human hosts is essential to the understanding and application of [[epidemiology]] and 2) those animals that share physiological and genetic traits with humans can be used as surrogates for the study of the disease and potential treatments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acvp.org/public/WhatIsVetPath.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024125740/http://www.acvp.org/public/WhatIsVetPath.cfm |archivedate=October 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the effects of various synthetic products. For this reason, as well as their roles as [[livestock]] and [[companion animals]], [[mammals]] generally have the largest body of research in veterinary pathology. Animal testing remains a controversial practice, even in cases where it is used to research treatment for human disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rollin |first1=Bernard E. |title=The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=27 |pages=285–304 |date=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | pmid=16937023 |issue=4|s2cid=18620094 |url=https://org.uib.no/dyreavd/handouts/Rollin__B._2006._Animal_Research_Regulation_in_Theoret._Medicin_....PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in human medical pathology, the practice of veterinary pathology is customarily divided into the two main fields of anatomical and clinical pathology.

[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|195px|A [[tobacco plant]] infected with the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]]]

===Plant pathology===
{{Main|Plant pathology}}

Although the pathogens and their mechanics differ greatly from those of animals, plants are subject to a wide variety of diseases, including those caused by [[fungi]], [[oomycete]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, virus-like organisms, [[phytoplasma]]s, [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s.  Damage caused by [[insects]], [[mite]]s, [[vertebrate]], and other small herbivores is not considered a part of the domain of plant pathology. The field is connected to [[plant disease epidemiology]] and especially concerned with the [[horticulture]] of species that are of high importance to the [[human diet]] or other human utility.

In [[gamma-ray astronomy]], '''gamma-ray bursts''' ('''GRBs''') are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

F. |last2=Fruchter |first2=A. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial flash of [[gamma ray]]s, a longer-lived &quot;afterglow&quot; is usually emitted at longer wavelengths ([[X-ray]], [[ultraviolet]], [[visible spectrum|optical]], [[infrared]], [[microwave]] and [[radio waves|radio]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne &amp; Atteia 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a [[supernova]] or [[superluminous supernova]] as a high-mass [[star]] implodes to form a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]].

A subclass of GRBs (the &quot;short&quot; bursts) appear to originate from the merger of [[binary star|binary]] [[neutron stars]]. The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Resonant Shattering of Neutron Star Crust |last1=Tsang |first1=David |last2=Read |first2=Jocelyn S.|author2-link= Jocelyn Read |last3=Hinderer |first3=Tanja |last4=Piro |first4=Anthony L. |last5=Bondarescu |first5=Ruxandra |date=2012 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=108 |page=5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.011102|arxiv = 1110.0467 |bibcode = 2012PhRvL.108a1102T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of most GRBs are billions of [[light year]]s away from [[Earth]], implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the [[Sun]] will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Massive star's dying blast caught by rapid-response telescopes |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-07-massive-star-dying-blast-caught.html |date=26 July 2017 |work=PhysOrg |accessdate=27 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years&lt;ref name=&quot;rates&quot;&gt;[[#Podsiadlowski|Podsiadlowski 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the [[Milky Way galaxy]], although a related class of phenomena, [[soft gamma repeater]] flares, are associated with [[magnetar]]s within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a [[mass extinction]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melott2004&quot;&gt;[[#Melott|Melott 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]], which had been designed to detect [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|covert nuclear weapons tests]]; this was declassified and published in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;KSO&quot; /&gt; Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between [[comet]]s and [[neutron star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#HurleyBib|Hurley 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their [[redshift]]s using optical [[spectroscopy]], and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and [[supernova]]e associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and [[luminosity]] of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.

[[File:BATSE 2704.jpg|thumb|Positions on the sky of all gamma-ray bursts detected during the BATSE mission. The distribution is [[isotropic]], with no concentration towards the plane of the Milky Way, which runs horizontally through the center of the image.]]
Gamma-ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the U.S. [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The [[United States]] suspected that the [[Soviet Union]] might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 [[UTC]], the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature.&lt;ref name=&quot;FlashVela&quot; /&gt; Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], led by [[Ray Klebesadel]], filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the [[Star position|sky positions]] of sixteen bursts&lt;ref name=&quot;FlashVela&quot;&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;KSO&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1973ApJ...182L..85K |title=Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin |author1=Klebesadel R.W. |author2=Strong I.B. |author3=Olson R.A. |date=1973 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=182 |page=L85 |doi=10.1086/181225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early theories of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. From 1991, the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer ([[CGRO#Instruments|BATSE]]) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data that showed the distribution of GRBs is [[Isotropy|isotropic]]{{snd}}not biased towards any particular direction in space.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meegan|Meegan 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated in or near the galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vedrenne p. 16–40&quot;&gt;[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne &amp; Atteia 2009]], pp. 16–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pac95|Paczyński 1999]], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Piran92&quot;&gt;[[#Piran92|Piran 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vedrenne p. 16–40&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamb&quot;&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B and [[GW170817]], a [[gravitational wave]] event detected in 2017, may have been produced by the same mechanism – the [[Neutron star merger|merger]] of two [[neutron star]]s. The similarities between the two events, in terms of [[gamma ray]], [[optical]] and [[x-ray]] emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host [[Galaxy|galaxies]], are &quot;striking&quot;, suggesting the two separate events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a [[kilonova]], which may be more common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA-20181016&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |author=University of Maryland |title=All in the family: Kin of gravitational wave source discovered – New observations suggest that kilonovae – immense cosmic explosions that produce silver, gold and platinum – may be more common than thought|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/uom-ait101518.php |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 |author-link=University of Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NC-20181016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Troja, E.|display-authors=etal |title=A luminous blue kilonova and an off-axis jet from a compact binary merger at z = 0.1341 |date=16 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |pages=4089 |number=4089 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06558-7 |pmid=30327476 |pmc=6191439 |arxiv=1806.10624 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9.4089T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20181016&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mohon |first=Lee |title=GRB 150101B: A Distant Cousin to GW170817 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/grb-150101b-a-distant-cousin-to-gw170817.html |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPC-20181017&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Powerful Cosmic Flash Is Likely Another Neutron-Star Merger |url=https://www.space.com/42158-another-neutron-star-crash-detected.html |date=17 October 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2019, astronomers reported a notable [[gamma ray burst]] explosion, named [[GRB 190114C]], initially detected in January 2019, which, so far, produced gamma-rays with the highest energy – about [[Electronvolt|1 Tera electron volts (Tev)]] – ever observed for such a cosmic event.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA-20191120&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |author=ESA/Hubble Information Centre |title=Hubble studies gamma-ray burst with the highest energy ever seen |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/eic-hsg112019.php |date=20 November 2019 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=20 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20191120&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veres, P |s2cid=208191199 |display-authors=et al. |title=Observation of inverse Compton emission from a long γ-ray burst |date=20 November 2019 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=575 |issue=7783 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1754-6 |pmid=31748725 |arxiv=2006.07251 |bibcode=2019Natur.575..459M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counterpart objects as candidate sources ===
For decades after the discovery of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including [[white dwarf]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova]]e, [[globular cluster]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[Seyfert galaxies]], and [[BL Lac object]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;spatial&quot;&gt;[[#HurleyConf|Hurley 1986]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; All such searches were unsuccessful,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;790305b&quot;&gt;A notable exception is the [[GRB 790305b|5 March event]] of 1979, an extremely bright burst that was successfully localized to supernova remnant [[LMC N49|N49]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. This event is now interpreted as a [[magnetar]] [[Gamma-ray burst progenitors#Magnetar giant flares|giant flare]], more related to [[soft gamma repeater|SGR]] flares than &quot;true&quot; gamma-ray bursts.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a few cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pedersen|Pedersen 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hurley92|Hurley 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFishman&quot; /&gt;

=== Afterglow ===
[[File:BeppoSAX.jpg|thumb|The Italian–Dutch satellite [[BeppoSAX]], launched in April 1996, provided the first accurate positions of gamma-ray bursts, allowing follow-up observations and identification of the sources.]]
Several models for the origin of gamma-ray bursts postulated that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst [[ejecta]] and interstellar gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pac93|Paczynski 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; This fading emission would be called the &quot;afterglow&quot;. Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely because it is difficult to observe a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite [[BeppoSAX]] detected a gamma-ray burst ([[GRB 970228]]&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;grbnames&quot;&gt;GRBs are named after the date on which they are discovered: the first two digits being the year, followed by the two-digit month and two-digit day and a letter with the order they were detected during that day. The letter 'A' is appended to the name for the first burst identified, 'B' for the second, and so on. For bursts before the year 2010 this letter was only appended if more than one burst occurred that day.&lt;/ref&gt; and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission. The [[William Herschel Telescope]] identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paradijs|van Paradijs 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vedrenne p. 90&quot;&gt;[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne &amp; Atteia 2009]], pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the very faint luminosity of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well after then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, [[GRB 970508]]. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The [[absorption spectrum|spectrum]] of the object revealed a [[redshift]] of ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.835, placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reichart|Reichart 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vedrenne p. 90&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], pp. 118–123&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, [[GRB 980425]] was followed within a day by a bright supernova ([[SN 1998bw]]), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue about the nature of the systems that produce GRBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;98bw&quot;&gt;[[#Galama|Galama 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swift spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift Spacecraft]] launched in November 2004]]
BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|CGRO]] (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the revolution in the study of gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, [[High Energy Transient Explorer|HETE-2]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#HETE|Ricker 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]], was launched in 2004 and as of 2018 is still operational.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NASA2008|McCray 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gehrels04|Gehrels 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically [[Slew (spacecraft)|slewed]] to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]] mission was launched carrying the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor|Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor]], which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's [[Fermi LAT|Large Area Telescope]]. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the [[Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network]]. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ROTSE|Akerlof 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Akerlof99|Akerlof 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

New developments since the 2000s include the recognition of short gamma-ray bursts as a separate class (likely from merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae), the discovery of extended, erratic flaring activity at X-ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs, and the discovery of the most luminous ([[GRB 080319B]]) and the former most distant ([[GRB 090423]]) objects in the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;&gt;[[#Bloom|Bloom 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#090423|Reddy 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; The most distant known GRB, [[GRB 090429B]], is now the most distant known object in the universe.

== Classification ==
[[File:GRB BATSE 12lightcurves.png|thumb|Gamma-ray burst light curves]]
The [[light curve]]s of gamma-ray bursts are extremely diverse and complex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Katz|Katz 2002]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; No two gamma-ray burst light curves are identical,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marani|Marani 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; with large variation observed in almost every property: the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes, there can be a single peak or several individual subpulses, and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading. Some bursts are preceded by a &quot;[[Gamma-ray burst precursor|precursor]]&quot; event, a weak burst that is then followed (after seconds to minutes of no emission at all) by the much more intense &quot;true&quot; bursting episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazzati&quot;&gt;[[#Lazzati|Lazatti 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; The light curves of some events have extremely chaotic and complicated profiles with almost no discernible patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFishman&quot;&gt;[[#CFishman|Fishman &amp; Meegan 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some light curves can be roughly reproduced using certain simplified models,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simic|Simić 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; little progress has been made in understanding the full diversity observed. Many classification schemes have been proposed, but these are often based solely on differences in the appearance of light curves and may not always reflect a true physical difference in the progenitors of the explosions. However, plots of the distribution of the observed duration&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;T90&quot;&gt;The duration of a burst is typically measured by T90, the duration of the period which 90 percent of the burst's [[energy]] is emitted. Recently some otherwise &quot;short&quot; GRBs have been shown to be followed by a second, much longer emission episode that when included in the burst light curve results in T90 durations of up to several minutes: these events are only short in the literal sense when this component is excluded.&lt;/ref&gt; for a large number of gamma-ray bursts show a clear [[bimodal distribution|bimodality]], suggesting the existence of two separate populations: a &quot;short&quot; population with an average duration of about 0.3 seconds and a &quot;long&quot; population with an average duration of about 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kouveliotou&quot;&gt;[[#Kouveliotou|Kouveliotou 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt; Both distributions are very broad with a significant overlap region in which the identity of a given event is not clear from duration alone. Additional classes beyond this two-tiered system have been proposed on both observational and theoretical grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horvath98&quot;&gt;[[#Horvath98|Horvath 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hakkila&quot;&gt;[[#Hakkila|Hakkila 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chattopadhyay&quot;&gt;[[#Chattopadhyay|Chattopadhyay 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgili&quot;&gt;[[#Virgili|Virgili 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short gamma-ray bursts ===
[[File:Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] captures infrared glow of a [[kilonova]] blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1329a/|work=Image Gallery|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Events with a duration of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/short_burst_oct5.html In a Flash NASA Helps Solve 35-year-old Cosmic Mystery]. NASA (2005-10-05) The 30% figure is given here, as well as afterglow discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] and the central regions of large [[galaxy cluster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bloom06|Bloom 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hjorth|Hjorth 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berger07|Berger 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gehrels05|Gehrels 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;[[#Zhang09|Zhang 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The true nature of these objects was initially unknown, and the leading hypothesis was that they originated from the mergers of binary neutron stars&lt;ref name=&quot;Nakar 2007&quot;&gt;[[#Nakar07|Nakar 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; or a neutron star with a [[black hole]]. Such mergers were theorized to produce [[kilonova]]e,&lt;ref name=Metzger2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzger, B.

The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole in less than two seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer [[neutronium]]) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, over a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt; A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from [[soft gamma repeaters]] in nearby galaxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederiks&quot;&gt;[[#Frederiks|Frederiks 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hurley05|Hurley 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of short GRBs in kilonovae was confirmed when short [[GRB 170817A]] was detected only 1.7 s after the detection of gravitational wave [[GW170817]], which was a signal from the merger of two neutron stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysRev&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=B.

=== Long gamma-ray bursts ===
Most observed events (70%) have a duration of greater than two seconds and are classified as long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute the majority of the population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a [[core-collapse supernova]] as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woosley06&quot;&gt;[[#Woosley06|Woosley &amp; Bloom 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pontzen&quot;&gt;[[#Pontzen|Pontzen et al. 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts ===
These events are at the tail end of the long GRB duration distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse of a [[blue supergiant star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2013ApJ...766...30G |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/766/1/30 |title=The Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst 111209A: The Collapse of a Blue Supergiant? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=766 |issue=1 |page=30 |date=2013 |last1=Gendre |first1=B. |last2=Stratta |first2=G. |last3=Atteia |first3=J.

== Energetics and beaming ==
[[File:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's illustration of a bright gamma-ray burst occurring in a star-forming region. Energy from the explosion is beamed into two narrow, oppositely directed jets.]]
Gamma-ray bursts are very bright as observed from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a [[bolometric magnitude|bolometric]] flux comparable to a bright star of our galaxy despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. [[GRB 080319B]], for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a [[visible magnitude]] of 5.8,&lt;ref name=&quot;Racusin&quot;&gt;[[#Racusin08|Racusin 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to that of the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5&amp;nbsp;billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|rest-mass energy]] of the [[Sun]] (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot; /&gt;

Gamma-ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions, with most of the explosion energy [[collimated light|collimated]] into a narrow [[relativistic jet|jet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rykoff|Rykoff 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abdo|Abdo 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate angular width of the jet (that is, the degree of spread of the beam) can be estimated directly by observing the achromatic &quot;jet breaks&quot; in afterglow light curves: a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows and can no longer [[relativistic beaming|beam]] its radiation as effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sari99&quot;&gt;[[#Sari99|Sari 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Burrows|Burrows 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frail&quot;&gt;[[#Frail|Frail 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because their energy is strongly focused, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts are expected to miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically. When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J, or about 1/2000 of a [[Solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) energy equivalent&lt;ref name=&quot;Frail&quot; /&gt;{{snd}}which is still many times the mass-energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J). This is comparable to the energy released in a bright [[Type Ib supernova|type Ib/c]] [[supernova]] and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;98bw&quot; /&gt; Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|type Ic supernova]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mazzali|Mazzali 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frail2000|Frail 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

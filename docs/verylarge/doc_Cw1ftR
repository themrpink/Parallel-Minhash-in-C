''Two'' rooks on the seventh rank are often enough to force victory, or at least a draw by [[perpetual check]].&lt;ref&gt;The two rooks are sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;pigs on the seventh&quot;, because they often threaten to &quot;eat&quot; the opponent's pieces or pawns.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endgame===
Rooks are most powerful towards the end of a game (i.e., the [[chess endgame|endgame]]), when they can move unobstructed by pawns and control large numbers of squares. They are somewhat clumsy at restraining enemy pawns from advancing towards promotion, unless they can occupy the file behind the advancing pawn. As well, a rook best supports a friendly pawn towards promotion from behind it on the same file (see [[Tarrasch rule]]).

In a position with a rook and one or two [[minor piece]]s versus two rooks, generally in addition to pawns, and possibly other pieces&amp;nbsp;– [[Lev Alburt]] advises that the player with the single rook should avoid exchanging the rook for one of his opponent's rooks {{harvcol|Alburt|2009|p=44}}.

The rook is a very powerful piece to deliver [[checkmate]]. Below are a few examples of rook checkmates that are easy to force.

==History==

{{further information|History of chess}}
[[File:Grose-Francis-Pavisors-and-Moveable-Tower-Assaulting-Castle-1812.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a [[siege tower]], which the rook may be intended to represent]]
In the medieval [[shatranj]], the rook symbolized a '''[[chariot]]'''. The [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''rukh'' means &quot;chariot&quot;{{harvcol|Davidson|1949|p=10}}, and the corresponding piece in the original Indian version, [[chaturanga]], has the name ''ratha'' (meaning &quot;chariot&quot;). In modern times it is mostly known as हाथी ([[elephant]]) to [[hindi (language)|Hindi]]-speaking players, while east-Asian chess games such as [[xiangqi]] and [[shogi]] have names also meaning chariot (車) for the same piece.&lt;ref&gt;現代漢語詞典 {{ISBN|978-962-07-0211-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian war-chariots were heavily armored, carrying a driver and at least one ranged-weapon bearer, such as an archer. The sides of the chariot were built to resemble fortified stone work, giving the impression of small, mobile buildings, causing terror on the battlefield.

In Europe the castle or tower appears for the first time in the 16th century in [[Marco Girolamo Vida | Vida]]'s 1550 ''Ludus Scacchia'', and then as a tower on the back of an elephant. In time, the elephant disappeared and only the tower was used as the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Article by Dr. Hans Holländer, &quot;CYCLOPES, ELEPHANTS AND CHESS ROOKS&quot; |url= http://www.chess-museum.com/cyclopes-elephants-and-chess-rooks-by-hans-hollaumlnder.html |accessdate= 26 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the rook is almost universally represented as a [[crenellation |crenellated]] [[turret]]. The piece is called ''torre'' (&quot;tower&quot;) in Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; ''tour'' in French; ''toren'' in Dutch; ''Turm'' in German; ''torn'' in Swedish; and ''torni'' in Finnish. In Hungarian it is ''bástya'' (&quot;[[bastion]]&quot;) and in [[Hebrew language]] it is called ''צריח'' (pronounced &quot;Tzariach&quot;, meaning &quot;fortified tower&quot;). In the [[British Museum]]'s collection of the medieval [[Lewis chessmen |Lewis chess pieces]] the rooks appear as stern warders, or wild-eyed [[Berserker]] warriors.

Rooks usually are similar in appearance to small castles, and as a result a rook is sometimes called a &quot;'''castle'''&quot; {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1996}}.
Modern chess literature rarely, if ever, uses this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horton|1959|p= 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages the rook is called a '''ship''': Thai เรือ (''reūa''), [[Armenian language |Armenian]] Նավակ (''navak''), Russian ладья (''ladya''), [[Javanese language| Javanese]] ꦥꦫꦄꦲꦸ (''prahu''). This may be because of the use of an Arabic style V-shaped rook piece, which some may have mistaken for a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MpooAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8C%D1%8F+|title= Studia Etymologica Cracoviensia|first= Marek|last= Stachowski|date= January 4, 2002|publisher= Ksie̦garnia Akademicka|via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.siamsport.co.th/column/detail/68913|title= ม้า...เสน่ห์หมากรุก|date= January 14, 2018|website= www.siamsport.co.th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://chessschool.am/lesson/15|title= Շախմատային նավակ|first= AIST|last= Global|website= chessschool.am}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Davidson|first= Henry A.|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PQBpr6KAdHkC&amp;q=javanese+word+for+chariot&amp;pg=PT66|title= A Short History of Chess|date= 2012-10-10|publisher= Crown|isbn= 978-0-307-82829-3|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the rendition comes from Sanskrit ''roka'' (ship); however, no ''chaturanga'' pieces were ever called a ''roka''. Murray argued that the [[Javanese people| Javanese]] could not visualize a chariot moving through the jungles in sweeping fashion as the rook. The only vehicle that moved in straight fashion was ship, thus they replaced it with [[Proa| prahu]]. Murray, however, did not give an explanation of why the Russians call the piece a &quot;ship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In Bulgarian, it is called the '''cannon''' (Топ, Romanised ''top'').

In [[Kannada language |Kannada]], it is known as ಆನೆ (''āāne''), meaning &quot;'''elephant'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.english-kannada.com/|title= English :: Kannada Online Dictionary|website=English :: Kannada Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual, as the term for &quot;elephant&quot; is in many other languages applied to the [[bishop (chess)| bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|title= How the Elephant became a Bishop: An Enquiry into the Origin of the Names of Chess Pieces|first= Howard|last= Candler|date= January 1, 1907|journal= Archaeological Journal|volume= 64|issue= 1|pages= 80–90|doi= 10.1080/00665983.1907.10853048 |url = https://zenodo.org/record/2238958}}

==Heraldry==
[[Image:Arms of the Rookwood family of Stanningfield.png|right|thumb|200px|Arms of the English family of Rookwood, featuring chess rooks as a [[canting arms|cant]] on the name]] Chess rooks frequently occur as heraldic [[charge (heraldry)|charges]]. Heraldic rooks are usually shown as they looked in medieval chess-sets, with the usual battlements replaced by two outward-curving horns. They occur in arms from around the 13th&amp;nbsp;century onwards.

In [[Canadian heraldry]], the chess rook is the [[cadency]] mark of a fifth daughter.

The '''bishop''' (♗,♝) is a [[Chess piece|piece]] in the game of [[chess]]. Each player begins the game with two bishops. One starts between the {{chessgloss|king's knight}} and the [[King (chess)|king]], the other between the {{chessgloss|queen's knight}} and the [[Queen (chess)|queen]]. The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.
{{AN chess|pos=toc}}

==Placement and movement==
The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to [[diagonal]] movement. Bishops, like all other pieces except the [[Knight (chess)|knight]], cannot jump over other pieces. A bishop captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.

The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin on, i.e. the ''king's bishop'' and ''queen's bishop''. As a consequence of its diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or black squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as ''light-squared'' or ''dark-squared'' bishops.

==Comparison to other pieces==

===Versus rook===
A [[rook (chess)|rook]] is generally worth about two [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] more than a bishop (see [[Chess piece relative value]] and [[the exchange (chess)|the exchange]]). The bishop has access to only half of the squares on the board, whereas all squares of the board are accessible to the [[Rook (chess)|rook]]. On an empty board, a rook always attacks fourteen squares, whereas a bishop attacks no more than thirteen and sometimes as few as seven, depending on how near it is to the center. Also, a king and rook can force [[checkmate]] against a lone king, while a king and bishop cannot.

===Versus knight===
In general bishops are approximately equal in strength to knights, but depending on the game situation either may have a distinct advantage.

Less experienced players tend to underrate the bishop compared to the knight because the knight can reach all squares and is more adept at [[fork (chess)|forking]]. More experienced players understand the power of the bishop {{harvcol|Mednis|1990|p=2}}.

Bishops usually gain in relative strength towards the [[Chess endgame|endgame]] as more pieces are captured and more open lines become available on which they can operate. A bishop can easily influence both wings simultaneously, whereas a knight is less capable of doing so. In an open endgame, a pair of bishops is decidedly superior to either a bishop and a knight, or two knights. A player possessing a pair of bishops has a strategic weapon in the form of a long-term threat to trade down to an advantageous endgame.

Two bishops and king [[Two bishops checkmate|can force checkmate]] against a lone king, whereas [[two knights endgame|two knights]] cannot. A bishop and knight [[bishop and knight checkmate|can force mate]], but with far greater difficulty than two bishops.

In certain positions a bishop can by itself lose a move (see [[Triangulation (chess)|triangulation]] and [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]]), while a knight can never do so. The bishop is capable of [[Skewer (chess)|skewering]] or [[Pin (chess)|pinning]] a piece, while the knight can do neither. A bishop can in some situations hinder a knight from moving. In these situations, the bishop is said to be &quot;dominating&quot; the knight.

On the other hand, in the [[chess opening|opening]] and [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]] a bishop may be hemmed in by pawns of both players, and thus be inferior to a knight which can jump over them. A knight [[Check (chess)|check]] cannot be [[Block (chess)|blocked]] but a bishop check can. Furthermore, on a crowded board a knight has many tactical opportunities to [[Fork (chess)|fork]] two enemy pieces. A bishop can fork, but opportunities are more rare. One such example occurs in the position illustrated, which arises from the [[Ruy Lopez]]: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Be7{{chesspunc|?!}} 7.d4 d6 8.c3 Bg4 9.h3{{chesspunc|!?}} Bxf3 10.Qxf3 exd4 11.Qg3 g6 12.Bh6{{chesspunc|!}}

In the middlegame, a player with only one bishop should generally place friendly pawns on squares of the color that the bishop cannot move to. This allows the player to control squares of both colors, allows the bishop to move freely among the pawns, and helps fix enemy pawns on squares on which they can be attacked by the bishop. Such a bishop is often referred to as a &quot;good&quot; bishop.

Conversely, a bishop which is impeded by friendly pawns is often referred to as a &quot;bad bishop&quot; (or sometimes, disparagingly, a &quot;tall pawn&quot;). The black light-squared bishop in the French Defense is a notorious example of this concept. However, a &quot;bad&quot; bishop need not always be a weakness, especially if it is outside its own [[pawn chain]]s. In addition, having a &quot;bad&quot; bishop may be advantageous in an [[opposite-colored bishops endgame]]. Even if the bad bishop is passively placed, it may serve a useful defensive function; a well-known quip from GM [[Mihai Suba]] is that &quot;Bad bishops protect good pawns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Discussions on the strength of bishops is covered e.g. in &quot;The Art of Planning, part 2&quot; by [[Jeremy Silman]] published in the July 1990 issue of ''[[Chess Life]]''. Suba's quote is mentioned e.g. in ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, Advances Since Nimzowitsch'' by [[John L. Watson|John Watson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the position from the game Krasenkow versus Zvjaginsev,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1292300 |title=Krasenkow vs. Zvjaginsev |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a thicket of black pawns hems in Black's bishop on c8, so Black is effectively playing with one piece fewer than White. Although the black pawns also obstruct the white bishop on e2, it has many more attacking possibilities, and thus is a good bishop vis-à-vis Black's bad bishop. Black resigned after another ten moves.

===Fianchetto===
{{main|Fianchetto}}
A bishop may be ''[[fianchetto]]ed'', for example after moving the g2 pawn to g3 and the bishop on f1 to g2. This can form a strong defense for the [[Castling|castled]] king on g1 and the bishop can often exert strong pressure on the long diagonal (here h1–a8). A fianchettoed bishop should generally not be given up lightly, since the resulting {{chessgloss|holes}} in the pawn formation may prove to be serious weaknesses, particularly if the king has castled on that side of the board.

There are nonetheless some modern opening lines where a fianchettoed bishop is given up for a knight in order to double the opponent's pawns, for example 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 Bxc3+!? 5.bxc3 f5, a sharp line originated by [[Roman Dzindzichashvili]]. Giving up a fianchettoed queen's bishop for a knight is usually less problematic. For example, in [[Anatoly Karpov|Karpov]]&amp;ndash;[[Walter Browne|Browne]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] 1972, after 1.c4 c5 2.b3 Nf6 3.Bb2 g6?!, Karpov gave up his fianchettoed bishop with 4.Bxf6! exf6 5.Nc3, doubling Black's pawns and giving him a hole on d5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1035250 |title=Anatoly Karpov vs. Walter Shawn Browne, 1972 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endgame===
An [[Chess endgame|endgame]] in which each player has only one bishop, one controlling the dark squares and the other the light, will often result in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] even if one player has a pawn or sometimes two more than the other. The players tend to gain control of squares of opposite colors, and a deadlock results. In endgames with same-colored bishops, however, even a positional advantage may be enough to win {{harvcol|Mednis|1990|pp=133–34}}.

Endgames in which each player has only one bishop (and no other pieces besides the king) and the bishops are on opposite colors are often [[draw (chess)|drawn]], even when one side has an extra pawn or two. Many of these positions would be a win if the bishops were on the same color.

The position from Wolf versus Leonhardt (see diagram), shows an important defensive setup. Black can make no progress, since the white bishop ties the black king to defending the pawn on g4 and it also prevents the advance ...f3+ because it would simply {{chessgloss|capture}} the pawn&amp;nbsp;– then either the other pawn is exchanged for the bishop (an immediate draw) or the pawn advances (an easily drawn position). Otherwise the bishop alternates between the squares d1 and e2 {{Harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|p=118}}.

If two pawns are [[Connected pawns|connected]], they normally win if they reach their sixth {{chessgloss|rank}}, otherwise the game may be a draw (as above). If two pawns are separated by one {{chessgloss|file}} they usually draw, but win if they are farther apart {{Harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|pp=184–204}}.

In some cases with more pawns on the board, it is actually advantageous to have the bishops on opposite colors if one side has weak pawns. In the 1925 game of [[Efim Bogoljubov]] versus [[Max Blümich]], (see diagram) White wins because of the bishops being on opposite colors making Black weak on the black squares, the weakness of Black's [[isolated pawn]]s on the {{chessgloss|queenside}}, and the weak [[doubled pawns]] on the {{chessgloss|kingside}} {{Harvcol|Reinfeld|1947|pp=80–81}}.

====Wrong bishop====
{{Main|Wrong bishop|Wrong rook pawn}}
In an [[chess endgame|endgame]] with a bishop, in some cases the bishop is the &quot;[[wrong bishop]]&quot;, meaning that it is on the wrong color of square for some purpose (usually [[promotion (chess)|promoting]] a pawn). For example, with just a bishop and a [[rook pawn]], if the bishop cannot control the promotion square of the pawn, it is said to be the &quot;wrong bishop&quot; or the pawn is said to be the [[wrong rook pawn]]. This results in some positions being [[draw (chess)|drawn]] (by setting up a [[fortress (chess)|fortress]]) which otherwise would be won.

The [[neolithic]] site of [['Ain Ghazal]] was found in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC, it had an area of {{convert|15|ha|abbr=off|sp=us}} and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time the site was a typical [[aceramic]] [[Neolithic]] village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Settlements of the Middle East|url=http://docslide.us/documents/prehistoric-settlements-of-the-middle-east.html|accessdate=2015-09-22|work=bhavika1990|date=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area.

In the 13th century BC Amman was the capital of the [[Ammon]]ites, and became known as &quot;Rabbath Ammon&quot;. Ammon provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made Ammon a vital location along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Anatolia]].

Excavations by archaeologists near [[Amman Civil Airport]] uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a [[pyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.biblestudywithrandy.com/2014/08/temple-human-sacrifice-amman-jordan| accessdate=2015-09-22| title=Temple of Human Sacrifice: Amman Jordan| work=Randy McCracken| date=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical period===
[[File:A Roman Temple Sunset View in Jabal Al-Qalaa' Amman.jpg|thumb|Temple of Hercules at the Amman Citadel (Jabal Al-Qalaa)]]
Conquest of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] firmly consolidated the influence of [[Hellenistic period#Culture|Hellenistic culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_hellenistic.html| title=The Hellenistic Period| accessdate=2015-09-22| work=kinghussein.gov.jo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including [[Umm Qays]], [[Jerash]] and Amman. [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, who occupied and rebuilt the city, named it &quot;Philadelphia&quot; ({{lang-grc|Φιλαδέλφεια}}),  evoking &quot;brotherly love&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]].

One of the most original monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of [[Iraq Al-Amir]] in the valley of [[Wadi Al-Seer|Wadi Al-Sir]], southwest of Amman, which is home to [[Qasr Al-Abd]] (Castle of the Slave).

[[File:Amman Amphitheater 03.JPG|thumb|left|[[Roman theater (Jordan)|The Roman Theatre]] built around 100 AD]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered much of the [[Levant]] in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the northern modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), [[Jerash|Gerasa]], [[Umm Qays|Gedara]], [[Pella]] and [[Irbid|Arbila]] joined with other cities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]; [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]], [[Hippos]], [[Capitolias]], [[Qanawat|Canatha]] and [[Damascus]] to form the [[Decapolis|Decapolis League]], a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;doa.gov.jo&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=sublinks&amp;SlID=5024&amp;MlID=8| title=The History of a Land| accessdate=2015-09-30| work=Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities| publisher=Department of Antiquities| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923215527/http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=sublinks&amp;SlID=5024&amp;MlID=8| archive-date=2015-09-23| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from [[Aqaba|Ailah]] to Damascus that was built by Emperor [[Trajan]] in 106 AD. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time. During the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era in the seventh century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Tourism| work=kinghussein.gov.jo| publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo| accessdate=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country, some of which exist in Amman, such as the [[Temple of Hercules (Amman)|Temple of Hercules]] at the [[Amman Citadel]], the [[Roman theater (Amman)|Roman Theatre]], the [[Odeon theater (Amman)|Odeon]], and the [[Nymphaeum (Amman)|Nymphaeum]]. The two theatres and the Nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small [[Odeon (building)|odeon]]. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a {{convert|600|m2|sp=us}} pool which was {{convert|3|m|sp=us}} deep and was continuously refilled with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/tourism1.html| title=Amman| publisher=kinghussein.gov.jo| accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umayyad Palace020.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Umayyad Palace]] on top of the [[Amman Citadel]] built around 700 AD]]
In the 630s, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered the region from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed &quot;Amman&quot; by the Muslims and became part of the district of [[Jund al-Urdunn]]. A large part of the population already spoke [[Arabic]], which facilitated integration into the [[caliphate]], as well as several conversions to [[Islam]]. Under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous [[desert castle]]s were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the [[Amman Citadel]] hill, known today as the [[Umayyad Palace]]. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were [[Abbasid Revolution|overthrown]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;doa.gov.jo&quot;/&gt;

The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the [[Crusades|Crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources.

During the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] era (late 13th–early 16th centuries), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province).&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2015, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of [[Hisban]], which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely [[Ajlun]] and al-Karak.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2015, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1321, the geographer [[Abu'l Fida]], recorded that Amman was &quot;a very ancient town&quot; with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strange392&quot;/&gt; For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a ''madina'' (city).&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker120&quot;&gt;Walker 2015, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1357, Emir [[Sirghitmish]] bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the [[Madrasa of Sarghatmish|Madrasa of Sirghitmish]], which he built in [[Cairo]] that same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker120&quot;/&gt; After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker120&quot;/&gt; Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker120&quot;/&gt;

Ownership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the ''na'ib as-saltana'' (viceroy) of Damascus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker120&quot;/&gt; Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the ''na'ib as-saltana'' of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2015, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2015, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East |series=The Contemporary Middle East (Book 5) |author=Dawn Chatty |year=2010 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=116–117 |isbn=9780521817929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OsgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McEvedy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cities of the Classical World: An Atlas and Gazetteer of 120 Centres of Ancient Civilization |author=Colin McEvedy |year=2011 |location=London |publisher=Allen Lane/Penguin Books |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZowqTafiacC&amp;pg=PT37|isbn=9780141967639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire]] annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, [[al-Salt]] functioned as the virtual political centre of Transjordan.

Because of its location along the railway, Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=map&amp;SlID=5101&amp;city=amman| title=Amman Governorate| accessdate=2015-09-22| publisher=Department of Antiquities| work=Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923055955/http://www.doa.gov.jo/En/inside.php?src=map&amp;SlID=5101&amp;city=amman| archive-date=2015-09-23| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Battle of Amman|First]] and [[Second Battle of Amman]] were part of the [[Middle Eastern theater of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] of [[World War I]] and the [[Arab Revolt]], taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the [[Sharifian Army|Hashemite Arab army]] facilitated the British advance towards [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA98| title=Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History| author1=Spencer C.

In 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]] designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which became the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the [[Jordan River]] at the time. The early settlers who came from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were overwhelmingly from [[Nablus]], from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly [[Al Karak]] and [[Madaba]]. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Reem Khamis-Dakwar |author2=Karen Froud |date=2014 |title=Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics XXVI: Papers from the annual symposium on Arabic Linguistics.

Jordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. A second wave arrived after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordanian Army]] known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JWT&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jordanwildernesstours.com/amman.htm| title=Amman| accessdate=2015-09-22| work=Jordan Wild Tours}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of Iraqi and Kuwaiti refugees settled in the city after the 1991 [[Gulf War]], with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

During the last ten years, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.  Amman is the site of major mega projects such as the [[Abdali Urban Regeneration Project]] and the [[Jordan Gate Towers]]. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons Hotel Amman]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotel Amman]], [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Amman]], [[St. Regis Hotel|St. Regis Hotel Amman]], [[Le Royal Hotel (Amman)|Le Royal Hotel]] and others.

===Climate===
[[File:SPRING IN AMMAN 1.JPG|thumb|right|Spring in an affluent neighbourhood in the city]]

Amman's position on the mountains near the [[Mediterranean climate]] zone places it under the [[semi-arid climate]] classification ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate]]: BSh borders on BSk). Summers are moderately long, mildly hot and breezy; however, one or two heat waves may occur during summer. Spring is brief and warm, where highs reach {{convert|28|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Spring usually starts between April and May, and lasts about a month. Winter usually starts around the end of November and continues from early to mid-March. Temperatures are usually near or below {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with snow occasionally falling once or twice a year. Rain averages about {{convert|300|mm|0|abbr=on}} a year and periodic droughts are common, where most rain falls between October and April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherspark.com/averages/32846/10/Amman-Jordan |title=Average Weather in October For Amman, Jordan |publisher=WeatherSpark |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 120 days of heavy fog per year is usual.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityscape.jo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityscape.jo/page/about-jordan |title=Real Estate in Amman and Jordan for Apartments and Villas – Rent &amp; Buy |publisher=Cityscape.jo |accessdate=2013-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223357/http://cityscape.jo/page/about-jordan |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difference in elevation plays a major role in the different weather conditions experienced in the city: snow may accumulate in the western and northern parts of Amman (an average altitude of {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) while at the same time it could be raining at the city centre (elevation of {{cvt|700|m}}.{{clarify|reason=both elevations are the same, contradicts sentence about elevation differences|date=November 2020}}

Amman has extreme examples of [[microclimate]], and almost every district exhibits its own weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arlt-lectures.com/jordan-amman.pdf |title=&quot;Ever-growing Amman&quot;, Jordan: Urban expansion, social polarisation and contemporary urban planning issues |publisher=Arlt-lectures.com |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu Nser are among the coldest in the city, and can experience frost while other districts such as Marka experience much warmer temperatures.

The temperatures listed below are taken from the weather station at the centre of the city which is at an elevation of {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=}}  [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. At higher elevations, the temperatures will be lower during winter and higher during summer. For example, in areas such as al-Jubaiha, Sweileh, Khalda, and Abu Nser, Tabarbour, Basman which are at/higher than {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level have average temperatures of {{convert|7|to|9|C|F|abbr=on}} in the day and {{convert|1|to|3|C|F|abbr=on}} at night in January. In August, the average high temperatures in these areas are {{convert|25|to|28|C|F|abbr=on}} in the day and {{convert|14|to|16|C|F|abbr=on}} at night.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

==Local government==
{{See also|List of mayors of Amman}}

Amman is governed by a 41-member city council elected in four-year term direct elections. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian [[Ismael Babouk]] who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district centre was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/ar/gam/council.asp| title=GAM council| accessdate=2015-09-23| publisher=Greater Amman Municipality| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002043553/http://ammancity.gov.jo/ar/gam/council.asp| archivedate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a [[environmentally friendly|green metropolis]] by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is [[urban open space|green space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/editorial/greener-amman| title=For a greener Amman| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-09-09| publisher=The Jordan News| work=[[The Jordan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including [[Wakalat Street]], [[Rainbow Street]], [[The Hashemite Plaza]], Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Centre, Al Hussein Cultural Center, [[Al Hussein Public Parks]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-have-free-wi-fi-service-15-selected-locations| title=Amman to have free Wi-Fi service in 15 selected locations| accessdate=2015-09-23| date=2015-05-25| publisher=The Jordan News| work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
[[Jordan]] is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. [[Amman Governorate]] divides into nine [[Nahias of Jordan|districts]], five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moi.gov.jo/arabic/pages/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.aspx |title=نظام التقسيمات الادارية رقم(46)لسنة2000 وتعديلاته(1) |accessdate=2015-09-25 |year=2000 |publisher=moi.gov.jo |language=Arabic |work=Ministry of Interiors Jordan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926111544/http://moi.gov.jo/arabic/pages/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9.aspx |archivedate=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

===Banking sector===
The [[bank]]ing sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the [[Amman Stock Exchange]]. Amman is the base city for the international [[Arab Bank]], one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by [[market capitalization]] on the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.awraq.com/uploads/research/b7e73be8b70e8bd319cbf637c046d178e431ccdb.pdf| title=Jordan Banking Sector Brief| accessdate=2015-09-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305065843/http://www.awraq.com/uploads/research/b7e73be8b70e8bd319cbf637c046d178e431ccdb.pdf| archive-date=5 March 2016| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:RJ bld, Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Royal Jordanian Airlines]] headquarters in Amman]]

Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8&amp;nbsp;million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=MasterCard Worldwide | url=http://www.slideshare.net/MasterCardNews/global-destination-cities-index-slideshare-final | title=MasterCard Worldwide's Global Destination Cities Index | publisher=Slideshare.net | accessdate=2012-11-28 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718210425/http://www.slideshare.net/MasterCardNews/global-destination-cities-index-slideshare-final | archivedate=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of [[Queen Alia International Airport]] is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;capacity&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Maslen |first=Richard |date=27 March 2013 |title=New Terminal Opening Boosts Queen Alia Airport's Capacity |url=http://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/190852/new-terminal-opening-boosts-queen-alia-airports-capacity-/ |newspaper=Routesonline |location=Manchester, United Kingdom |publisher=[[UBM Information]] Ltd |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for [[medical tourism]]. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jordantimes.com/jordan-remains-medical-tourism-hub-despite-regional-unrest |title=Jordan remains medical tourism hub despite regional unrest |newspaper=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203034646/http://jordantimes.com/jordan-remains-medical-tourism-hub-despite-regional-unrest |archivedate=2012-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
Amman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. Jordan's main airport, [[Queen Alia International Airport]], is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier [[Royal Jordanian]], a major airline in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/august/i_bca01.pdf|title=Royal Jordanian was the first airline in the Middle East to order the 787 Dreamliner|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline is headquartered in [[Zahran district]]. [[Rubicon Group Holding]] and [[Maktoob]], two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as [[Hikma Pharmaceuticals]], one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and [[Aramex]], the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraq-businessnews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hussein Hachem |url=http://www.busmanagementme.com/article/aramex-middle-easts-biggest-courier-firm/ |title=Aramex MEA: the Middle East's biggest courier firm&amp;nbsp;– Lead Features&amp;nbsp;– Business Management Middle East &amp;#124; GDS Publishing |publisher=Busmanagementme.com |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] and [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region.&lt;ref name=&quot;duniafrontier.com&quot;/&gt; In ''FDI'' magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraq-businessnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2011/03/16/erbil-ranked-5th-for-foreign-direct-investment/ |title=Erbil Ranked 5th for Foreign Direct Investment |publisher=Iraq Business News |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including [[Standard Chartered]], [[Société Générale]], and [[Citibank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prlog.org/10313193-courier-companies-of-the-world.html |title=Courier Companies of the World |publisher=PRLog |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; It has a land area of {{convert|648.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} which yields a population density of about {{convert|2380|PD/km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.permaculturenews.org/files/ipc10/Lancaster_Water_Harvesting_Jordan-9-2011.pdf| title=Turning Drains into Sponges and Water Scarcity into Water Abundance| work=Brad Lancaster| publisher=permaculturenews.org| accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;S34&quot;&gt;Dumper and Stanley, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of [[Circassians]] settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Albala, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; After Amman became a major hub along the [[Hejaz Railway]] in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.&lt;ref&gt;Dakwar, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suleiman101&quot;&gt;Suleiman, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from [[Safed]], [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plascov33&quot;/&gt; Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from [[Nablus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dakwar, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from [[Jaffa]], [[Ramla]] and [[Lod|Lydda]], to Amman,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plascov33&quot;&gt;Plascov, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; whose population swelled to 110,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suleiman101&quot;/&gt; With Jordan's capture of the [[West Bank]] during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the [[Six-Day War|1967 War]]. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suleiman101&quot;/&gt; A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Several large [[Palestinian refugee camp]]s exist around the centre of Amman.&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;S35&quot;&gt;Dumper and Stanley, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic [[dialect]], although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as &quot;Ammani&quot;, unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Amman has a mostly [[Sunni Muslim]] population, and the city contains numerous [[mosque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Salkin and LaBoda, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the main mosques is the large [[King Abdullah I Mosque]], built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic [[dome]] beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;JordanTravel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantoursandtravel.com/amman.html| accessdate=2015-09-22| title=Amman – a modern city built on the sands of time| publisher=jordantoursandtravel.com| work=Jordan Travel| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030150/http://www.jordantoursandtravel.com/amman.html| archive-date=2016-03-04| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-coloured walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Maliki]], Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, [[Ibadi]], tassawuf-related [[Sufism]], [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Security Watch—Jordan – Page 134, W. Andrew Terrill – 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Amman also has a small [[Druze]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=U.S. Senate: Committee on Foreign Relations |title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004| publisher=[[Government Printing Office]]| year=2005| page=563| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA563|isbn=978-0-16-072552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a parent has a drug or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] problem, the attention in the household is on the parents rather than the child. This neglect of the child leads to the lowering of their self-esteem and helps develop a fantasy world in which they are in control. Hickey's Trauma Control Model supports how the neglect from parents can facilitate deviant behavior, especially if the child sees substance abuse in action.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=107}} This then leads to [[disposition]] (the inability to attach), which can further lead to homicidal behavior, unless the child finds a way to develop substantial relationships and fight the label they receive. If a child receives no support from anyone, then he or she is unlikely to recover from the [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] event in a positive way. As stated by E. E. Maccoby, &quot;the family has continued to be seen as a major—perhaps ''the'' major—arena for socialization&quot;.{{sfn|Maccoby|1992|pp=1006–17}}

====Chromosomal make up====
There have been recent studies looking into the possibility that an abnormality with one's [[chromosome]]s could be the trigger for serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201803/do-all-serial-killers-have-genetic-predisposition-kill|title=Do All Serial Killers Have a Genetic Predisposition to Kill? - Exploring a Complex Question|website=Psychology Today|author=Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two serial killers, [[Bobby Joe Long]] and [[Richard Speck]], came to attention for reported chromosomal abnormalities. Long had an [[Klinefelter syndrome|extra X chromosome]].  Speck was erroneously reported to have an [[XYY syndrome|extra Y chromosome]]; in fact, his [[karyotype]] was performed twice and was normal each time.  Hellen Morrison, an American forensic psychiatrist, said in an interview that while researchers have not identified a specific causal gene, the fact that the majority of serial killers are male leads researchers to believe there is &quot;a change associated with the male chromosome make up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodgers|first=Abby|title=A Terrifying Glimpse into The Mind of a Serial Killer|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/12-shocking-and-twisted-facts-about-the-worlds-serial-killers-2012-6?op=1|work=Business Insider|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fantasy====
Children who do not have the [[Power (social and political)|power]] to control the mistreatment they suffer sometimes create a new reality to which they can escape. This new reality becomes their [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] that they have total control of and becomes part of their daily existence. In this fantasy world, their emotional development is guided and maintained. According to Garrison (1996), &quot;the child becomes [[sociopathic]] because the normal development of the concepts of right and wrong and [[empathy]] towards others is retarded because the child's emotional and [[Social change|social development]] occurs within his self-centered fantasies. A person can do no wrong in his own world and the pain of others is of no consequence when the purpose of the fantasy world is to satisfy the needs of one person&quot; (Garrison, 1996). Boundaries between fantasy and reality are lost and fantasies turn to dominance, control, sexual conquest, and violence, eventually leading to murder. Fantasy can lead to the first step in the process of a dissociative state, which, in the words of Stephen Giannangelo, &quot;allows the serial killer to leave the stream of consciousness for what is, to him, a better place&quot;.{{sfn|Giannangelo|1996|p=33}}

[[Criminology|Criminologist]] Jose Sanchez reports, &quot;the young criminal you see today is more detached from his victim, more ready to hurt or kill.  The lack of empathy for their victims among young criminals is just one symptom of a problem that afflicts the whole society.&quot;{{sfn|Tithecott|1997|p=38}} Lorenzo Carcaterra, author of ''Gangster'' (2001), explains how potential criminals are [[Labeling theory|labeled by society]], which can then lead to their offspring also developing in the same way through the [[cycle of violence]]. The ability for serial killers to appreciate the mental life of others is severely compromised, presumably leading to their dehumanization of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Silva|Leong|Ferrari|2004|p=790}}, {{harvnb|Tithecott|1997|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process may be considered an expression of the intersubjectivity associated with a cognitive deficit regarding the capability to make sharp distinctions between other people and inanimate objects. For these individuals, objects can appear to possess animistic or humanistic power while people are perceived as objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Before he was executed, serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] stated media violence and pornography had stimulated and increased his need to commit homicide, although this statement was made during last-ditch efforts to appeal his death sentence.{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=162}} However, correlation is not causation (a disturbed physiological disposition, psychosis, lack of socialization, or aggressiveness may contribute to both fantasy creation and serial killing without fantasy creation generally contributing to serial killing for instance). There are exceptions to the typical fantasy patterns of serial killers, as in the case of [[Dennis Rader]], who was a loving family man and the leader of his church.

===Organized, disorganized, and mixed===
[[File:Ted Bundy headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ted Bundy]] in custody, Florida, United States, July 1978 (State Archives of Florida)]]

The [[FBI]]'s ''[[Crime Classification Manual]]'' places serial killers into three categories: ''organized'', ''disorganized'', and ''mixed'' (i.e., offenders who exhibit organized and disorganized characteristics).{{sfn|Vronsky|2004|pp=99–100}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PerperCina2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joshua A. Perper|author2=Stephen J.

Peck|author2=Norman Dolch|author3=Norman Allan Dolch|title=Extraordinary Behavior: A Case Study Approach to Understanding Social Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9lIoA5jurUC&amp;pg=PA253|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97057-4|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of [[Decompensation|psychological decompensation]] or overconfidence due to having evaded capture, or vice versa, as when a previously disorganized killer identifies one or more specific aspects of the act of killing as his/her source of gratification and develops a ''modus operandi'' structured around those.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Organized serial killers often plan their crimes methodically, usually abducting victims, killing them in one place and disposing of them in another. They often lure the victims with ploys appealing to their sense of sympathy. Others specifically target prostitutes, who are likely to go voluntarily with a stranger. These killers maintain a high degree of control over the [[crime scene]] and usually have a solid knowledge of [[forensic science]] that enables them to cover their tracks, such as burying the body or weighing it down and sinking it in a river. They follow their crimes in the news media carefully and often take pride in their actions as if it were all a grand project.{{sfn|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=113}}

Often, organized killers have social and other interpersonal skills sufficient to enable them to develop both personal and romantic relationships, friends and lovers and sometimes even attract and maintain a spouse and sustain a family including children. Among serial killers, those of this type are in the event of their capture most likely to be described by acquaintances as kind and unlikely to hurt anyone. [[Ted Bundy]] and [[John Wayne Gacy]] are examples of organized serial killers.{{sfn|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=113}} In general, the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]s of organized serial killers tend to be near normal range, with a mean of 94.7. Organized nonsocial offenders tend to be on the higher end of the average, with a mean IQ of 99.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;radfordfgcudb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Serial Killer Statistics|url=http://skdb.fgcu.edu/public/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics%206SEP2014.pdf|last=Aamodt|first=Dr. Mike|authorlink=Mike Aamodt|date=|website=|publisher=[[Radford University]]/[[Florida Gulf Coast University|FGCU]] Serial Killer Database|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215045712/http://skdb.fgcu.edu/public/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics%206SEP2014.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2015|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disorganized serial killers are usually far more impulsive, often committing their murders with a random weapon available at the time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body. They are likely to be unemployed, a loner, or both, with very few friends. They often turn out to have a history of mental illness, and their [[modus operandi]] (M.O.) or lack thereof is often marked by excessive violence and sometimes [[necrophilia]] or sexual violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serial Killers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/serial-killers |title=Serial Killers |accessdate=May 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309132810/http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/serial-killers |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a slightly lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 92.8.&lt;ref name=radfordfgcudb/&gt;

===Medical professionals===
{{Main|Angel of Mercy (criminology)}}
Some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death tend to be attracted to medical professions or acquiring such a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sitpond|2000|p={{Page needed|date=February 2011}}}}, {{harvnb|Whittle|Ritchie|2000|p={{Page needed|date=February 2011}}}}, {{harvnb|Linedecker|Burt|1990|p={{Page needed|date=February 2011}}}}, {{harvnb|Hickey|2010|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of killers are sometimes referred to as &quot;angels of death&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/angels/index.html |title=Angels of Death |journal=New Scientist |volume=225 |issue=3007 |pages=40–43 |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218133027/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/angels/index.html |archivedate=December 18, 2008 |bibcode=2015NewSc.225...40W |last1=Wires |first1=Linda |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(15)60268-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or angels of mercy. Medical professionals will kill their patients for money, for a sense of sadistic pleasure, for a belief that they are &quot;easing&quot; the patient's pain, or simply &quot;because they can&quot;.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=204}} Perhaps the most prolific of these was the British doctor [[Harold Shipman]]. Another such killer was nurse [[Jane Toppan]], who admitted during her murder trial that she was [[Lust murder|sexually aroused by death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Female_Lust_Kill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=When Women Kill Together |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |work=The Forensic Examiner |publisher=American College of Forensic Examiners Institute |date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829110653/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1613/is_1_16/ai_n29335603/ |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would administer a drug mixture to patients she chose as her victims, lie in bed with them and hold them close to her body as they died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Female_Lust_Kill&quot;/&gt;

Another medical professional serial killer is [[Genene Jones]]. It is believed she killed 11 to 46 infants and children while working at Bexar County Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Genene Jones Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/genene-jones-235417#criminal-background|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603170851/http://www.biography.com/people/genene-jones-235417|archive-date=3 June 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently serving a 99-year sentence for the murder of Chelsea McClellan and the attempted murder of Rolando Santos,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and became eligible for parole in 2017 due to a law in Texas at the time of her sentencing to reduce [[prison overcrowding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; A similar case occurred in Britain in 1991, where nurse [[Beverley Allitt]] killed four children at the hospital where she worked, attempted to kill three more, and injured a further six over the course of two months.

A 21st-century example is Canadian nurse [[Elizabeth Wettlaufer]] who murdered elderly patients in the nursing homes where she worked.

===Female===

Female serial killers are rare compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelleher 1998 12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kelleher|Kelleher|1998|p=12}}, {{harvnb|Wilson|Hilton|1998|pp=495–498}}, {{harvnb|Frei|Völlm|Graf|Dittmann|2006|pp=167–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources suggest that female serial killers represented less than one in every six known serial murderers in the United States between 1800 and 2004 (64 females from a total of 416 known offenders), or that around 15% of U.S. serial killers have been women, with a collective number of victims between 427 and 612.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickey|2010|pp=187, 257,266}}, {{harvnb|Vronsky|2007|p=9}}, {{harvnb|Farrell|Keppel|Titterington|2011|pp=228–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''Lethal Ladies'', Amanda L. Farrell, Robert D. Keppel, and Victoria B. Titterington, state that &quot;the Justice Department indicated 36 female serial killers have been active over the course of the last century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrell&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Farrell|Keppel|Titterington|2011|pp=228–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology'', there is evidence that 16% of all serial killers are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Newton|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelleher and Kelleher (1998) created several categories to describe female serial killers. They used the classifications of ''[[Wiktionary:black widow|black widow]]'', ''[[Angel of Death (Criminology)|angel of death]]'', ''sexual predator'', ''revenge'', ''profit or crime'', ''team killer'', ''question of sanity'', ''unexplained'', and ''unsolved''. In using these categories, they observed that most women fell into the categories of the black widow or team killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;/&gt; Although motivations for female serial killers can include attention seeking, addiction, or the result of psychopathological behavioral factors,&lt;ref name=&quot;concordia1&quot;/&gt; female serial killers are commonly categorized as murdering men for material gain, usually being emotionally close to their victims,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelleher 1998 12&quot;/&gt; and generally needing to have a relationship with the victim,&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frei|Völlm|Graf|Dittmann|2006|pp=167–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the traditional cultural image of the &quot;black widow&quot;. 

The methods that female serial killers use for murder are frequently covert or low-profile, such as murder by poison (the preferred choice for killing).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|Hilton|1998|pp=495–498}}, {{harvnb|Frei|Völlm|Graf|Dittmann|2006|pp=167–176}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=171}}, {{harvnb|Newton|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods used by female serial killers include shootings (used by 20%), suffocation (16%), stabbing (11%), and drowning (5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;concordia1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/Laurence/forensic/ProfileAnalysis1.ppt |title=Educated attempt to provide specific information about a certain type of suspect |publisher=Department of Psychology, Concordia University |format=PPT |year=2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081443/http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/Laurence/forensic/ProfileAnalysis1.ppt |archivedate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They commit killings in specific places, such as their home or a health-care facility, or at different locations within the same city or state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2007|pp=1, 42–43}}, {{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception to the typical characteristics of female serial killers is [[Aileen Wuornos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=31}}, {{harvnb|Fox|Levin|2005|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; who killed outdoors instead of at home, used a gun instead of poison, and killed strangers instead of friends or family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmid|2005|p=231}}, {{harvnb|Arrigo|Griffin|2004|pp=375–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; One &quot;analysis of 86 female serial killers from the United States found that the victims tended to be spouses, children or the elderly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;/&gt; Other studies indicate that since 1975, increasingly strangers are marginally the most preferred victim of female serial killers,{{sfn|Vronsky|2007|p=41}} or that only 26% of female serial killers kill for material gain only.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=267}} Sources state that each killer will have her own proclivities, needs and triggers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1998 495–498&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|Hilton|1998|pp=495–498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;/&gt; A review of the published literature on female serial murder stated that &quot;sexual or [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] motives are believed to be extremely rare in female serial murderers, and psychopathic traits and histories of childhood abuse have been consistently reported in these women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;/&gt; 

A study by Eric W. Hickey (2010) of 64 female serial killers in the United States indicated that sexual activity was one of several motives in 10% of the cases, enjoyment in 11% and control in 14% and that 51% of all U.S. female serial killers murdered at least one woman and 31% murdered at least one child.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=265}} In other cases, women have been involved as an accomplice with a male serial killer as a part of a serial killing team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson 1998 495–498&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frei&quot;/&gt; A 2015 study published in ''The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology'' found that the most common motive for female serial killers was for financial gain and almost 40% of them had experienced some sort of mental illness.{{sfn|Harrison|Murphy|Ho|Bowers2015|pp=383–406}}

[[Peter Vronsky]] in ''[[Female Serial Killers]]'' (2007) maintains that female serial killers today often kill for the same reason males do: as a means of expressing rage and control. He suggests that sometimes the theft of the victims' property by the female &quot;black widow&quot; type serial killer appears to be for material gain, but really is akin to a male serial killer's collecting of totems (souvenirs) from the victim as a way of exerting continued control over the victim and reliving it.{{sfn|Vronsky|2007}} By contrast, Hickey states that although popular perception sees &quot;black widow&quot; female serial killers as something of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] past, in his statistical study of female serial killer cases reported in the United States since 1826, approximately 75% occurred since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.today/794Pa Eric W. Hickey], (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Báthory]] is sometimes cited as the most prolific female serial killer in all of history. Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (Báthory Erzsébet in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], August 7, 1560 – August 21, 1614) was a countess from the renowned [[Báthory family]]. Before her husband's death, Elizabeth took great pleasure in torturing the staff, by jamming pins under the servant's fingernails or stripping servants and throwing them into the snow.{{sfn|Yardley|Wilson|2015|pp=1–26}} After her husband's death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and young women, with one witness attributing to them over 600 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later.{{sfn|Vronsky|2007|p=73}}

A 2010 article by Perri and Lichtenwald addressed some of the misperceptions concerning female criminality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perri&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Perri|Lichtenwald|2010|pp=50–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Perri and Lichtenwald analyze the current research regarding female psychopathy, including case studies of female psychopathic killers featuring [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]], cesarean section homicide, fraud detection homicide, female kill teams, and a female serial killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perri&quot;/&gt;

=== Juvenile ===
Juvenile serial killers are rare. There are three main categories that juvenile serial killers can fit into: primary, maturing, and secondary killers. There have been studies done to compare and contrast these three groups and to discover similarities and differences between them.{{sfn|Kirby|2009}} Although these types of serial killers are less common, oftentimes adult serial killers may make their debut at an early age and it can be an opportunity for researchers to study what factors brought about the behavior. Though it is rare, the youngest felon on death row is in fact, a juvenile serial killer named [[Harvey Miguel Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201207/youngest-serial-killer-death-row|title=Youngest Serial Killer on Death Row|website=Psychology Today|access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity and demographics in the United States ===
&lt;!-- NOTE: Refrain from adding too much information about one race and/or ethnicity, as to avoid bias and WP:UNDUE WEIGHT--&gt;

The racial demographics regarding serial killers are often subject to debate. In the United States, the majority of reported and investigated serial killers are white males, from a lower-to-middle-class background, usually in their late 20s to early 30s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot;/&gt; However, there are African American, Asian, and [[Hispanic America|Hispanic]] (of any race) serial killers as well, and, according to the FBI, based on percentages of the U.S. population, whites are not more likely than other races to be serial killers.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot;/&gt; [[Offender profiling|Criminal profiler]] [[Pat Brown (criminal profiler)|Pat Brown]] says serial killers are usually reported as white because serial killers usually target victims of their own race, and argues the media typically focuses on &quot;All-American&quot; [[Missing white woman syndrome|white and pretty female victims]] who were the targets of white male offenders; that crimes among [[Ethnic Minorities|minority]] offenders in urban communities, where crime rates are higher, are under-investigated; and that minority serial killers likely exist at the same ratios as white serial killers for the population. She believes that the myth that serial killers are always white might have become &quot;truth&quot; in some research fields due to the over-reporting of white serial killers in the media.{{sfn|Brown|2008|p=12}}

According to some sources, the percentage of serial killers who are African American is estimated to be between 13% and 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=N. R.

In a 2005 article Anthony Walsh, professor of criminal justice at Boise State University, argued a review of post-WWII serial killings in America finds that the prevalence of non-white serial killers has typically been drastically underestimated in both professional research literature and the mass media. As a paradigmatic case of this media double standard, Walsh cites news reporting on white killer [[Gary Heidnik]] and African-American killer [[Harrison Graham]]. Both men were residents of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania; both imprisoned, tortured, and killed several women; and both were arrested only months apart in 1987. &quot;Heidnik received widespread national attention, became the subject of books and television shows, and served as a model for the fictitious Buffalo Bill in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|Silence of the Lambs]]''&quot;, writes Walsh, while &quot;Graham received virtually no media attention outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, despite having been convicted of four more murders than Heidnik&quot;.{{sfn|Walsh|2005|pp=271–291}}

=== Outside the United States ===
There is not much research about serial homicide in non-Western countries, or outside the U.S. 

In one study of serial homicide in South Africa, many patterns were similar to established patterns in the U.S., with some exceptions: no offenders were female, offenders were lower educated than in the U.S., and both victims and offenders were predominantly black.&lt;ref name=&quot;South_Africa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=South African Serial Homicide: Offender and Victim Demographics and Crime Scene Actions |journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling|volume=12|pages=18–43|url=http://forensic-psychologist.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/South-African-Serial-Homicide-Offender-and-Victim-Demographics-and-Crime-Scene-Actions-2015.pdf|last=Salfati|first=Gabrielle|display-authors=etal  |year=2015|doi=10.1002/jip.1425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==
[[File:Michael Penttilä.jpg|thumb|upright|According to psychiatric reports, [[Jukka Lindholm]], the so-called &quot;serial strangler&quot; reportedly admired the primordial, violent manhood of his teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1444805886271.html| title = Vankilasta paenneen sarjakuristajan rikoshistoria on poikkeuksellisen synkkä| work = Ilta-Sanomat| date = 2015-10-14| accessdate = 2015-10-15| language = fi-FI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202112313/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1444805886271.html |archive-date=2016-02-02 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Motive (law)|motives]] of serial killers are generally placed into four categories: ''visionary'', ''mission-oriented'', ''hedonistic'', and ''power or control''; however, the motives of any given killer may display considerable overlap among these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|1998|pp=43–44}}, {{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visionary===
Visionary serial killers suffer from [[Psychosis|psychotic]] breaks with reality,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonn2014c&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Bonn|title=Why We Love Serial Killers: The Curious Appeal of the World's Most Savage Murderers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUJgBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT108|year=2014|publisher=Skyhorse|isbn=978-1-63220-189-8|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes believing they are another person or are compelled to murder by entities such as the [[Devil]] or God.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=62}} The two most common subgroups are &quot;demon mandated&quot; and &quot;God mandated&quot;.{{sfn|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=145}}

[[Herbert Mullin]] believed the American casualties in the [[Vietnam War]] were preventing California from experiencing [[Megathrust earthquake#The Big One|the Big One]]. As the war wound down, Mullin claimed his father instructed him via [[telepathy]] to raise the number of &quot;human sacrifices to nature&quot; to delay a catastrophic earthquake that would plunge California into the ocean.{{sfn|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=146}} [[David Berkowitz]] (&quot;Son of Sam&quot;) may also be an example of a visionary serial killer, having claimed a demon transmitted orders through his neighbor's dog and instructed him to commit murder.{{sfn|Schechter|2003|p=291}} Berkowitz later described those claims as a hoax, as originally concluded by psychiatrist David Abrahamsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Demons of 'Son of Sam' |date=July 1, 1979 |last=Abrahamsen |first=David |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/139894111 |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |volume=101 |issue= 168 |pages=2G,5G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission-oriented===
Mission-oriented killers typically justify their acts as &quot;ridding the world&quot; of certain types of people perceived as undesirable, such as the [[homeless]], [[ex-cons]], homosexuals, [[Substance abuse|drug users]], prostitutes, or people of different ethnicity or religion; however, they are generally not psychotic.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=43}} Some see themselves as attempting to change society, often to cure a societal ill.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2002|p=112}}

An example of a mission-oriented killer would be [[Joseph Paul Franklin]], an American [[white supremacist]] who exclusively targeted [[Jewish]], [[biracial]], and [[African-American]] individuals for the purpose of inciting a &quot;[[race war]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox19.com/2020/02/18/worst-serial-killer-i-ever-dealt-with-confession-joseph-paul-franklin/|title='The worst serial killer I ever dealt with': The confession of Joseph Paul Franklin|first=Jason|last=Scott|website=https://www.fox19.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201809/understanding-pragmatic-mission-killers|title=Understanding Pragmatic Mission Killers|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hedonistic===
This type of serial killer seeks thrills and derives pleasure from killing, seeing people as expendable means to this goal. [[Forensic psychology|Forensic psychologists]] have identified three subtypes of the hedonistic killer: &quot;lust&quot;, &quot;thrill&quot;, and &quot;comfort&quot;.{{sfn|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}

====Lust====
[[File:Paul Durousseau.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Paul Durousseau]] raped and murdered at least seven young women.]]

Sex is the primary motive of lust killers, whether or not the victims are dead, and fantasy plays a large role in their killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartolBartol2008&quot;/&gt; Their sexual gratification depends on the amount of torture and [[mutilation]] they perform on their victims. The sexual serial murderer has a psychological need to have absolute control, dominance, and power over their victims, and the infliction of torture, pain, and ultimately death is used in an attempt to fulfill their need.{{sfn|Myers|McElroy|Burton|Recoppa|1993|pp=435–451}} They usually use weapons that require close contact with the victims, such as knives or hands. As lust killers continue with their murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|2001|p=163}}, {{harvnb|Dobbert|2004|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Bianchi]], one of the &quot;[[Hillside Strangler]]s&quot;, murdered women and girls of different ages, races, and appearance because his sexual urges required different types of stimulation and increasing intensity.{{sfn|Dobbert|2004|p=10-11}} [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] searched for his perfect fantasy lover—beautiful, submissive and eternal. As his desire increased, he experimented with drugs, alcohol, and exotic sex. His increasing need for stimulation was demonstrated by the dismemberment of victims, whose heads and genitals he preserved, and by his attempts to create a &quot;living zombie&quot; under his control (by pouring acid into a hole drilled into the victim's skull).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giannangelo|2012}}, {{harvnb|Fulero|Wrightsman|2008}}, {{harvnb|Dvorchak|Holewa|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dahmer once said, &quot;Lust played a big part of it. Control and lust. Once it happened the first time, it just seemed like it had control of my life from there on in. The killing was just a means to an end. That was the least satisfactory part. I didn't enjoy doing that. That's why I tried to create living zombies with acid and the drill.&quot; He further elaborated on this, also saying, &quot;I wanted to see if it was possible to make—again, it sounds really gross—uh, zombies, people that would not have a will of their own, but would follow my instructions without resistance. So after that, I started using the drilling technique.&quot;{{sfn|MacCormick|2003|p=431}} He experimented with [[cannibalism]] to &quot;ensure his victims would always be a part of him&quot;.{{sfn|Dobbert|2004|p=11}}

====Thrill====
{{Main|Thrill killing}}
The primary motive of a thrill killer is to induce pain or terror in their victims, which provides stimulation and excitement for the killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartolBartol2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curt R. Bartol|author2=Anne M. Bartol|title=Introduction to Forensic Psychology: Research and Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=on2XfplaMTQC&amp;pg=PA285|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5830-1|pages=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seek the [[adrenaline]] rush provided by hunting and killing victims. Thrill killers murder only for the kill; usually, the attack is not prolonged, and there is no sexual aspect. Usually, the victims are strangers, although the killer may have followed them for a period of time. Thrill killers can abstain from killing for long periods of time and become more successful at killing as they refine their [[Modus operandi|murder methods]]. Many attempt to commit the [[perfect crime]] and believe they will not be caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Howard|Smith|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Robert Hansen]] took his victims to a secluded area, where he would let them loose and then hunt and kill them.{{sfn|Howard|Smith|2004|p=4}} In one of his letters to [[San Francisco Bay Area]] newspapers in San Francisco, California, the [[Zodiac Killer]] wrote &quot;[killing] gives me the most thrilling experience it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl&quot;.{{sfn|Graysmith|2007|pp=54–55}} [[Carl Watts]] was described by a surviving victim as &quot;excited and hyper and clappin' and just making noises like he was excited, that this was gonna be fun&quot; during the 1982 attack.&lt;ref name=Cbs2004&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/14/60minutes/main649363.shtml | title = A Deal With the Devil? | publisher = [[60&amp;nbsp;Minutes]] | date = October 14, 2004 |accessdate = June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slashing, stabbing, hanging, drowning, asphyxiating, and strangling were among the ways Watts killed.{{sfn|Mitchell|2006|pp=207–208}}

====Comfort (profit)====

Material gain and a comfortable lifestyle are the primary motives of comfort killers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartolBartol2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Curt R. Bartol|author2=Anne M. Bartol|title=Criminal &amp; Behavioral Profiling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYcgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT197|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-8908-3|pages=197–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the victims are family members and close acquaintances.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartolBartol2008&quot;/&gt; After a murder, a comfort killer will usually wait for a period of time before killing again to allow any suspicions by family or authorities to subside. They often use poison, most notably [[arsenic]], to kill their victims. Female serial killers are often comfort killers, although not all comfort killers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Schlesinger|2000|p=276}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|2000|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contract killing|Contract killers]] (&quot;hitmen&quot;) may exhibit serial killers traits, but are generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional incentives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Madjd-Sadjadi2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi|title=The Economics of Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dd7XAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT162|year=2013|publisher=Business Expert Press|isbn=978-1-60649-583-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=7}}&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonYardley2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Wilson|author2=Elizabeth Yardley|author3=Adam Lynes|title=Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXg7CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|year=2015|publisher=Waterside Press - Drew University|isbn=978-1-909976-21-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that  are labeled  as both a hitmen and a serial killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonYardley2015a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Wilson|author2=Elizabeth Yardley|author3=Adam Lynes|title=Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXg7CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|year=2015|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=978-1-909976-21-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Kuklinski]] who worked for the [[American Mafia]] earned  tens of thousands of dollars for a &quot;hit&quot; also killed  for self gratification with no financial incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=RJ Parker, Ph.D.|author2=Dr. Scott Bonn|title=Blood Money: The Method and Madness of Assassins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib4pDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-987902-34-1|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HolmesHolmes2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald M.

===Power/control===
[[File:Illustrated Police News - Jack the Ripper 2.png|thumb| A policeman discovering the body of [[Catherine Eddowes]], one of [[Jack the Ripper]]'s victims]]
The main objective for this type of serial killer is to gain and exert [[Power (social and political)|power]] over their victim. Such killers are sometimes [[child abuse|abused as children]], leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers [[sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egger|first=Steven A.|year=2000|title=Why Serial Murderers Kill: An Overview|journal=Contemporary Issues Companion: Serial Killers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Bundy]] is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.{{sfn|Peck|Dolche|2000|p=255}}

===Media influences===
Many serial killers claim that a violent culture influenced them to commit murders. During his final interview, [[Ted Bundy]] stated that [[hardcore pornography]] was responsible for his actions. Others idolise figures for their deeds or perceived [[vigilante]] justice, such as [[Peter Kürten]], who idolized [[Jack the Ripper]], or [[John Wayne Gacy]] and [[Ed Kemper]], who both idolized the actor [[John Wayne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot; /&gt;

Killers who have a strong desire for fame or to be renowned for their actions desire media attention as a way of validating and spreading their crimes; fear is also a component here, as some serial killers enjoy causing fear. An example is [[Dennis Rader]], who sought attention from the press during his murder spree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/people/dennis-rader-241487|title = Dennis Rader|access-date = January 1, 2016|website = Biography|publisher = A&amp;E Television Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Many movies, books, and documentaries have been created, detailing serial killers' lives and crimes. For example, the biographical films ''[[Ted Bundy (film)|Ted Bundy]]'' (2002) and ''[[Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile]] '' focuses on serial killer [[Ted Bundy]]'s personal life in college, leading up to his execution, and ''[[Dahmer (film)|Dahmer]]'' (2002) tells the story of [[Jeffrey Dahmer]].

Serial killers are also portrayed in fictional media, oftentimes as having substantial intelligence and looking for difficult targets, despite the contradiction with the psychological profile of serial killers.{{sfn|Goldberg|Crespo|2003}}

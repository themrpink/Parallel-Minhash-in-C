'''Ava Lavinia Gardner''' (December 24, 1922 – January 25, 1990) was an American actress and singer. She first signed a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1941 and appeared mainly in small roles until she drew critics' attention in 1946 with her performance in [[Robert Siodmak]]'s [[Film noir|Noir]] film ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]''. She was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1953 for her performance in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Mogambo]]'', and in 1964 for best actress for both a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] for her performance in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|The Night of the Iguana]]''.

During the 1950s, Gardner established herself as a leading lady and one of the era's top stars with films like ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1951), ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'' (1951), ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952 film)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'' (1952), ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' (1954), ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956) and ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959). She continued her film career for three more decades, appearing in the films ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963), ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' (1966), ''[[Mayerling (1968 film)|Mayerling]]'' (1968), ''[[Tam-Lin (film)|Tam-Lin]]'' (1970), ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' (1976). She continued to act regularly until 1986, four years before her death in 1990, at the age of 67.

In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Gardner {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 25 on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legends]] of classic American cinema list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/stars50.pdf?docID=262 Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707093027/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/stars50.pdf?docID=262 |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on December 24, 1922, in [[Grabtown, Johnston County, North Carolina|Grabtown, North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ava-gardner-9306531|title=Ava Gardner|website=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of seven children. She had two older brothers, Raymond and Melvin, and four older sisters, Beatrice, Elsie Mae, Inez and Myra. Her parents, Mary Elizabeth &quot;Molly&quot; ([[née]] Baker; 1883–1943) and Jonas Bailey Gardner (1878–1938), were poor [[tobacco]] [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Server|first=Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrAnT9ZO9-cC&amp;q=Grabtown|title=Ava Gardner: &quot;Love Is Nothing&quot;|date=2007-04-01|publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4299-0874-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While accounts of her background vary, Ava's only documented ancestry was [[English people|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enskE0KWMQ4C&amp;pg=PA11 |title=Ava Gardner: &quot;Love is Nothing&quot;|isbn=978-0-312-31210-7|date=2007-05-15|last1=Server|first1=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=ava-gardner-1940s Ava Gardner 1940s], The Pop History Dig&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=68501 Ava Gardner profile], [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] website; accessed August 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was raised in the [[Baptists|Baptist]] faith of her mother. While the children were still young, the Gardners lost their property, and Molly received an offer to work as a cook and housekeeper at a dormitory for teachers at the nearby Brogden School that included board for the family and where Jonas continued sharecropping tobacco and supplemented the dwindling work with odd jobs at sawmills.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In 1931, the teachers school closed forcing the family to finally give up on their property dreams and they moved to a larger city, [[Newport News, Virginia]], where Molly found work managing a boarding house for the city's many shipworkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While in Newport News, Jonas became ill and died from [[bronchitis]] in 1938, when Ava was 15 years old. After her father's death, the family moved to Rock Ridge near [[Wilson, North Carolina]], where Molly ran another boarding house for teachers. Ava attended high school in Rock Ridge and she graduated from there in 1939. She then attended secretarial classes at [[Barton College|Atlantic Christian College]] in Wilson for about a year.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;''Encyclopedia of World Biography'' Vol. 25 (2005) Gale, Detroit&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Ava Gardner 1947.JPG|thumb|Gardner in 1947]]
Gardner was visiting her sister Beatrice in [[New York City]] in the summer of 1940, when Beatrice's husband Larry Tarr, a professional photographer, offered to take her portrait as a gift for her mother Molly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bean|first1=Kendra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBk9DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=ava+gardner+larry+tarr&amp;pg=PT36|title=Ava Gardner: A Life in Movies|last2=Uzarowski|first2=Anthony|date=2017-07-11|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-6043-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Server|first=Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enskE0KWMQ4C&amp;q=ava+gardner+larry+tarr&amp;pg=PA41|title=Ava Gardner: &quot;Love Is Nothing&quot;|date=2007-05-15|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-31210-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was so pleased with the results that he displayed the finished product in the front window of his Tarr Photography Studio on [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

A [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Theatres]] legal clerk, Barnard Duhan, spotted Gardner's portrait in Tarr's studio. At the time, Duhan often posed as an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) talent scout to meet girls, using the fact that MGM was a subsidiary of Loews. Duhan entered Tarr's studio and tried to get Gardner's number, but was rebuffed by the receptionist. Duhan made the comment, &quot;Somebody should send her info to MGM&quot;, and the Tarr's did so immediately. Shortly after, Gardner, who at the time was a student at Atlantic Christian College, traveled to New York to be interviewed at MGM's New York office by Al Altman, head of MGM's New York talent department. With cameras rolling, he directed the 18-year-old to walk towards the camera, turn and walk away, then rearrange some flowers in a vase.

[[File:The killers Ava.jpg|thumb|left|Gardner in ''The Killers'' (1946)]]
Her first appearance in a feature film was as a walk on in the [[Norma Shearer]] vehicle ''[[We Were Dancing (film)|We Were Dancing]]'' (1942). Fifteen [[bit part]]s later she received her first screen billing in ''[[3 Men in White]]'' (1944), a Dr. Kildare film in which she brings her mother to the hospital for treatment. After five years of bit parts, mostly at MGM and many of them uncredited, Gardner came to prominence in the [[Mark Hellinger]] production ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946), playing the ''[[femme fatale]]'' Kitty Collins.
[[File:Ava Gardner by Nickolas Muray, Modern Screen, 1952.jpg|thumb|left|Gardner on the cover of ''[[Modern Screen]]'' magazine, January 1952]]

Other notable films are ''[[The Hucksters]]'' (1947), ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1951), ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952 film)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'' (1952), ''[[Lone Star (1952 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1952), ''[[Mogambo]]'' (1953), ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' (1954), ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) and ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959). Off-camera, she could be witty and pithy, as in her assessment of director [[John Ford]], who directed ''Mogambo'' (&quot;The meanest man on earth. Thoroughly evil. Adored him!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/29/AR2006062901477.html ''Washington Post'' article, &quot;Movie Stars: The odd and amazing careers of Ava Gardner, Barbra Streisand, Patricia Neal, and Ed Sullivan&quot;], short reviews by Dennis Drabelle, ''Washington Post Book World'', July 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Barefoot Contessa'', she played the role of doomed beauty Maria Vargas, a fiercely independent woman who goes from Spanish dancer to international movie star with the help of a Hollywood director played by [[Humphrey Bogart]], with tragic consequences. Gardner's decision to accept the role was influenced by her own lifelong habit of going [[barefoot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Server&quot;/&gt; Gardner then played the role of [[Guinevere]] in ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1953), opposite actor [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] as [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]]. Indicative of her sophistication, she portrayed a duchess, a baroness and other ladies of royal lineage in her films of the 1950s.
[[File:Ava Gardner Snows Kilimanjaro.jpg|right|thumb|Gardner as Cynthia Green in ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952)]]

In 1960, she played the role of Soledad in ''[[The Angel Wore Red]]''. She was billed between [[Charlton Heston]] and [[David Niven]] for ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963), which was set in China during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900. The following year, she played her last major leading role in the critically acclaimed ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|The Night of the Iguana]]'' (1964), based upon a [[Tennessee Williams]] play, and starring [[Richard Burton]] as an [[atheist]] clergyman and [[Deborah Kerr]] as a gentle artist traveling with her aged poet grandfather. [[John Huston]] directed the movie in [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Mexico]], insisting on making the film in [[black and white]] – a decision he later regretted because of the vivid colors of the flora. Gardner received billing below Burton, but above Kerr. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her performance.
[[File:Ava Gardner in Bhowani Junction trailer.jpg|thumb|left|Gardner in a trailer for ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956)]]

She next appeared again with [[Burt Lancaster]], her co-star from ''The Killers'', this time along with [[Kirk Douglas]] and [[Fredric March]], in ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), a [[Thriller film|thriller]] about an attempted military takeover of the US government. Gardner played a former love interest of Lancaster's who could have been instrumental in Douglas's preventing a coup against the President of the United States.

John Huston chose Gardner for the part of [[Sarah]], the wife of [[Abraham]] (played by [[George C. Scott]]), in the [[Dino De Laurentiis]] film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'', which was released in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biblical Role Scares Ava&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Biblical Role Scares Ava|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19640906&amp;id=TM1YAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7338,1645328|access-date=2 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=September 6, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 interview, she talked about why she accepted the role:

{{quote|He [Huston] had more faith in me than I did myself. Now I'm glad I listened, for it is a challenging role and a very demanding one. I start out as a young wife, and age through various periods, forcing me to adjust psychologically to each age. It is a complete departure for me, and most intriguing. In this role, I must create a character, not just play one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biblical Role Scares Ava&quot; /&gt;}}

Two years later, in 1966, Gardner briefly sought the role of Mrs. Robinson in [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967). She reportedly called Nichols and said, &quot;I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!&quot; Nichols never seriously considered her for the part, preferring to cast a younger woman ([[Anne Bancroft]] was 35, while Gardner was 44), but he did visit her hotel, where he later recounted, &quot;she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star cliché. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of New Hollywood''. New York: Penguin Books, 2008, p. 238&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner moved to [[London]] in 1968, undergoing an elective [[hysterectomy]] to allay her worries of contracting the [[uterine cancer]] that had claimed the life of her mother. That year, she appeared in ''[[Mayerling (1968 film)|Mayerling]]'', in which she played the supporting role of Austrian [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], opposite [[James Mason]] as Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].

She appeared in a number of [[disaster films]] throughout the 1970s, notably ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974) with Heston, ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' (1976) with Lancaster, and the Canadian movie ''[[City on Fire (1979 film)|City on Fire]]'' (1979). She appeared briefly as [[Lillie Langtry]] at the end of ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'' (1972), and in ''[[The Blue Bird (1976 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1976). Her last movie was ''Regina Roma'' (1982). In the 1980s, she acted primarily on television, including the miniseries remake of ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'' and in a story arc on ''[[Knots Landing]]'' (both 1985).

=== Marriages ===

Soon after Gardner arrived in [[Los Angeles]], she met fellow MGM contract player [[Mickey Rooney]]; they married on January 10, 1942. The ceremony was held in the remote town of [[Ballard, California]], because MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] was worried that fans would desert Rooney's [[Andy Hardy]] movie series if it became known that their star was married. Gardner divorced Rooney in 1943, citing mental cruelty;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ava Gardner and Mickey Rooney Divorce Papers.

Gardner's second marriage was equally brief, to jazz musician and bandleader [[Artie Shaw]], from 1945 to 1946. Shaw had previously been married to [[Lana Turner]]. Gardner's third and last marriage was to singer and actor [[Frank Sinatra]], from 1951 to 1957. She later said in her autobiography that he was the love of her life. Sinatra left his wife Nancy for Gardner, and their subsequent marriage made headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frank Sinatra and Bride Fly to Miami on Honeymoon Trip |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1951-11-08/ed-1/seq-3/ |work=Evening Star |date=November 8, 1951 |page=Image 3, col 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinatra was blasted by gossip columnists [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Louella Parsons]], the Hollywood establishment, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], and by his fans for leaving his wife for a ''[[femme fatale]]''. Gardner used her considerable influence, particularly with [[Harry Cohn]], to get Sinatra cast in his [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Oscar]]-winning role in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953). That role and the award revitalized both Sinatra's acting and singing careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|date=2007-07-01|title=His Second Act|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/07/his-second-act/305979/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gardner-Sinatra marriage was tumultuous. Gardner confided to Artie Shaw, her second husband, that, &quot;With him [Frank], it's impossible... It's like being with a woman. He's so gentle. It's as though he thinks I'll break, as though I'm a piece of [[Dresden china]], and he's gonna hurt me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, James, Frank The Voice, Doubleday, 2010, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, Gardner became pregnant twice, but aborted both pregnancies. &quot;MGM had all sorts of penalty clauses about their stars having babies&quot;, according to her autobiography, which was published 8 months after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ava. ''Ava: My Story''. New York: Bantam, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner and Sinatra remained good friends for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystory&quot; /&gt; Of the support Sinatra gave Gardner, [[Ian McKellen]] commented that &quot;If you have been married to Frank Sinatra, you don't need an agent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDu_352HWq4?t=594|title=Conversations with Sir Ian McKellen|date=2015-10-16|author=Dave Karger, Fandango}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships ===
[[File:Ava Gardner.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Gardner at Kastrup Airport CPH in [[Copenhagen]] (1955)]]
Gardner became a friend of businessman and aviator [[Howard Hughes]] in the early to mid-1940s, and the relationship lasted into the 1950s. Gardner stated in her autobiography, ''Ava: My Story'', that she was never in love with Hughes, but he was in and out of her life for about 20 years. Hughes' trust in Gardner was what kept their relationship alive. She described him as &quot;painfully shy, completely enigmatic, and more eccentric ... than anyone [she] had ever met&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystory&quot;&gt;Gardner, Ava. ''Ava: My Story''. New York: Bantam Books.&lt;!-- ISBN, year, pages needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gardner divorced Sinatra in 1957, she went to Spain, where she began a friendship with writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] (she had starred in an adaptation of his ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' that year, and five years earlier, Hemingway had successfully urged producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] to cast Gardner in ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952 film)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'', a film which adapted several of his short stories). While staying with Hemingway at his villa in [[Cotorro|San Francisco de Paula]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], Gardner once swam alone without a swimsuit in his pool. After watching her, Hemingway ordered his staff: &quot;The water is not to be emptied&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Bell. [http://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-gail-bell-ghost-writers--2302 &quot;Ghost Writers&quot;], ''[[The Monthly]]'' (March 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Her friendship with Hemingway led to her becoming a fan of bullfighting and bullfighters, such as [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]], who became her lover. &quot;It was a sort of madness, honey&quot;, she later said of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystory&quot; /&gt;

Gardner was also involved in a relationship with her live-in boyfriend and companion, American actor [[Benjamin Tatar]], who worked in Spain as a foreign-language dubbing director.&lt;ref name=ppg&gt;{{cite news|first=Patricia|last=Sabatini|title=Obituary: Benjamin Tatar/Actor was Jackie Gleason's aide, lived with Ava Gardner|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/obituaries/obituary-benjamin-tatar-actor-was-jackie-gleasons-aide-lived-with-ava-gardner-664593|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2012-12-02|access-date=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatar later wrote an autobiography in which he discussed his relationship with Gardner, though the book was never published.&lt;ref name=ppg /&gt;

=== Religion and political views ===
Although Gardner was exposed to [[Christianity]] throughout her early years, she was an [[atheist]] later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pg/Ava_Gardner.html|title=The religion of Ava Gardner, actress|website=www.adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ffrf.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/25888-ava-gardner|title=Ava Gardner – Freedom From Religion Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion never played a positive role in her life, according to biographers and Gardner, in her autobiography ''Ava: My Story''. Her friend Zoe Sallis, who met her on the set of ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' when Gardner was living with [[John Huston]] in Puerto Vallarta, said Gardner always seemed unconcerned about religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffrf.org&quot; /&gt; When Sallis asked her about religion once, Gardner replied, &quot;It doesn't exist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffrf.org&quot; /&gt; Another factor that contributed to this was the death of Gardner's father in her youth, &quot;Nobody wanted to know Daddy when he was dying. He was so alone. He was scared. I could see the fear in his eyes when he was smiling. I went to see the preacher, the guy who'd baptized me. I begged him to come and visit Daddy, just to talk to him, you know? Give him a blessing or something. But he never did. He never came. God, I hated him. Cold-ass bastards like that ought to ... I don't know ... they should be in some other racket, I know that. I had no time for religion after that. I never prayed. I never said another prayer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffrf.org&quot; /&gt; Concerning politics, Gardner was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Server&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enskE0KWMQ4C&amp;q=ava+gardner+democrat&amp;pg=PA249|title=Ava Gardner: &quot;Love Is Nothing&quot; |first=Lee |last=Server |date=15 May 2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780312312107 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBk9DQAAQBAJ&amp;q=ava+gardner+democrat&amp;pg=PT254 |title=Ava Gardner: A Life in Movies |first1=Kendra |last1=Bean |first2=Anthony |last2=Uzarowski |date=11 July 2017 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=9780762460434 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bout of [[pneumonia]], after a lifetime of smoking, coupled with her underlying condition of [[Lupus erythematosus]] brought on a [[stroke]] in 1986 that left Gardner partially paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra: Biggest Bombshells from New Biography|url=https://people.com/celebrity/biggest-bombshells-from-new-ava-gardner-biography-her-tumultuous-marriage-to-frank-sinatra-more/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Server|first=Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=enskE0KWMQ4C&amp;q=ava+gardner+lupus&amp;pg=PA490|title=Ava Gardner: &quot;Love Is Nothing&quot;|date=2007-05-15|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-31210-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she could afford her medical expenses, Sinatra wanted to pay for her visit to a specialist in the United States, and she allowed him to make the arrangements for a medically staffed private plane. She died in January 1990, at the age of 67 of pneumonia and [[fibrosing alveolitis]] at her London home 34 [[Kingston House estate, London|Ennismore Gardens]], where she had lived since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;https://findadeath.com/wp-content/uploads/directory/a/Ava_Gardner/DC.jpg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner was buried in the Sunset Memorial Park, [[Smithfield, North Carolina]], next to her siblings and their parents, Jonas and Molly Gardner. In the town of Smithfield there is the [[Ava Gardner Museum]] incorporated in 1996.

In the last years of her life, Gardner asked Peter Evans to ghostwrite her autobiography, stating, &quot;I either write the book or sell the jewels.&quot; Despite meeting with Evans frequently, and approving of most of his copy, Gardner eventually learned that Evans, along with the BBC, had once been sued by her ex-husband Frank Sinatra. Gardner and Evans's friendship subsequently cooled, and Evans left the project. Evans' notes and sections of his draft of Gardner's autobiography, which he based on their taped conversations, were published in the book ''Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations'' after Evans' death in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Peter and Garner, Ava.

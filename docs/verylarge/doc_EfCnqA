Marking the festival's importance, in several denominations, such as the Lutheran, Episcopal, and [[United Methodist]] churches, and formerly in the Roman Catholic Church, all the Sundays from the holiday itself until [[Advent]] in late November or December are designated the 2nd, 3rd, Nth, Sunday after Pentecost, etc. Throughout the year, in Roman Catholic piety, Pentecost is the third of the [[Glorious Mysteries]] of the [[Rosary|Holy Rosary]], as well as being one of the [[Stations of the Resurrection]] or Via Lucis.

In some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, where there is less emphasis on the [[liturgical year]], Pentecost may still be one of the greatest celebrations in the year, such as in [[Germany]] or [[Romania]]. In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, [[Mother's Day]], may be more celebrated than the ancient and biblical feast of Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchyear.net/pentecost.html |title=Pentecost: All About Pentecost (Whitsunday)! |publisher=ChurchYear.net |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]].{{clarify|Note that this says just the opposite of the first sentence|date=December 2012}}

Across denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Church in an [[ecumenical]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themint.org.uk/yPhoto086_PentecostPicnic2009.html |title=Pentecost Picnic 2009 |publisher=Themint.org.uk |accessdate=2010-05-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monashcatholics.blogspot.com/2007/06/photos-of-ecumenical-pentecost.html |title=Catholics at Monash: Photos of Ecumenical Pentecost Celebrations |publisher=MonashCatholics.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mariology ==
A secular iconography in the Western and in the Eastern Churches reflect the belief of the presence of the Blessed Virgin Mary in day of Pentecost and her central role on the divine concession of the gift of the Holy Spirit God to the Apostles.
{{bibleverse|Acts|1.12}} confirms the presence of the mother of Jesus with the Twelve in a spiritual communion of daily prayer. It is the unique reference to the Mother of God after Jesus' entrusting to St. John the Evangelist and the Apostle at the feet of the cross, an episode known as ''[[Ecce homo]]''.

According to that iconographic tradition, the Latin encyclical ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' officially stated: 
{{quote
|She it was through her powerful prayers obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer, already given on the Cross, should be bestowed, accompanied by miraculous gifts, on the newly founded Church at Pentecost; and finally, bearing with courage and confidence the tremendous burden of her sorrows and desolation, she, truly the Queen of Martyrs, more than all the faithful &quot;filled up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ...for His Body, which is the Church&quot;; and she continues to have for the Mystical Body of Christ, born of the pierced Heart of the Savior, the same motherly care and ardent love with which she cherished and fed the Infant Jesus in the crib.
|author= [[Pope Pius XII]]
|title= Mystici Corporis Christi, 2 March 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Pope Pius XII | url = http://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi.html | title = Encyclical &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot; | date = March 2, 1943 | website = Holy See | publisher = [[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Church recognize to the Mother of God a special form of veneration called with the Greek word ''[[Veneration#Catholicism and Orthodoxy|hyperdulia]]''. It corresponds to a special power of [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] that the prayers dedicated to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary have in respect of any other saint praying God in favour of His sons and believers. The Pope stated that Mary prayed God and her prayer of intercession was capable to persuade God to send His Holy Spirit as a permanent gift for the Twelve and their successors forming the Apostolic Church.

In a similar way, Pope John Paul II in the general audience held in Vatican on May 28, 1997, affirmed:
{{quote|Retracing the course of the Virgin Mary’s life, the Second Vatican Council recalls her presence in the community waiting for Pentecost. “But since it had pleased God not to manifest solemnly the mystery of the salvation of the human race before he would pour forth the Spirit promised by Christ, we see the Apostles before the day of Pentecost ‘persevering with one mind in prayer with the women and Mary the Mother of Jesus, and with his brethren’ (Acts 1:14), and we also see Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the Spirit, who had already overshadowed her in the Annunciation” ([[Lumen gentium]], n.59). The first community is the prelude to the birth of the Church; the Blessed Virgin’s presence helps to sketch her definitive features, a fruit of the gift of Pentecost. [...]
In contemplating Mary’s powerful intercession as she waits for the Holy Spirit, Christians of every age have frequently had recourse to her intercession on the long and tiring journey to salvation, in order to receive the gifts of the Paraclete in greater abundance. [...]
In the Church and for the Church, mindful of Jesus’ promise, she waits for Pentecost and implores a multiplicity of gifts for everyone, in accordance with each one's personality and mission.|Pope John Paul II, ''General Audience'', 28 May 1997, Rome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/it/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_28051997.html | title = General audience of Wednestay 28 May 1997 | publisher = [[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]] | website = Holy See | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200830120535/http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_28051997.html | archive-date = August 30, 2020 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Marian intercessory prayer is dated to the day before the Pentecost, while it isn't explicitly stated her presence with the Apostles in the day of the Solemnity, in consideration of that she was called &quot;full of grace&quot; of the Holy Spirit God since the time of the [[Annunciation]].

== Music ==
[[List of hymns for Pentecost|Several hymns were written and composed for Pentecost]], notably [[Veni Creator Spiritus]] (Come, Creator Spirit), attributed to the 9th-century [[Rabanus Maurus]], and translated throughout the centuries in different languages. This one and some more are suitable also for other occasions imploring the Holy Spirit, such as [[Ordination in the Catholic Church|ordinations]] and coronations.

=== Classical compositions ===
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church of the [[Baroque]] observed three days of Pentecost. Some composers wrote sacred [[cantata]]s to be performed in the church services of these days. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed several [[Bach cantata|cantatas]] for [[Church cantata#Pentecost|Pentecost]], including [[Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172|''Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!'' BWV 172]], in 1714 and [[Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, BWV 68|''Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt'', BWV 68]], in 1725. [[Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel]] wrote cantatas such as ''Werdet voll Geistes'' (Get full of spirit) in 1737.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/May05/Stolzel_9998762.htm Cantatas for Pentecost] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165554/http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/May05/Stolzel_9998762.htm |date=2011-06-29 }} review of the 2002 recording by Johan van Veen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart composed an antiphon ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus (Mozart)|Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'' in 1768.

[[Olivier Messiaen]] composed an organ mass ''[[Messe de la Pentecôte]]'' in 1949/50. In 1964 [[Fritz Werner]] wrote an [[oratorio]] for Pentecost ''Veni, sancte spiritus'' (Come, Holy Spirit) on the sequence ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'', and [[Jani Christou]] wrote ''Tongues of Fire'', a Pentecost oratorio. [[Richard Hillert]] wrote a ''Motet for the Day of Pentecost'' for choir, vibraphone, and prepared electronic tape in 1969. [[Violeta Dinescu]] composed ''Pfingstoratorium'', an oratorio for Pentecost for five soloists, mixed chorus and small orchestra in 1993. Daniel Elder's 21st century piece, &quot;Factus est Repente&quot;, for a cappella choir, was premiered in 2013.

== Customs and traditions ==
In [[Italy]] it was customary to scatter [[rose]] petals from the ceiling of the churches to recall the miracle of the fiery tongues; hence in [[Sicily]] and elsewhere in Italy Whitsunday is called ''Pasqua rosatum''. The [[Italian language|Italian]] name ''Pasqua rossa'' comes from the red colours of the vestments used on Whitsunday.&lt;ref name=Kellner&gt;[https://archive.org/details/heortologyhistor00kelluoft/page/115 &lt;!-- quote=Pasqua rossa. --&gt; Kellner, Karl Adam Heinrich. ''Heortology: A History of the Christian Festivals from Their Origin to the Present Day'', K. Paul, 1908, p. 115] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]] it was customary to blow [[trumpet]]s during Divine service, to recall the sound of the mighty wind which accompanied the Descent of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Kellner /&gt;

In the north west of [[England]], church and chapel parades called Whit Walks take place at Whitsun (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitfriday.brassbands.saddleworth.org/Walks.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141436/http://www.whitfriday.brassbands.saddleworth.org/Walks.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-09 |title=Whit Friday: Whit Walks |publisher=Whitfriday.brassbands.saddleworth.org |date=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the parades contain brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit Fairs (sometimes called Whitsun Ales)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feastsandfestivals.blogspot.com/2010/05/23-may-whitsun-ales.html |title='Feasts and Festivals': 23 May: Whitsun Ales |publisher=Feastsandfestivals.blogspot.com |date=2010-05-23 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place.

(The Book of Common Prayer only once uses the word &quot;Pentecost&quot; for the festival. Though some{{who|date=May 2015}} think that name derives from white clothes worn by newly baptised in Eastertide, it may well be seen as derived from &quot;wit&quot;, hence &quot;wisdom&quot;, the reference being to Holy Wisdom (Sancta Sophia, Hagia Sophia), referred to in Proverbs and the Book of Wisdom, with which the Holy Spirit has often been identified.

In [[Finland]] there is a saying known virtually by everyone which translates as &quot;if one has no sweetheart until Pentecost, he/she will not have it during the whole summer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trinityinthevalley.com/trinity-lutheran-blog/2018/8/2/did-you-ever-wonder-about-famous-lutherans-k55z5-brh87-bsmjr-648cc-3fkpl-gml4n|title=Did You Ever Wonder... about Pentecost Traditions?|website=Trinity Lutheran Church|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Port Vila]], the capital of [[Vanuatu]], people originating from [[Pentecost Island]] usually celebrate their island's name-day with a special church service followed by cultural events such as dancing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In [[Ukraine]] the springtime feast day of  ''Zeleni Sviata'' became associated with the Pentecost. (The exact origin of the relationship is not known). The customs for the festival were performed in the following order: first, home and [[hearth]] would be cleaned; second, foods were prepared for the festival; finally, homes and churches were decorated with wildflowers and various types of green [[herbs]] and plants. A seven course meal may have been served as the Pentecost feast which may have included traditional dishes such as [[cereal]] with [[honey]] (''kolyvo''), [[rice]] or [[millet]] grains with [[milk]], [[sauerkraut]] soup (''kapusniak''), chicken broth with handmade [[noodle]]s (''iushka z zaterkoiu''), cheese turnovers (''pyrizhky  syrom''), roast pork, [[buckwheat]] cakes served with [[egg as food|eggs]] and [[cheese]] (''blyntsi''), and baked [[kasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press| isbn = 978-0-8229-3646-6| pages = 78–84| last = Farley| first = Marta Pisetska| title = Festive Ukrainian Cooking| journal = Festive Ukrainian Cooking| chapter = Pentecost| date = 1990| jstor = j.ctt7zwbs9.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date and public holiday ==
The earliest possible date is May 10 (as in 1818 and 2285). The latest possible date is June 13 (as in 1943 and 2038). The day of Pentecost is seven weeks after Easter Sunday: that is to say, the fiftieth day after Easter inclusive of Easter Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Pentecost |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2017-06-03 |quote=Pentecost... major festival in the Christian church, celebrated on the Sunday that falls on the 50th day after Easter. |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pentecost-Christianity |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711211938/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pentecost-Christianity |archivedate=2017-07-11 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentecost may also refer to the 50 days from Easter to Pentecost Sunday inclusive of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 |editor1=Kazhdan Alexander P |last=Taft |first=Robert |title=Pentecost |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium |accessdate=2017-06-07 |year=2005 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195046526.001.0001/acref-9780195046526-e-4212 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810071131/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195046526.001.0001/acref-9780195046526-e-4212 |archivedate=2017-08-10 |url-status=live |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195046526.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Easter itself has no fixed date, this makes Pentecost a moveable feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Grassie |first=William |title=Easter: A Moveable Feast |work=HuffPost |accessdate=2017-06-04 |date=2013-03-28 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-grassie/easter-a-moveable-feast_b_2970557.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413072123/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-grassie/easter-a-moveable-feast_b_2970557.html |archive-date=2017-04-13 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Eastern Christianity treats Pentecost as the last day of Easter in its liturgies, in the [[Roman liturgy]] it is usually a separate feast.&lt;ref name=liturgy /&gt; The fifty days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday may also be called [[Eastertide]].&lt;ref name=liturgy&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-25350-9 |author=Presbyterian Church (US)|title=Liturgical Year: The Worship of God |date=1992}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Pentecost itself is on a Sunday, it is automatically considered to be a public holiday in countries with large Christian denominations.

Pentecost Monday is a public holiday in many countries including [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Benin]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Romania]] (since 2008), [[Senegal]], (most parts of) [[Switzerland]], [[Togo]] and [[Ukraine]].

In [[Sweden]] it was also a public holiday, but Pentecost Monday (Annandag Pingst) was replaced by Swedish National Day on June 6, by a government decision on December 15, 2004. In [[Italy]] and [[Malta]], it is no longer a public holiday. It was a public holiday in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] until 1973, when it was replaced by Early Summer Holiday on the first Monday in June. In the [[United Kingdom]] the day is known as [[Whit Monday]], and was a [[bank holiday]] until 1967 when it was replaced by the Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. In France, following reactions to the implementation of the ''[[Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées]]'', Pentecost Monday has been reestablished as a regular (not as a ''working'') holiday on May 3, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0521.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528070056/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0521.shtml |archivedate=2009-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary allusions ==
According to legend, [[King Arthur]] always gathered all his knights at the round table for a feast and a quest on Pentecost:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So ever the king had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year, he would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great marvel.
&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Thomas Malory. [http://www.arthurian-legend.com/le-morte-darthur/le-morte-darthur-7.php Book 7, chapter 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119060020/http://www.arthurian-legend.com/le-morte-darthur/le-morte-darthur-7.php |date=2010-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] declared Pentecost &quot;das liebliche Fest&quot; – the lovely Feast, in a selection by the same name in his ''[[Reineke Fuchs]]''.

:Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest, war gekommen;
:es grünten und blühten Feld und Wald;
:auf Hügeln und Höhn, in Büschen und Hecken
:Übten ein fröhliches Lied die neuermunterten Vögel;
:Jede Wiese sprosste von Blumen in duftenden Gründen,
:Festlich heiter glänzte der Himmel und farbig die Erde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gedichte-fuer-alle-faelle.de/allegedichte/gedicht_476.html |title=Das Gedicht Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest... von Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |website=gedichte-fuer-alle-faelle.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest&quot;, speaks of Pentecost as a time of greening and blooming in fields, woods, hills, mountains, bushes and hedges, of birds singing new songs, meadows sprouting fragrant flowers, and of festive sunshine gleaming from the skies and coloring the earth – iconic lines idealizing the Pentecost holidays in the German-speaking lands.

Further, Goethe records an old peasant proverb relating to Pentecost in his &quot;Sankt-Rochus-Fest zu Bingen&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/index.php?id=5&amp;xid=898&amp;kapitel=8&amp;cHash=b151364af22#gb_found |title=Nachrichten – Kultur |publisher=Projekt Gutenberg.spiegel.de |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
– ''Ripe strawberries at Pentecost mean a good wine crop.''

[[Alexandre Dumas, père]] mentions of Pentecost in ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' (French: Vingt ans après), the sequel to ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. A meal is planned for the holiday, to which La Ramée, second in command of the prison, is invited, and by which contrivance, the Duke is able to escape. He speaks sarcastically of the festival to his jailor, foreshadowing his escape : ''&quot;Now, what has Pentecost to do with me? Do you fear, say, that the Holy Ghost may come down in the form of fiery tongues and open the gates of my prison?&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/index.php?id=5&amp;xid=486&amp;kapitel=12&amp;cHash=1&amp;hilite=Pfingsten#gb_found |title=Nachrichten – Kultur |publisher=Projekt Gutenberg.spiegel.de |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] mentions Pentecost in a line from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' Act 1, Scene V. At the ball at his home, Capulet speaks in refuting an overestimate of the time elapsed since he last danced: ''&quot;What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much! 'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/romeo-and-juliet-text/act-i-scene-v |title=Romeo and Juliet Text and Translation – Act I, Scene V |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note here the allusion to the tradition of [[mumming]], [[Morris dancing]] and wedding celebrations at Pentecost.

'''Whatì''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɒ|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = Tłı̨chǫ Agreement|place = Ottawa|publisher = Queen's Printer for Canada|year = 2003|url = https://www.tlicho.ca/sites/default/files/documents/government/T%C5%82%C4%B1%CC%A8cho%CC%A8%20Agreement%20-%20English.pdf|isbn = 0662349717}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Dogrib language]] meaning &quot;Marten Lakes&quot;), officially the ''Tłı̨chǫ Community Government of Whatì''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maca.gov.nt.ca/resources/Differences_in_Comm_Govt_Structure.pdf Differences in Community Government Structures]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[First Nations]] community in the [[North Slave Region]] of the [[Northwest Territories]], Canada. Whatì is located by [[Lac La Martre]], about {{Convert|164|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the territorial capital of [[Yellowknife]].

==History==
With rich and varied wildlife, the area has long been a favoured hunting ground of the [[Tłı̨chǫ]] (Dogrib [[Dene]]) [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous people]]. The [[North West Company]] established a [[trading post]] there in 1793, and many natives began settling there permanently, while they continued to hunt and fish in the area. With the establishment of a trading post at [[Behchokǫ̀|Fort Rae]] on [[Great Slave Lake]] in the late 19th century, most regional trading was accomplished at the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and free traders posts there. A trading post at Lac La Martre was not again established until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''Free Traders in Northland Start Again'', The Edmonton Bulletin, May 6, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1996, the community officially changed its name from Lac La Martre to the Tłı̨chǫ name &quot;Wha Ti&quot;, meaning &quot;Marten Lake,&quot; the same meaning as the French and then on 4 August 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;pwhc&quot;/&gt; to the current spelling. Other traditional Tłı̨chǫ names for the settlement include Tsoti{{Pronunciation-needed}} ('fouled water lake') and Mine Go Kola{{Pronunciation-needed}} ('net fishing with houses').&lt;ref name=&quot;pwhc&quot;/&gt;

Before 2005, the community was unincorporated, and local governance was provided by a First Nations [[band government]], [[Wha Ti First Nation]]. Under the terms of the Tłı̨chǫ Agreement, most responsibilities of Wha Ti have been transferred to a new Whatì Community Government. However, the First Nation is still recognized by the federal government for [[Indian Act]] enrollment.

==Demographics==
At the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 Census]] the population was 470, a decrease of 4.5% over the [[2011 Canadian Census|2011 Census]]. The majority of the population is Indigenous of which 445 were [[First Nations]] and 10 were [[Métis in Canada|Métis]]. The main languages were [[Dogrib language|Dogrib]] and English with a few [[Slavey language|North Slavey]] speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016census&quot;&gt;[https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=6103034&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=61&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=What%C3%AC&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=6103034&amp;TABID=1 Census Profile, 2016 Census Whatì, Community government (Census subdivision), Northwest Territories and Northwest Territories (Territory)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 522 with an average yearly growth rate of 0.6% from 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;comstat&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
While trapping, hunting, and fishing continue to be the main economic activities in this traditional community, efforts have been made to develop tourism as well. A fishing lodge was opened, and many tourists come to see the abundant wildlife, including [[American black bear|black bears]], [[barren-ground caribou]], [[wolf|wolves]], and [[eagle]]s. The community takes special pride in the fact that no [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] is allowed there.

}}

The '''Compromise of 1850''' was a package of five separate bills passed by the [[United States Congress]] in September 1850 that defused a political confrontation between [[slave and free states]] on the status of [[Mexican Cession|territories acquired]] in the [[Mexican–American War]]. It also set [[Texas]]'s western and northern borders and included provisions addressing [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] and the slave trade. The compromise was brokered by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] senator [[Henry Clay]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Stephen Douglas]] with the support of President [[Millard Fillmore]].

Mackerel are prolific [[broadcast spawner]]s, and must breed near the surface of the water because the eggs of the females float. Individual females lay between 300,000 and 1,500,000 eggs.&lt;ref name=FAOTuna /&gt; Their [[Fish egg|eggs]] and [[Fish larvae|larvae]] are [[pelagic]], that is, they float free in the open sea. The larvae and juvenile mackerel feed on [[zooplankton]]. As adults, they have sharp teeth, and hunt small crustaceans such as [[copepod]]s, [[forage fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[squid]]. In turn, they are hunted by larger pelagic animals such as tuna, [[billfish]], sea lions, [[shark]]s, and [[pelican]]s.&lt;ref name=FAOjaponicus /&gt;&lt;ref name=FAOcavalla /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forage species | url = http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/4290/en | publisher = [[FAO]] | access-date = 2019-05-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041523/http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/4290/en | archive-date = 2018-12-21 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chub mackerel, ''Scomber japonicus'', are the most intensively fished scombroid mackerel. They account for about half the total capture production of scombroid mackerels.&lt;ref name=FAOdata /&gt; As a species, they are easily confused with Atlantic mackerel. Chub mackerel migrate long distances in oceans and across the Mediterranean. They can be caught with [[drift net]]s and suitable [[trawl]]s, but are most usually caught with [[surround net]]s at night by attracting them with lampara lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chub mackerel | url = http://www.sicilianfishontheroad.com/en/il-pescato-siciliano/il-pesce-azzurro/lanzardo | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130313192422/http://www.sicilianfishontheroad.com/en/il-pescato-siciliano/il-pesce-azzurro/lanzardo | archive-date = 2013-03-13 | url-status = dead | publisher = Sicilian Fish on the Road | access-date = 2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining catch of scombroid mackerels is divided equally between the Atlantic mackerel and all other scombroid mackerels. Just two species account for about 75% of the total catch of scombroid mackerels.&lt;ref name=FAOdata /&gt;

Chilean jack mackerel are the most commonly fished nonscombroid mackerel, fished as heavily as chub mackerel.&lt;ref name=FAOdata /&gt;&lt;ref name=FAOmurphyi /&gt;  The species has been [[Overfishing|overfished]], and its fishery may now be in danger of collapsing.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;

Smaller mackerel behave like [[herring]]s, and are captured in similar ways.&lt;ref name=Clapham1941 /&gt; Fish species like these, which [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] near the surface, can be caught efficiently by purse seining. Huge purse-seine vessels use spotter planes to locate the schooling fish. Then they close in using sophisticated sonar to track the shape of the school, which is then encircled with fast auxiliary boats that deploy purse seines as they speed around the school.&lt;ref&gt;

Suitably designed [[Trolling (fishing)|trollers]] can also catch mackerels effectively when they swim near the surface.

==Management==
The [[North Sea]] has been overfished to the point where the ecological balance has become disrupted and many jobs in the fishing industry have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Clover | first1 = Charles | year = 2004 | title = The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat | location = London | publisher = Ebury Press | isbn = 0-09-189780-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southeast US region spans the [[Gulf of Mexico]],  the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the US Southeast Atlantic. Overfishing of [[king mackerel|king]] and [[Atlantic Spanish mackerel|Spanish mackerel]] occurred in the 1980s. Regulations were introduced to restrict the size,  fishing locations, and bag limits for recreational fishers and commercial fishers. [[Gillnet]]s were banned in waters off Florida. By 2001, the mackerel stocks had bounced back.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = FISHERY COUNTRY PROFILE: THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA | url = ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_US.pdf | publisher = [[FAO]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170518220246/ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_US.pdf | archive-date = 2017-05-18 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackerel is an important [[food fish]] that is consumed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The California mackerel fishery | last1 = Croker | first1 = Richard Symonds | year = 1933 | url = http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt758005bw&amp;query=&amp;brand=calisphere | publisher = Division of Fish and Game of California | number = Contribution No. 125 from the California State Fisheries Laboratory | pages = 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[oily fish]], it is a rich source of [[omega-3 fatty acids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.jerseyseafood.nj.gov/nutrition.html | title = Jersey Seafood Nutrition and Health | publisher = State of New Jersey Department of Agriculture | access-date = 2012-04-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170701033752/http://www.jerseyseafood.nj.gov/nutrition.html | archive-date = 2017-07-01 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flesh of mackerel spoils quickly, especially in the tropics, and can cause [[scombroid food poisoning]]. Accordingly, it should be eaten on the day of capture, unless properly refrigerated or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = November 2007 | title = Scombrotoxin (Histamine) | url = http://www.foodsafetywatch.com/public/484.cfm | url-status = dead | publisher = Food Safety Watch | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120713020029/http://www.foodsafetywatch.com/public/484.cfm | archive-date = 2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackerel preservation is not simple. Before the 19th-century development of canning and the widespread availability of refrigeration, salting and smoking were the principal preservation methods available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp | Croker | 1933 | pp = 104-105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically in England, this fish was not preserved, but was consumed only in its fresh form. However, spoilage was common, leading the authors of ''The Cambridge Economic History of Europe'' to remark: &quot;There are more references to stinking mackerel in English literature than to any other fish!&quot;&lt;ref name=Clapham1941 /&gt; In France, mackerel was traditionally pickled with large amounts of salt, which allowed it to be sold widely across the country.&lt;ref name=Clapham1941&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Clapham | first1 = JH | last2 = Postan | first2 = MM | last3 = Rich | first3 = EE | year = 1941 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gBw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Mackerel+fisheries%22+history&amp;pg=PA166 | title = The Cambridge economic history of Europe | publisher = CUP Archive | pages = 166–168 | isbn = 978-0-521-08710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a marine [[pelagic fish]] found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean.  Bluefish are known as '''tailor''' in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.csiro.au/caabsearch/caab_search.caab_report?spcode=37334002 CAAB taxon report for Pomatomus saltatrix] at the [[CSIRO]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''elf''' and '''shad''' in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4H1uWszXOQC&amp;q=other+names+for+bluefish+in+north+america+elf&amp;pg=PA188|title=Coastal Fishes of Southern Africa|last1=Heemstra|first1=Phillip C.|last2=Heemstra|first2=Elaine|date=2004|publisher=NISC (PTY) LTD|isbn=9781920033019|location=|pages=187–188|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a popular [[gamefish]] and [[fish as food|food fish]].

The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail. The spiny first [[dorsal fin]] is normally folded back in a groove, as are its [[pectoral fin]]s. Coloration is a grayish blue-green dorsally, fading to white on the lower sides and belly. Its single row of teeth in each jaw is uniform in size, knife-edged, and sharp. Bluefish commonly range in size from seven-inch (18-cm) &quot;snappers&quot; to much larger, sometimes weighing as much as 40&amp;nbsp;lb (18&amp;nbsp;kg), though fish heavier than 20&amp;nbsp;lb (9&amp;nbsp;kg) are exceptional.

== Systematics ==
The bluefish is the only extant species now included in the family Pomatomidae. At one time, [[gnomefish]]es were included, but these are now grouped in a separate family, [[Scombropidae]].  One extinct relative of the bluefish is ''[[Lophar miocaenus]]'', from the Late [[Miocene]] of Southern California.

== Distribution ==
[[File:Trolling for bluefish2.jpg|thumb|''Trolling for blue fish'' [[lithograph]] by [[Currier &amp; Ives]], 1866]]

Bluefish are widely distributed around the world in tropical and subtropical waters. They are found in [[pelagic]] waters on much of the continental shelves along eastern America (though not between south Florida and northern South America), Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas (and during migration in between), Southeast Asia, and Australia. They are found in a variety of coastal habitats: above the continental shelf, in energetic waters near surf beaches, or by rock headlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/tm/tm144/tm144.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They also enter [[estuaries]] and inhabit [[brackish]] waters.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, R.

Retrieved October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the U.S. East Coast, bluefish are found off [[Florida]] in the winter. By April, they have disappeared, heading north. By June, they may be found off [[Massachusetts]]; in years of high abundance, stragglers may be found as far north as [[Nova Scotia]]. By October, they leave the waters north of New York City, heading south (whereas some bluefish, perhaps less migratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sms.si.edu/irlspec/pomatom_saltat.htm|title= Pomatomus saltatrix (Bluefish) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://combat-fishing.com/fishencyclo1/bluefishes/bluefish.htm|title= Common Name: Bluefish}}&lt;/ref&gt; are present in the Gulf of Mexico throughout the year). In a similar pattern overall, the economically significant population that spawns in Europe's Black Sea migrates south through Istanbul (Bosphorus, Sea of Marmara, Dardanelles, Aegean Sea) and on toward Turkey's Mediterranean coast in the autumn for the cold season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.slowfood.com/slowfish/pagine/eng/pagina.lasso?-id_pg=199|title=  Saving the Sultan of Fish|access-date=  2012-11-02|archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20111127013552/http://www.slowfood.com/slowfish/pagine/eng/pagina.lasso?-id_pg=199|archive-date=  2011-11-27|url-status=  dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the South African coast and environs, movement patterns are roughly in parallel.&lt;ref name=mosselbaai&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://mosselbaai.wordpress.com/2012/05/13/pomatomus-saltatrix-shad-or-elf/|title= Pomatomus Saltatrix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life history ==
Adult bluefish are typically between 20 and 60&amp;nbsp;cm ({{nowrap|8&amp;nbsp;in. to 2&amp;nbsp;ft.)}} long, with a maximum reported size of 120&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft.) and {{cvt|14|kg|lb}}. They reproduce during spring and summer, and can live up to 9 years.&lt;ref name=Fishbase/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt; Bluefish [[Spawn (biology)|fry]] are [[zooplankton]], and are largely at the mercy of currents.&lt;ref&gt;Norcross, J. J., Richardson, S. L., Massmann, W. H., Joseph, E. B. 1974. Development of young bluefish ''Pomatomus saltatrix'' and distribution of eggs and young in Virginian coastal waters. Trans. Am. Fish.

F. 1993. http://www.galvestonlab.sefsc.noaa.gov/publications/pdf/832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Spent bluefish have been found off east-central Florida, migrating north. As with most marine fish, their spawning habits are not well known. In the western side of the North Atlantic, at least two populations occur, separated by [[Cape Hatteras]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[Gulf Stream]] can carry fry spawned to the south of Cape Hatteras to the north, and eddies can spin off, carrying them into populations found off the coast of the mid-Atlantic, and the [[New England]] states.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, A. W., Jr., Walford, L. A. 1979. Sources and distribution of bluefish, ''Pomatomus saltatrix'', larvae and juveniles off the east coast of the United States.

}}

Adult bluefish are strong and aggressive, and live in loose groups. They are fast swimmers that prey on [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] of [[forage fish]], and continue attacking them in [[Feeding frenzy|feeding frenzies]] even after they appear to have eaten their fill.&lt;ref name=Fishbase /&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt; Depending on area and season, they favor [[menhaden]] and other [[sardine]]-like fish ([[Clupeidae]]), jacks ([[Scombridae]]), [[weakfish]] ([[Sciaenidae]]), grunts ([[Haemulidae]]), striped anchovies ([[Engraulidae]]), [[shrimp]], and [[squid]]. They are [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic]] and can destroy their own young.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;Schultz, Ken (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R4aA5QZqj5kC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Bluefish+cannibalistic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pbpH89MivM&amp;sig=WYnTHJiV5NXUHumicygPmwgqFTU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gsJoUKGaIJCPiAfR1oHIDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Bluefish%20cannibalistic&amp;f=false ''Ken Schultz's Essentials of Fishing''] John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9780470444313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluefish sometimes chase bait through the [[surf zone]], attacking schools in very shallow water, churning the water like a washing machine. This behavior is sometimes referred to as a &quot;bluefish blitz&quot;.

In turn, bluefish are preyed upon by larger predators at all stages of their lifecycle.  As juveniles, they fall victim to a wide variety of oceanic predators, including striped bass, larger bluefish, fluke (summer flounder), weakfish, tuna, sharks, rays, and dolphins.  As adults, bluefish are taken by tuna, sharks, billfish, seals, sea lions, dolphins, porpoises, and many other species.

Bluefish are aggressive and have been known to inflict severe bites on fishermen. Wading or swimming among feeding bluefish schools can be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Lovko, Vincent J. (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ymQlrOJLCN4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Pfiesteria+piscicida%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6DPcCIqhcO&amp;sig=qfgrf7GVPJ6jwpI96iLTjrXVB8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YwtsUOXVF8eQiAe84IDgAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pfiesteria%20piscicida%22&amp;f=false ''Pathogenicity of the Purportedly Toxic Dinoflagellates Pfiesteria Piscicida and Pseudopfiesteria Shumwayae and Related Species''] ProQuest. {{ISBN|9780549882640}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, a seven-year-old girl was attacked on a beach, near the Spanish town of [[Alicante]], allegedly by a bluefish. In New Jersey, the large beachfeeder schools are very common and lifeguards report never having seen bluefish bite bathers in their entire careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/depredador/rapido/voraz/dientes/sierra/elpporesp/20060714elpepunac_9/Tes &quot;Un depredador rápido y muy voraz con dientes de sierra (in Spanish)&quot;] ''El País'', July 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parasites ==
[[File:Parasite170008-fig1 - Ovary of fish with visible Philometra females.png|thumb|Ovary of fish with visible ''Philometra'' females - lower row: bluefish]]
As other fish, bluefish host a number of [[Fish diseases and parasites|parasites]]. One spectacular parasite is ''Philometra saltatrix'', a [[Philometra|philometrid]] [[nematode]] in the ovaries. The females are brownish red and may be as long as 80&amp;nbsp;mm; the males are very small.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoravecChaabane2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moravec|first1=František|last2=Chaabane|first2=Amira|last3=Neifar|first3=Lassad|last4=Gey|first4=Delphine|last5=Justine|first5=Jean-Lou|title=Species of ''Philometra'' (Nematoda, Philometridae) from fishes off the Mediterranean coast of Africa, with a description of ''Philometra rara'' n. sp. from ''Hyporthodus haifensis'' and a molecular analysis of ''Philometra saltatrix'' from ''Pomatomus saltatrix''|journal=Parasite|volume=24|year=2017|pages=8|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2017008|pmid=28287390|pmc=5364780|url=http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2017/01/parasite170008/parasite170008.html}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreational fisheries==
In Australia, bluefish, called &quot;tailor&quot;, are caught on the west coast from Exmouth to Albany, with the most productive fishing areas being in the west coast bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tailor recreational fishing |url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/Species/Tailor/Pages/Tailor-Recreational-Fishing.aspx |website=fish.wa.au |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., bluefish are landed primarily in recreational fisheries, but important commercial fisheries also exist in temperate and subtropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/sos/spsyn/op/bluefish/|title= Bluefish_ Status of Fishery Resources off the Northeastern US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bluefish population abundance is typically cyclical, with abundance varying widely over a span of 10 years or more.&lt;ref name=Ulanski&gt;Ulanski, Stan (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fNqu1nrQbyoC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Bluefish+cannibalistic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jdgrk__3o&amp;sig=diGbexjGlTutRc6eSXR-r6RUDoU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gsJoUKGaIJCPiAfR1oHIDw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bluefish%20cannibalistic&amp;f=false ''Fishing North Carolina's Outer Banks''] University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|9780807872079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Bluefish is a popular sport and food fish, and has been widely overfished.&lt;ref&gt;http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/3/531.full&lt;/ref&gt; Fisheries management has generally stabilized its population. In the middle Atlantic region of the U.S., bluefish were [[Overfishing|heavily overfished]] in the late 1990s, but active management rebuilt the [[fish stock|stock]] by 2007.&lt;ref name=FishWatch&gt;[http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/bluefish/species_pages/bluefish.htm Bluefish] ''FishWatch'', NOAA. Retrieved 5 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere, public awareness efforts, such as bluefish festivals, combined with catch limits, may be having positive effects in reducing the stress on the regional stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/istanbul-celebrates-new-hope-for-a-favorite-fish-with-first-annual-la14fer-festival.html|title= Istanbul Celebrates New Hope for a Favorite Fish With First-Annual 'Lüfer Festival'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As food==
Bluefish may be baked or poached,&lt;ref name=&quot;admed&quot;&gt;Alan Davidson, ''Mediterranean Seafood'', 3rd edition, 2002, {{isbn|1580084516}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; or smoked.&lt;ref name=&quot;mkt&quot;/&gt; The smaller ones (&quot;snapper blues&quot;) are generally fried, as they are not very oily.&lt;ref name=&quot;adatl&quot;&gt;Alan Davidson, ''North Atlantic Seafood'', 1980, {{isbn|0670515248}}, p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its fattiness, bluefish goes rancid rapidly, so it is generally not found far from its fisheries,&lt;ref name=&quot;mkt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Fish Market: A Cookbook for Selecting and Preparing Seafood|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; but where it is available, it is often inexpensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;sifton&quot;&gt;[https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014240-smoked-bluefish-pate Sam Sifton, &quot;Smoked Bluefish Pâté&quot;, ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; It must be refrigerated and consumed soon after purchase; some recipes call for keeping it in vinegar and wine before cooking, in ''vina d'alhos''&lt;ref name=&quot;adatl&quot;/&gt; or ''[[en escabeche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5915-bluefish-escabeche Florence Fabricant, &quot;Bluefish Escabeche&quot;, ''New York Times'' Cooking]&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, it is high in [[omega-3 fatty acids]], but also in [[mercury in fish|mercury]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mkt&quot;/&gt; containing the high level of about 0.4 ppm of mercury on average,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.12.034 |title=Mercury and selenium levels in 19 species of saltwater fish from New Jersey as a function of species, size, and season |journal=Science of the Total Environment|year=2011 |last1=Burger |first1=Joanna |last2=Gochfeld |first2=Michael |volume=409 |issue=8 |pages=1418–1429 |pmid=21292311 |pmc=4300121 |bibcode=2011ScTEn.409.1418B }}&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to [[albacore tuna]] or [[Spanish mackerel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/metals/ucm115644.htm |title=Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish (1990-2012) |website=FDA |access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, the U.S. [[FDA]] recommends that young children and women of childbearing age consume no more than one serving per week (a serving size is about 4 ounces uncooked for an adult, 2 ounces for children ages 4–7 years, 3 ounces for children ages 8–10 years, and 4 ounces for children 11 years and older).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, &quot;Eating Fish: What Pregnant Women and Parents Should Know&quot; [https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm393070.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catfish''' (or '''catfishes'''; [[order (biology)|order]] '''Siluriformes''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|lj|ʊər|ᵻ|f|ɔːr|m|iː|z}} or '''Nematognathi''') are a diverse group of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned]] [[fish]]. Named for their prominent [[barbel (anatomy)|barbel]]s, which resemble a [[cat]]'s [[whisker]]s, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species alive, the [[Mekong giant catfish]] from [[Southeast Asia]], the [[wels catfish]] of [[Eurasia]], and the [[Brachyplatystoma filamentosum|piraíba]] of [[South America]], to [[detritivore]]s (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny [[parasite|parasitic]] species commonly called the [[candiru]], ''Vandellia cirrhosa''. Neither the armour-plated types nor the naked types have scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels or &quot;whiskers&quot;. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and [[swimbladder]]. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are [[Aquaculture of catfish|farmed]] or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus ''[[Corydoras]]'', are important in the [[fishkeeping|aquarium hobby]].  Many catfish are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;aworld&quot;&gt;[http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/catfish/catfish.htm Catfish Varieties]. animal-world.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;samer&quot;&gt;Wong, Kate (6 June 2001) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-nocturnal-catfish-sta &quot;How Nocturnal Catfish Stalk Their Prey&quot;]. ''Scientific American''.&lt;/ref&gt; but others (many [[Auchenipteridae]]) are [[crepuscular]] or [[Diurnality|diurnal]] (most [[Loricariidae]] or [[Callichthyidae]], for example).

===Distribution and habitat===
[[File:Nigerian Fish sellers (13).jpg|thumb|Catfish vendor in [[Ilorin, Kwara]]]]
Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Catfish have inhabited all continents at one time or another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt; They are most diverse in [[tropics|tropical]] South America, Asia, and Africa, with one family native to North America and one family in Europe.&lt;ref name=tol/&gt; More than half of all catfish species live in the Americas. They are the only [[Ostariophysi|ostariophysan]]s that have entered [[fresh water|freshwater]] habitats in [[Madagascar]], Australia, and [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/aquatic-living-resources/article/alternative-lifehistory-strategies-of-catfishes/D8FEDFD14CC143C49E5F6CBAE1056CFB# |title=Alternative life-history strategies of catfishes|last=Bruton|first=Michael N.|journal=Aquat.

They are found in freshwater environments, though most inhabit shallow, running water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruton&quot;/&gt; Representatives of at least eight families are [[hypogean]] (live underground) with three families that are also [[troglobite|troglobitic]] (inhabiting caves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Morphological Adaptations of the Texas Blind Catfishes ''Trogloglanis pattersoni'' and ''Satan eurystomus'' (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae) to Their Underground Environment|first=Thomas G.|last=Langecker|author2=Longley, Glenn|journal=[[Copeia]]|year=1993|pages=976–986|doi=10.2307/1447075|volume=1993|issue=4|jstor=1447075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mexican blindcats genus ''Prietella'' (Siluriformes: Ictaluridae): an overview of recent explorations|first=Dean A.|last=Hendrickson|author2=Krejca, Jean K. |author3=Martinez, Juan Manuel Rodríguez |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|volume=62|pages=315–337|year=2001|doi=10.1023/A:1011808805094|s2cid=19962442}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such species is ''[[Phreatobius cisternarum]]'', known to live underground in [[phreatic]] habitats.&lt;ref name=pcisternarum&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Phreatobius|species=cisternarum|year=2007|month=Apr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous species from the families [[Ariidae]] and [[Plotosidae]], and a few species from among the [[Aspredinidae]] and [[Bagridae]], are found in salt water.&lt;ref&gt;Monks N.

These are (important) examples of instances in which the good intentions of the ''Uitvoerend Bewind'' and its ''Agenten'' met with the political and economic realities of the times. Other necessary reforms (the abolition of the guilds, the reform of the system of poor relief to mention but a few examples) equally came to nothing. These defeats progressively led to disenchantment of the population with the regime, that already was in an awkward position because it was also brushed with the tar of the depredations of the French &quot;sister republic&quot; that mainly viewed the Batavian Republic as a [[Dairy cattle|milk cow]], both collectively (in its demands for loans at very low interest rates&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;) and individually (in the demands of French officials for bribes and other extortions).&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglo-Russian invasion====
{{Main|Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland}}
The sagging popularity of the Republic did not escape the attention of the British intelligence services. However, because this intelligence was filtered through the eyes of Orangist agents in the Republic and émigrés in England, it was erroneously interpreted as possible support for an Orangist restoration. This caused the miscalculation that led to the ill-fated [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in the peninsula of North Holland in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the expedition ended in failure the members of the ''Uitvoerend Bewind'' became very nervous in the days before the [[Battle of Bergen (1799)|Battle of Bergen]]. The Agent for Foreign Affairs, [[Maarten van der Goes van Dirxland|Van der Goes]] who had been in favor of distancing the Republic from the French, chose this inopportune moment to secretly approach the King of Prussia as a mediator, with a scheme in which the Hereditary Prince was to become a kind of constitutional monarch in a constitution on the model of the American Constitution. The Republic would revert to its traditional neutrality, while Britain would occupy North Holland, and France [[Zeeland]]. The overture was rejected, and it caused a lot of embarrassment in the relations with the French ''Directoire''.&lt;ref&gt;The French demanded the expulsion from office of the &quot;culprits&quot;; Schama, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] performed his coup of [[18 Brumaire]], establishing the [[French Consulate]]. The Franco-Batavian relations now entered a whole new era.

===Staatsbewind and the Peace of Amiens===
{{main|Staatsbewind|Treaty of Amiens}}

====Pressure for constitutional reform====
Though Napoleon had a warlike reputation, his policies in his first years as [[First Consul]] were aimed at restoring peace in Europe, be it at terms favorable to France. The animus of the members of the Second Coalition was mostly against the French Revolution, its ideas and its consequences. By this time Napoleon himself was convinced of their perfidy. Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise, in which France would retain its chain of docile client states, but with the &quot;revolutionary&quot; sting removed, to appease the Allies. That unrevolutionary docility was to be assured by constitutions designed to eliminate not only domestic conflict (as was the new French political order), but also any flashes of impertinent nationalism. France therefore embarked on a program of constitutional reform in the dependent republics, first in the [[Helvetic Republic]], where Napoleon as Mediator imposed the [[Constitution of Malmaison]] in 1801 (followed by the [[Second Helvetic Constitution]] a year later), restoring the old confederal order.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 410–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar &quot;solution&quot; seemed appropriate for the Batavian Republic. The Batavian government, and its constitution, were particularly disliked by the Consul (no friend of democracy in any case), because of the snub that Amsterdam bankers gave in 1800 to his request for a big loan at the usual generous rate of interest the French expected as a matter of right.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 406–409, 412&lt;/ref&gt; He blamed the ''Uitvoerend Bewind'' for this, and many other foibles, like undermining the boycott of British goods. To remedy these ills, a new Batavian constitution on the political principles of the Consulate (union, authority, political office for men of ability and social station) was needed. The new French ambassador [[Charles Louis Huguet, marquis de Sémonville]] he sent to The Hague in 1799 was just the man for this job.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, even the minds of reformers like Gogel had become receptive to the need for change. The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by &quot;Bonapartist&quot; means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, in the hands of the old regent class. Director [[Augustijn Gerhard Besier|Besier]] in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a &quot;National College&quot; (akin to the French Senate) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors [[François Ermerins]] and [[Jean Henri van Swinden]], and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Augereau-coup====
The majority in the ''Uitvoerend Bewind'' (Gerrit Pijman in particular) therefore amended the project in a sense that gave re-federalization even more emphasis. They unilaterally convened the primary assemblies by a proclamation on 14 September 1801, have a [[Batavian Republic constitutional referendum, 1801|referendum on this new draft constitution]]. The Assembly defiantly ruled this proclamation illegal on 18 September. Then General Augereau (he of the Fructidor-coup), now commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Netherlands, routinely closed the doors of the Assembly (by previous arrangement with Pijman) on 19 September, and arrested the dissident Directors. Despite this military putsch the campaign for the plebiscite took place in an atmosphere of political freedom unthinkable in France. Nevertheless, this did not result in great enthusiasm for the new constitution. When the votes were counted on 1 October, out of 416,619 voters only 16,771 voted in favor and 52,219 against. The Directors then used a sleight of hand that unfortunately would also become familiar in the Dutch constitutional politics of the successor states: they counted the 350,000 abstentions as &quot;tacit affirmations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the coup of June 1798, the Augereau coup did present a sharp break with the recent past. The new constitution reduced the role of the legislative branch (which now did not have the right of initiative), and expanded the powers of the Executive, which  now became known as the ''Staatsbewind'' (Regency of State). The elective principle was reduced to a formality: the ''Staatsbewind'', originally consisting of the three directors taking part in the coup, expanded its membership by co-optation to twelve. This executive then appointed the first 35 members of the legislature. As vacancies arose, these were filled, as far as possible, on a provincial rota and according to national quotas of representatives of each province (much like the old States-General). Except for Holland, the old provinces were reconstituted. The local and provincial administrative organs continued to be elected - no longer by universal manhood suffrage, but by a system of [[Suffrage#Census suffrage|census suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 419–420; the qualification for standing for office was 200 guilders in annual city taxes or 300 guilders in house rent; 10,000 guilders of real estate or 20,000 guilders worth of securities; Schama, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most important was the change in personnel of these organs, mostly as a consequence of this electoral change. The &quot;democrats&quot; were mostly replaced by Patriot regents, who had no patience with democracy, and by the old Orangist regents, who did not even have to disguise their allegiance as in early 1801 a convenient amnesty  was proclaimed. One surprising example is [[Egbert Sjuck Gerrold Juckema van Burmania Rengers]], the Orangist [[burgomaster]] of [[Leeuwarden]] before 1795, a notorious reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;
Schama writes about him: &quot;His activities both in 1787 and 1794 had earned Burmania Rengers an unsavoury reputation as one of the more enthusiastic bloodhounds of the old regime in Friesland, ...&quot;; Schama, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

The coup represented a counter-revolution. This became clear in the way the [[iconography]] of the 1795 revolution disappeared: the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] ''Vrijheid, Gelijkheid, Broederschap'' (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) which had adorned all official publications, was henceforth removed, and the last [[Liberty Tree]]s were removed from the town squares. Soon the &quot;good old days&quot; of nepotism and venality were restored. Equally, though the abolition of the guilds formally remained, in practice regulation of crafts and trades was reimposed by local ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 423–428.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peace negotiations====
[[File:Gillray - The First Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|In ''The first Kiss this Ten Years! —or—the meeting of Britannia &amp; Citizen François'' (1803), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the peace between France and Britain.]]

Against this background the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor participants in the negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free British shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch [[plenipotentiary]], vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised not to make a separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the [[Indemnity|indemnification]] of the Prince of Orange.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 437–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

That indemnification was an important sideshow in the negotiations. The consequence of the Peace Treaty was that the Batavian Republic now received international recognition, even by the British, and that the old Dutch Republic was now irreversibly dead. This put an end to all pretensions of the Stadtholder and his heirs, such as they were. It may be important to note that these pretensions were dubious to begin with. The Stadtholder was never the sovereign power in the Netherlands, despite understandable misconceptions by foreigners, who may have thought that a country needed a head of state, and the Stadtholder was it. Instead he was an officeholder, appointed by the provincial States, who also was captain-general and admiral-general of the Union (there was originally no stadtholder on the confederal level).

In the Orangist revolution of 1747 this office had been revamped to &quot;Stadhouder-generaal&quot; and made hereditary, and after the Prussian intervention of 1787 the powers of the Stadtholder had become dictatorial. But formally the States-General had been sovereign since 1588, and the Stadtholder was merely their &quot;first servant.&quot;  The British may have entertained certain fantasies about his formal status, but never seriously considered it.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, p. 1127.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would the British acceptance of the surrender of the Batavian fleet in the name of the Stadtholder in 1799, as though he was a sovereign prince. But this was all make-believe, and it ended with the peace of 1802 (though it was revived in 1813).&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prince had reason to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, the loss of his hereditary offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The ''Staatsbewind'' refused to pay this, or any sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions&lt;ref&gt;The Prussian king was the stadtholder's brother-in-law and his sister continually pleaded with her brother on her husband's behalf; Schama, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of [[Fulda]] and [[Corvey Abbey]] (see also [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short interlude of peace====
The Treaty restored most of the colonies that had been captured by the British since 1795, except [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]], but including the [[Cape Colony]]. This now made the attempts in the Asiatic Council,&lt;ref&gt;''Raad van Aziatische Bezittingen en Etablissementen'' (Council of Asian Possessions and Establishments).&lt;/ref&gt; which had replaced the Directorate of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] in 1799, to reform the management of the colonies, more urgent. [[Dirk van Hogendorp (1761–1822)|Dirk van Hogendorp]] was commissioned to write a proposal, that met with considerable enthusiasm from the more progressive elements on the council, like [[Samuel Iperusz. Wiselius]] and [[Johannes Neethling|J.H.Neethling]]. He proposed to abolish all [[perquisites]] and [[sinecure]]s; to permit private trade; to permit native subjects to own private property; to substitute the &quot;land levies&quot; by a regulated land tax; and the abolition of all [[Heerlijkheid#Heerlijkheid rights|seigneurial rights]] in the colonies. This met with overwhelming resistance from vested interests. When a new Charter for the colonies was promulgated, Hogendorp's proposals had been whittled down to insignificance The vestigial democrats on the Council were now purged in favor of Orangist reactionaries like [[Hendrik Mollerus]], and [[Hendrik Van Stralen]]. In any case, the Republic did not enjoy the possession of its colonies for long. After the resumption of hostilities in 1803 the returned colonies in most cases were soon recaptured by the British. [[Java]], however, remained Dutch until 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potentially important consequence of the peace might have been that a number of provisions of the Treaty of The Hague, that had been conditional on a peace, like the reduction of the French army of occupation, would now have become operational. However, the First Consul proved reluctant to reduce the numbers of French troops, or return the port of Flushing, for the good of the Dutch as he pointed out, as they needed many of their own troops in their restored colonies, so the &quot;protection&quot; of the French troops was considered necessary. On the other hand, the departure of the French troops was an indispensable point for the British as they could not allow the Netherlands to be dominated by a hostile power, and the Batavian Republic was incapable of defending its own neutrality. This was to be an insoluble dilemma in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

Real advantages of the peace came in the economic field.&lt;ref&gt;See for a discussion of the economic developments in the Republic [[Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815)]].&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[open economy]], the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign [[protectionism]]) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British [[privateer]]ing had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|fata morgana]]. True, much of the trade had shifted to [[flags of convenience]] (especially that of the US and European [[Neutral country|neutrals]] like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, and the decline of the fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Invasion preparations and economic warfare====
In any case, the peace turned out to be of short duration. On 18 May 1803, slightly more than a year after the peace, war resumed. Napoleon was now intent on the destruction of Great Britain by culminating in an ambitious [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|planned invasion]]. The Batavian Republic was to play a major supporting role in this. As the Franco-Batavian alliance's embodiment, the ''Staatsbewind'' was forced to assent to a Convention bringing the total of French and Batavian forces in the Netherlands to 35,000. In addition, 9,000 Batavian troops were earmarked for the proposed overseas expedition. Even more importantly, the Dutch were to supply, by December 1803, five ships-of-the-line, five frigates, 100 gun boats, and 250 flat-bottomed transport craft, capable of holding 60–80 men. In total the Dutch were meant to provide transport for 25,000 men and 2,500 horses; the major part of Napoleon's invasion &quot;armada&quot;, and all at Dutch expense. It was all a fantasy on Napoleon's part, but this did not diminish the real burden it imposed on the finances of the Republic, and on its economy.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another real burden was the [[economic warfare]] that Napoleon launched against the British, and which was answered by a British counter-boycott. This was to foreshadow the [[Continental System]] which was written into law in 1806.  However already in 1803 it started to somewhat choke off Dutch trade. Ostensibly, the ''Staatsbewind'' did its part by prohibiting the import of all enemy goods on 5 July 1803. Later it banned cheese exports and butter. These gestures were, however, of little practical effect: in 1804 the volume of general exports to Britain was nearly equal to that in the last year of peace: 1802. British goods reached Dutch destinations via neutral German ports, or disguised as &quot;American cargo.&quot; The republic was therefore an important &quot;keyhole into Europe&quot; that undermined the economic sanctions against Britain. As the members of the ''Staatsbewind'', and their friends, often profited from this clandestine trade directly, the patience of the French was wearing thin.&lt;ref&gt;In the old Republic trading with the enemy had been looked upon as a necessary evil. The Admiralties had been partially financed with so-called ''[[Admiralty of Amsterdam#&quot;Convooi&quot; and &quot;Licent&quot;|licenten]]'', license fees for allowing such trade&lt;/ref&gt; Matters came to a head when the French commander in the Republic, [[Auguste de Marmont]], ordered in November 1804 that French naval patrols and customs officials were to take over the responsibility for the surveillance of cargoes in Dutch ports, with powers of confiscation without reference to Dutch authorities. This was the last straw for the ''Staatsbewind.'' On 23 November 1804, they forbade any Batavian official to take orders from the French.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.463–464.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last Grand Pensionary and end of the Republic===
This act of defiance sealed the fate of yet another of the Batavian regimes. Napoleon had long been dissatisfied with what he viewed as the foot-dragging and inefficiency of the Dutch. As a matter of fact, since the Spring of 1804 informal talks, mediated by Talleyrand, had been under way with the Batavian envoy in Paris, [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck|Schimmelpenninck]], who had a good personal rapport with Napoleon (by now [[First French Empire|emperor]]). Schimmelpenninck was a power in the Batavian Republic by himself. He had played an important role as the leader of the federalist opposition in the &quot;revolutionary&quot; States-General of 1795, and the first Assembly. Though an opponent of the radicals, he had politically survived the coups of 1798, and served as ambassador to France, and as plenipotentiary to the Amiens negotiations. Now Napoleon saw him as the person to clean the [[Augeas|Augean stables]] of the Dutch client state.

[[File:RJschimmelpenninck.jpg|thumb|left|Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as [[Grand Pensionary]]]]

Schimmelpenninck saw himself in the same light. He had long had a woolly vision of a &quot;national conciliation&quot; in the Netherlands, that made him amenable to a rapprochement with conservative and Orangist circles. These were to become his power base. Though Schimmelpenninck was a convinced federalist, he was a pliable character also. When Napoleon indicated that he preferred a centralized organization of the Dutch state (as the re-federalized model of the ''Staatsbewind'' had clearly not worked out), he did not hesitate to implement this in his project of a new constitution, that he constructed in the Summer of 1804 in consultation with the ''Staatsbewind''. As a matter of fact, a delegation of the ''Staatsbewind'', consisting of Schimmelpenninck, and members of the Regency Van der Goes (the former Agent) and Van Haersolte (a former Director), presented the case for this draft to Napoleon in November 1804. When the clash about the French customs men therefore took place later in the month, Napoleon came to a speedy decision and soon thereafter the Batavian Republic had a new constitution and government.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 460–464.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1805, Schimmelpenninck was therefore inaugurated as ''Raadpensionaris'' (Grand Pensionary) of the Batavian Republic. This venerable title (clearly chosen for sentimental reasons) had little connection with the former office of the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]]; as a matter of fact, the new office more resembled that of Stadtholder, though even William V, after 1787, had not possessed the powers Schimmelpenninck was to wield. His was a one-man Executive that would in no way be encumbered by the 19 man Legislative Corps, that had no powers apart from the Pensionary. The Pensionary conducted his business assisted by a ''Staatsraad'', that resembled the French [[Council of State (France)#History|Conseil d'État]] more than the old ''Raad van State'', and by Secretaries of State, who resembled the ''Agenten'' of the ''Uitvoerend Bewind''.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 468, 474&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, such an important change in the constitution had to receive the imprimatur of the popular will. A plebiscite was duly organized which elicited 14,903 Yes-votes (against 136 Noes) from an electorate of 353,322. The abstentions were counted as &quot;tacit affirmatives&quot; in the now well-established tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 467; There was one recorded no-vote in Groningen; Schama, ch. 11, fn. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime actually accomplished more in its short existence than the previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This was, of course, mainly due to the diligent preparatory work that Agents like the ubiquitous Gogel; [[Johannes Goldberg]], for National Economy; and [[Johannes van der Palm]], for National Education; had done.
Gogel's General Taxation Plan was finally enacted in June 1805; a first government-approved attempt at unification of the Dutch [[History of Dutch orthography|spelling]] was made; an embryonic Department of Agriculture and Department of Hydraulics were formed, to foreshadow the later government departments; even a ''Pharmacopeia Batavia'' started the regulation of drugs; and the School Law of 1806 organized a national system of public elementary education. Most importantly perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 474–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French reaction to this flurry of reforms was mixed, however. The very zeal of the program might betoken a renascent nationalism that could work against French interests. The debacle of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] had made it clear that the projected invasion had to be scrapped. The Dutch now began to clamor for economies in the form of the return of the Boulogne flotilla, which annoyed Napoleon, because he still had a use for it. The man who had led that flotilla to Boulogne [[Carel Hendrik Ver Huell]], was now Secretary for the Navy. He had also become a confidant of the emperor, and now engaged in a secret correspondence with Talleyrand and Napoleon. The latter had just concluded the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] and was busy dividing up Europe in client-kingdoms apportioned to his relatives. He saw a good candidate for such a position in the Netherlands in his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]].

Ver Huell started scheming with his French patrons behind the back of Schimmelpenninck and feeding negative information about the Pensionary that found its way into the French press. Schimmelpenninck's position was weakened by the fact that he was slowly going blind. The Dutch Secretaries of State and the ''Staatsraad'' didn't have much choice: their only options were a complete extinguishing of the national identity in the form of annexation to the Empire, or the lesser evil of a new kingdom under one of Napoleon's relatives. A ''Groot Besogne'' (Grand Commission) was formed to conduct the unequal negotiations with the Emperor. The latter, however, refused to speak with the Commission, and only communicated to them through the intermediary of Ver Huell. Talleyrand had meanwhile drafted a &quot;Treaty&quot; which contained the conditions under which the crown of &quot;Holland&quot; was to be offered to Louis: no union of the crowns; no [[conscription]]; a possible commercial treaty with France; and the basic freedoms of the Netherlands (linguistic, religious, judicial) were to be maintained; while the [[civil list]] was fixed at the &quot;modest sum&quot; of 1.5 million guilders. The constitution of the Pensionary was actually to be maintained with a few minor alterations (the title of ''raadpensionaris'' changed to that of King; and the size of the ''Staatsraad'' and the legislative corps nearly doubled).&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 482–485.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was not allowed to refer back to The Hague. Schimmelpenninck made a last-ditch attempt to have the treaty referred to a plebiscite, but he was ignored. He resigned on 4 June 1806. The next day in St. Cloud, after Napoleon had kept them waiting while he received the Turkish ambassador, the hapless commissioners presented their &quot;petition&quot; to Louis to accept the crown of &quot;Holland&quot;, which he graciously did, while Napoleon looked on approvingly.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 485–486&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:HogendorpDuynStirum.jpg|thumb|upright|Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp, [[Frans Adam van der Duyn van Maasdam]] and [[Leopold van Limburg Stirum]], monument at 1813 Square, [[The Hague]]]]
The [[Kingdom of Holland]] lasted only four years. Though Louis performed his role beyond all expectations, and did his best to defend the interests of his subjects, this was exactly the reason why Napoleon decided that the Netherlands could no longer be denied the blessings of being reunited with his Empire, though over the objections of Louis. Louis abdicated on 2 July 1810, in favor of his son [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]], who reigned for ten days. Then the Netherlands were finally reunited with the origins of the &quot;alluvial deposits of the French rivers,&quot; of which the country in the view of Napoleon consists.&lt;ref&gt;By the Rambouillet decree of 9 July 1810; Robert Walsh, ''The American Review of History and Politics, And General Repository of Literature and State Papers'', Farrand and Nicholas, 1811, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

This reunion did not outlast the effects of the disastrous [[French invasion of Russia]], and the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. The Empire melted away, and the independent Netherlands took shape again with every city that the retreating French army of occupation evacuated in the course of 1813.
In the ensuing political vacuum a triumvirate of former Orangist regents, led by [[Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp]], invited the former Hereditary Prince (the old Stadtholder had died in 1806) to assume power as &quot;Sovereign Prince.&quot; William VI of Orange landed in Scheveningen on 30 November 1813. He duly established control in the Netherlands and was offered the crown of the combined area of the former 17 provinces of the Netherlands (modern [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]) by the Allies in the secret London Protocol (also known as the [[Eight Articles of London]]) of 21 June 1814, which he accepted exactly one month later. On 16 March 1815, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was proclaimed.

===Historiographical note===
[[File:Johan Heinrich Neuman - Johan Rudolf Thorbecke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]]]]
According to the British historian [[Simon Schama]], the Batavian Republic has been controversially treated by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 15–23&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)|Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]] during [[World War II]] there were some&lt;ref&gt;Schama does not name names, but refers for an iconic example  to an article in a 1950 issue of the popular Dutch weekly ''Elseviers Weekblad'', in which the Batavians are called &quot;the NSBers of the eighteenth century;&quot; Schama, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  who saw a historical parallel between the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|Dutch National Socialist Movement]] (NSB) and the Patriot revolutionaries, while they pictured William V in the heroic role of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] and her government-in-exile. Dutch historian [[Pieter Geyl]] opposed such comparisons in his ''Patriotten en NSBers: een historische parallel'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 16 and fn. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, by that time the Batavians had already had a bad press in Dutch history writing. This may be explained by the fact that the ages-old ideological struggle between the monarchically oriented Orangist party and its successive opponents of a more &quot;republican&quot; bent (going back to at least the conflict between [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] and [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]]), of which the Patriots were only the latest incarnation, was being refought in the standard works of 19th-century Dutch historians like [[Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer]], who saw plenty to despise in the &quot;popular-sovereignty&quot; philosophy of the Patriot radicals. In his turn Groen was very influential on the way [[John Lothrop Motley]] depicted the old Dutch Republic for an American audience.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Motley did not get to deal explicitly with the Batavian Republic, but the way his collaborator [[William Elliot Griffis]] dismissed the Patriots speaks for itself: &quot;...whether under the name of the 'Batavian Republic', the Kingdom of Holland, or the provinces of the French empire, the French occupation was virtually a French conquest that had little permanent influence on Dutch history or character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Griffis ''Motley's Dutch Nation: Being the Rise of the Dutch Republic (1555-1584)'' (1908), p. 898.&lt;/ref&gt;

However most, if not all, characteristics of the current centralized state of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] were foreshadowed by the accomplishments of the Batavian Republic, not least the liberal [[Constitution of the Netherlands#History|1848 Constitution]]. That constitution restored the central tenets of the democratic ''Staatsregeling'' of 1798, under the guise of a [[Constitutional monarchy]], as its author [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]] acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For primary and secondary education, government schools educate approximately 60 percent of Australian students, with approximately 40 percent in non-government schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;absyear&quot; /&gt; At the tertiary level, the majority of [[List of universities in Australia|Australia's universities]] are public, and student fees are subsidised through a [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|student loan program]] where payment becomes due when debtors reach a certain income level.

Underpinned by the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]], implemented in 1995, Australia has adopted a national system of qualifications, encompassing higher education, vocational education and training (VET), and school-based education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aqf.edu.au/what-is-the-aqf |title=What is the AQF |work=Australian Qualifications Framework |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |date=n.d. |access-date=3 September 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For primary and secondary schools, a national [[Australian Curriculum]] has been progressively developed and implemented since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculumhistory|title=Curriculum version history |date=n.d. |work=The Australian Curriculum |publisher=[[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] |language=en-AU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704204435/http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/curriculumhistory |archive-date=4 July 2017 |access-date=4 June 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a leading global provider of education to international students; and, after the United States and the United Kingdom, is ranked as the third-largest provider of international education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd.org/education/EAG2012%20-%20Country%20note%20-%20Australia.pdf |title=Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2012 |website=www.oecd.org |publisher=OECD |date=2012 |access-date=10 September 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au&quot;&gt;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/booming-student-market-a-valuable-property/news-story/6bb3823260aa3443f0c26909406d089b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macrobusiness.com.au&quot;&gt;https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/11/australian-universities-double-down-on-international-students/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Education Index]], published with the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Human Development Index]] in 2018, based on data from 2017, listed Australia as 0.929, the second-highest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/data|title=Human Development Data (1990-2017)|date=14 September 2018|work=Human Development Reports |publisher=United National Development Program |access-date=6 August 2019|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the Australian Government signed the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], that aimed to combat discrimination and [[racial segregation]] in the field of education.

== Regulation and funding ==
The regulation, operation, and funding of education is the responsibility of the [[States and territories of Australia|States and territories]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ACARA2017&quot;/&gt; because the Australian Government does not have a specific [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|constitutional power]] to pass laws with respect to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html|title=COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT - SECT 51 Legislative powers of the Parliament [see Notes 10 and 11]|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044012/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html|archive-date=11 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Federal government helps to fund non-government schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aea2013210/s21.html|title=AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION ACT 2013 - SECT 21 Financial assistance for schools|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190538/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aea2013210/s21.html|archive-date=31 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; helps to fund public universities and subsidises tertiary education through [[Tertiary education fees in Australia|a national student loan scheme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hefa1988221/|title=HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING ACT 1988|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324005521/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hefa1988221/|archive-date=24 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regulates vocational education providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nveatra2011492/|title=NATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING REGULATOR ACT 2011|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=19 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319235130/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nveatra2011492/|archive-date=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-compulsory education is regulated within the [[Australian Qualifications Framework]], a unified system of national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training, and the tertiary education sector.

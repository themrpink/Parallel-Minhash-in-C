For Horthy, Hitler served as a bulwark against Soviet encroachment or invasion. Horthy was obsessed with the Communist threat. One American diplomat remarked that Horthy's anti-Communist tirades were so common and ferocious that diplomats &quot;discounted it as a phobia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The comments of U.S. Minister to Hungary Nicholas Roosevelt, quoted in Frank, Tibor, ''Discussing Hitler: Advisors of U.S. Diplomacy in Central Europe'', 1934–1941, Central European University press, 2003, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Horthy clearly saw his country as trapped between two stronger powers, both of them dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could – not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance. The means by which the regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged. Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one – largely due, he said, to his unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.&lt;ref&gt;Nandor F. Dreisziger, &quot;Bridges to the West: The Horthy Regime's ‘Reinsurance Policies’ in 1941.&quot; ''War &amp; Society'' 7.1 (1989): 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horthy's attitude to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state that refused to accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was the most important factor in war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eby, Cecil page 9&quot;&gt;Eby, Cecil ''Hungary at War: Civilians and Soldiers in World War II'', University Park: Penn State Press, 2007 page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went on to tell Hitler that he must be careful not to do anything that might cause an Anglo–German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the ''[[Third Reich|Reich]]''. Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eby, Cecil page 9&quot;/&gt;

In August 1938, when Horthy, his wife, and some Hungarian politicians took a special train from Budapest to Germany, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and other [[Nazism|National Socialist]] formations ceremonially welcomed the delegation at the [[Passau]] train station. The train then continued to [[Kiel]] for the [[Ceremonial ship launching|christening]] of the [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|German cruiser ''Prinz Eugen'']].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Rosmus, ''Hitlers Nibelungen'', Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 166f&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ensuing state visit, Hitler asked Horthy for troops and matériel to participate in Germany's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia. In exchange, Horthy later reported, &quot;He gave me to understand that as a reward we should be allowed to keep the territory we had invaded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; Horthy said he declined, insisting to Hitler that Hungary's claims on the disputed lands should be settled by peaceful means.&lt;ref&gt;Miklós Horthy, ''Memoirs''. R. Speller, 1957, reprinted in 2000.

[[File:Košice 11. november 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Horthy at the annexation of south-east Czechoslovakia, Kassa (present-day Košice), 11 November 1938]]
Three months later, after the [[Munich Agreement]] put control of Czechoslovakia's [[Sudetenland]] in Hitler's hands, by the [[First Vienna Award]] Hungary annexed some of the south-eastern parts of Czechoslovakia. Horthy enthusiastically rode into the re-acquired territories at the head of his troops, greeted by emotional ethnic Hungarians: &quot;As I passed along the roads, people embraced one another, fell upon their knees, and wept with joy because liberation had come to them at last, without war, without bloodshed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; But as &quot;peaceful&quot; as this annexation was, and as just as it may have seemed to many Hungarians, it was a dividend of Hitler's brinksmanship and threats of war, in which Hungary was now inextricably complicit. Hungary was now committed to the Axis agenda: on 24 February 1939, it joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], and on 11 April, it withdrew from the [[League of Nations]]. American journalists began to refer to Hungary as &quot;the jackal of Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William Wohlforth, 'Deadly Imbalances: Tripolarity and Hitler's Strategy of World Conquest'' (Columbia University Press 1998), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination of menace and reward drifted Hungary closer to the status of a Nazi client state.&lt;ref&gt;John Flournoy Montgomery, ''Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite'' Part Two: An Oasis in Hitler's Desert&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1939, when Hitler took what remained of Czechoslovakia by force, Hungary was allowed to annex [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. After a conflict with the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|First Slovak Republic]] during the [[Slovak–Hungarian War]] of 1939, Hungary gained further territories. In August 1940, Hitler intervened on Hungary's behalf once again. After the failed Hungarian-Romanian negotiations, Hungary annexed [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania by the [[Second Vienna Award]].

[[File:Komárno november 1938 (1).jpg|thumb|Horthy during the Hungarians' entry into Komárom (present-day [[Komárno]]), following the First Vienna Award, November 1938]]

But despite their cooperation with the Nazi regime, Horthy and his government would be better described as &quot;conservative authoritarian&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miklós Lojkó. ''Meddling in Middle Europe: Britain and the 'Lands Between, 1919–1925'', Central European University Press, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q-IOJWicco8C&amp;pg=PA180 p 180]&lt;/ref&gt; than &quot;fascist&quot;. Certainly Horthy was as hostile to the home-grown fascist and ultra-nationalist movements that emerged in Hungary between the wars (particularly the [[Arrow Cross Party]]) as he was to Communism. The Arrow Cross leader, [[Ferenc Szálasi]], was repeatedly imprisoned at Horthy's command.

[[John Flournoy Montgomery|John F. Montgomery]], who served in Budapest as U.S. ambassador from 1933 to 1941, openly admired this side of Horthy's character and reported the following incident in his memoir: in March 1939, Arrow Cross supporters disrupted a performance at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Budapest opera house]] by chanting &quot;Justice for Szálasi!&quot; loud enough for the regent to hear. A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went to take a closer look, he discovered that:&lt;blockquote&gt;two or three men were on the floor and he [Horthy] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: &quot;So you would betray your country, would you?&quot; The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, John F. ''Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite'', Part One: What Price Independence?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Hungary 1941-44 Administrative Map.png|left|thumb|300 px|Hungary in 1941, after recovering territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia]]

And yet, by the time of this episode, Horthy had allowed his government to give in to Nazi demands that the Hungarians enact laws restricting the lives of the country's Jews. The first Hungarian anti-Jewish Law, in 1938, limited the number of Jews in the professions, the government and commerce to twenty percent, and the second reduced it to five percent the following year; 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their jobs as a result. A &quot;Third Jewish Law&quot; of August 1941 prohibited Jews from marrying non-Jews and defined anyone having two Jewish grandparents as &quot;racially Jewish&quot;. A Jewish man who had non-marital sex with a &quot;decent non-Jewish woman resident in Hungary&quot; could be sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Patai, Raphael. ''The Jews of Hungary'', Wayne State University Press, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt;

Horthy's personal views on Jews and their role in Hungarian society are the subject of some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister [[Pál Teleki]], Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry – success that needed to be curtailed:&lt;blockquote&gt;As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, one of the most important tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, for we should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patai|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===War===
[[File:Miklós Horthy and Adolf Hitler 1938.jpg|thumb|Horthy with Hitler in 1938]]
The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1944)|Kingdom of Hungary]] was gradually drawn into the war itself.  In 1939 and 1940, [[Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War|Hungarian volunteers]] were sent to Finland's [[Winter War]], but did not have time to partake in the fighting before the end of the war. In April 1941, Hungary became, in effect, a member of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].  Hungary permitted Hitler to send troops across Hungarian territory for the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and ultimately sent its own troops to claim its share of the dismembered [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Prime Minister [[Pál Teleki]], horrified that he had failed to prevent this collusion with the Nazis, despite the fact that he had signed a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia in December 1940, committed suicide.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

In June 1941, the Hungarian government finally yielded to Hitler's demands that the nation contribute to the Axis war effort. On 27 June, Hungary became part of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and declared war on the [[Soviet Union]].  The Hungarians sent in troops and material only four days after Hitler began his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.

Eighteen months later, less well-equipped and less motivated than their German allies, 200,000 troops of the [[Hungarian Second Army]] ended up holding the front on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] west of [[Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;Deak, István, ''Endgame in Budapest'', Hungarian Quarterly, Autumn 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The first massacre of Jewish people from Hungarian territory took place in August 1941, when government officials ordered the deportation of Jews without Hungarian citizenship (principally refugees from other Nazi-occupied countries) to [[Ukraine]]. Roughly 18,000–20,000 of these deportees were slaughtered by [[Friedrich Jeckeln]] and his [[SS]] troops; only 2,000–3,000 survived. These killings are known as the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre]]. This event, in which the slaughter of Jews for the first time numbered in the tens of thousands, is considered to be among the first large-scale massacre of the [[Holocaust]]. Because of the objections of Hungary's leadership, the deportations were halted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaust in Hungary. About the Kamianets-Podilskyi nassacre (in hungarian language).&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holokausztmagyarorszagon.hu/index.php?section=1&amp;type=content&amp;chapter=2_2_3 |title=Holocaust in Hungary. About the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre (in hungarian language) |publisher=Holokausztmagyarorszagon.hu |accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1942, Horthy was already seeking to put some distance between himself and Hitler's regime. That March, he dismissed the pro-German prime minister [[László Bárdossy]], and replaced him with [[Miklós Kállay]], a moderate whom Horthy expected to loosen Hungary's ties to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Borhi, László, ''Hungary in the Cold War 1945–1956: Between the United States and the Soviet Union'', Central European University Press, New York 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Kállay successfully sabotaged economic cooperation with Nazi Germany, protected refugees and prisoners, resisted Nazi pressure regarding Jews, established contact with the Allies and negotiated conditions under which Hungary would switch sides against Germany. However the Allies were not close enough. When the Germans occupied Hungary in March 1944 Kállay went into hiding. He was finally captured by the Nazis, but was liberated when the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Kállay, ''Hungarian Premier: A Personal Account of a Nation's Struggle in the Second World War'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1942, personal tragedy struck the Hungarian Regent. 37-year-old [[István Horthy]], Horthy's eldest son, was killed.  István Horthy was the Deputy Regent of Hungary and a Flight Lieutenant in the reserves, 1/1 Fighter Squadron of the [[Royal Hungarian Air Force]]. He was killed when his Hawk (''[[MÁVAG Héja|Héja]]'') fighter crashed at an air field near [[Ilovskoye]].

In January 1943, Hungary's enthusiasm for the war effort, never especially high, suffered a tremendous blow. The Soviet army, in the full momentum of its triumphant turnaround after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], punched through Romanian troops at a bend in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and virtually obliterated the Second Hungarian Army in a few days' fighting. In this single action, Hungarian combat fatalities jumped by 80,000. Jew and non-Jew suffered together in this defeat, as the Hungarian troops had been accompanied by some 40,000 Jews and political prisoners in forced-labour units whose job had been to clear minefields.&lt;ref&gt;Lázár, István, ''Hungary: A Brief History'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

German officials blamed Hungary's Jews for the nation's &quot;defeatist attitude.&quot;  In the wake of the Don bend disaster, Hitler demanded at an April 1943 meeting that Horthy punish the 800,000 Jews still living in Hungary, who according to Hitler were responsible for this defeat. In response, Horthy and his government supplied 10,000 Jewish deportees for labour battalions. With the growing awareness the Allies might well win the war, it became more expedient not to comply with further German requests. Cautiously, the Hungarian government began to explore contacts with the Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Deak, ''Endgame in Budapest''&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation within the area of Hungary around 63,000 Jews perished.&lt;ref&gt;''Hungary and the Holocaust Confrontation with the Past'' (2001) (Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies United States Holocaust Memorial Museum); Tim Cole;  ''Hungary, the Holocaust, and Hungarians: Remembering Whose History?''  p. 3-5; [https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2001-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Hungarian Jews suffered close to 560,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph L. Braham; (2010) ''Hungarian, German, and Jewish calculations and miscalculations in the last chapter of the Holocaust'' p. 9-10; Washington, D.C. : Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Publication_OP_2010-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
{{main|Operation Margarethe}}

By 1944, the Axis was losing the war, and the [[Red Army]] was at Hungary's borders. Fearing that the Soviets would overrun the country, Kállay, with Horthy's approval, put out numerous feelers to the Allies.  He even promised to surrender unconditionally to them once they reached Hungarian territory.  An enraged Hitler summoned Horthy to a conference in [[Schloss Klessheim|Klessheim Castle]] near [[Salzburg]]. He pressured Horthy to make greater contributions to the war effort and again commanded him to assist in the killing of more of Hungary's Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horthy now permitted the deportation of a large number of Jews (the generally accepted figure is 100,000), but would not go further.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, Randolph, ''The Politics of Genocide'', Wayne State University Press, pp. 59–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was a ruse. As Horthy was returning home on 19 March, the [[Wehrmacht]] invaded and occupied Hungary. Horthy was told he could only stay in office if he dismissed Kállay and appointed a new government that would fully cooperate with Hitler and his plenipotentiary in Budapest, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]].  Knowing the likely alternative was a [[gauleiter]] who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other countries under Nazi occupation, Horthy acquiesced and appointed his ambassador to Germany, General [[Döme Sztójay]], as prime minister.  The Germans originally wanted Horthy to reappoint [[Béla Imrédy]] (who had been prime minister from 1938 to 1939), but Horthy had enough influence to get Veesenmayer to accept Sztójay instead. Contrary to Horthy's hopes, Sztójay's government eagerly proceeded to participate in the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The chief agents of this collaboration were [[Andor Jaross]], the Minister of the Interior, and his two rabidly anti-Semitic state secretaries, [[László Endre]] and [[László Baky]] (later to be known as the &quot;Deportation Trio&quot;). On 9 April, Prime Minister Sztójay and the Germans obligated Hungary to place 300,000 Jewish people at the &quot;disposal&quot; of the Reich, in effect, sentencing most of Hungary's remaining Jews to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Five days later, on 14 April, Endre, Baky, and SS Lieutenant-Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] commenced the deportation of the remaining Hungarian Jews. The [[Yellow badge|Yellow Star]], [[Ghetto]]ization laws, and deportation were accomplished in less than 8 weeks with the help of the new Hungarian government and authorities. The deportation of Hungarian Jews to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] began on 14 May 1944 and continued at a rate of 12–14,000 a day until 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Evans, The Third Reich at War, pg 617–618.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Sztójay: I was aware that the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is the handling of the Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. As such, I was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken out of the hands of Deputy Minister László Endre. Further more, László Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Just before the deportations began, two Slovak Jewish prisoners, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the [[Vrba-Wetzler Report]], was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials. Details from the report were broadcast by the BBC on 15 June and printed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 20 June.&lt;ref name=Rees&gt;[[Laurence Rees|Rees, Laurence]], ''Auschwitz: A New History'', Public Affairs, 2005. {{ISBN|1-58648-357-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; World leaders, including [[Pope Pius XII]] (25 June), President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on 26 June, and King [[Gustaf V of Sweden]] on 30 June,&lt;ref name=HolokausztMo&gt;[http://www.holokausztmagyarorszagon.hu/index.php?section=1&amp;type=content&amp;chapter=4_3_2 A holokauszt Magyarországon: A deportálások leállítása] (in Hungarian. Retrieved 11 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently pleaded with Horthy to use his influence to stop the deportations. Roosevelt specifically threatened military retaliation if the transports were not ceased.  On 2 July 1944 Horthy put down a coup attempt by [[Arrow Cross Party|Hungarists]] by using loyal forces. Thereby he temporarily neutralized the men who planned to deport Jews. This enabled Horthy to issue the order halting deportations on 7 July. The transports halted.&lt;ref&gt;Tsvi Erez, &quot;Hungary—Six Days in July 1944.&quot; ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies'' 3.1 (1988): 37–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szabolcs Szita, ''Trading in Lives?'' (Central European University Press, Budapest, 2005), pp. 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, 437,000 Jews had been sent to Auschwitz, most of them to their deaths.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; Horthy was informed about the number of the deported Jews some days later: &quot;approximately 400,000&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ilona/&gt; By many estimates, one of every three people murdered at Auschwitz during its operation was a Hungarian Jew killed between May and July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Alec, Picturing Auschwitz, New Yorker Magazine, 17 March 2008. pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains some uncertainty over how much Horthy knew about the number of Hungarian Jews being deported, their destination, and their intended fate – and when he knew it as well as what he could have done about it. According to historian Péter Sipos, the Hungarian government had already known about the Jewish genocide since 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Péter Sipos, [http://www.tankonyvtar.hu/hu/tartalom/historia/94-04/ch11.html Horthy Miklós és Magyarország német megszállása], História (volume 04), 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians{{who|date=August 2011}} have argued that Horthy believed that the Jews were being sent to the [[concentration camp|camps]] to work, and that they would be returned to Hungary after the war.&lt;ref name=Ilona&gt;Ilona Edelsheim-Gyulai, Becsület és kötelesség, part I, page 264. Európa press, [[Budapest]], 2001. {{ISBN|963-07-6544-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horthy himself wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Not before August,&quot; he wrote, &quot;did secret information reach me of the horrible truth about the extermination camps.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; The [[Vrba-Wetzler Report|Vrba-Wetzler statement]] is believed to have been passed to Hungarian [[Zionism|Zionist]] leader [[Rudolf Kastner]] no later than 28 April 1944, Kastner did not make it public.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, ''Auschwitz and the Allies: A Devastating Account of How the Allies Responded to the News of Hitler's Mass Murder'' (1981) pp=201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; He made an agreement with the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] to remain silent in order to save the Jews who escaped on the [[Kastner train]]. The &quot;Kastner train&quot;, a convoy that enabled Hungarian Jews to escape to Switzerland, left Budapest on 30 June 1944.

===Deposition and arrest===
{{main|Operation Panzerfaust|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}
In August 1944, [[King Michael's Coup|Romania withdrew from the Axis]] and turned on Hitler and his allies. This development, a sign of the failing German war effort, led Horthy in Budapest to reconsolidate his political position.  He ousted Sztójay and the other Nazi-friendly ministers installed the preceding spring, replacing them with a new government under [[Géza Lakatos]].  He stopped the mass deportations of Jews and ordered the police to use deadly force if the Germans attempted to resume them.  While some smaller groups continued to be deported by train, the Germans did not press Horthy to ramp the pace back up to pre-August levels.  Indeed, when Horthy turned down Eichmann's request to restart the deportations, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered Eichmann to return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robert J. Hanyok|title=Eavesdropping on Hell: Historical Guide to Western Communications Intelligence and the Holocaust, 1939–1945|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nsarep.pdf|publisher=NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, UNITED STATES CRYPTOLOGIC HISTORY|year=2004|quote=In late July there was a lull in the deportations. After the failed attempt on Hitler's life, the Germans backed off from pressing Horthy's regime to continue further, large-scale deportations. Smaller groups continued to be deported by train. At least one German police message decoded by GC&amp;CS revealed that one trainload of 1,296 Jews from the town of Sarvar in western Hungary Hungarian Jews being rounded up in Budapest (Courtesy: USHMM) had departed for Auschwitz on August 4.112 In late August Horthy refused Eichmann's request to restart the deportations. Himmler ordered Eichmann to leave Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing that Hungary's position was untenable, Horthy also renewed peace feelers to the Allies and began considering strategies for surrendering to the Allied force he distrusted the most: the Red Army.  Although Horthy was still bitterly anti-Communist, his dealings with the Nazis led him to conclude that the Soviets were the far lesser evil.  Working through his trustworthy General [[Béla Miklós]], who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Horthy sought to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the Hungarian government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this, and on 11 October Horthy and the Soviets finally agreed to surrender terms.  On 15 October 1944, Horthy told his government ministers that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. He said, &quot;It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;williamson&quot;/&gt; Horthy &quot;...informed a representative of the German Reich that we were about to conclude a military armistice with our former enemies and to cease all hostilities against them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

The Nazis had anticipated Horthy's move. On 15 October, after Horthy announced the armistice in a nationwide radio address, Hitler initiated [[Operation Panzerfaust]], sending commando [[Otto Skorzeny]] to Budapest with instructions to remove Horthy from power.  Horthy's son [[Miklós Horthy, Jr.]], was meeting with Soviet representatives to finalize the surrender when Skorzeny and his troops forced their way into the meeting and kidnapped the younger Horthy at gunpoint. Trussed up in a carpet, Miklós Jr. was immediately driven to the airport and flown to Germany to serve as a hostage. Skorzeny then brazenly led a convoy of German troops and four [[Tiger II]] tanks to the Vienna Gates of [[Buda Castle|Castle Hill]], where the Hungarians had been ordered not to resist. Though one unit had not received the order, the Germans quickly captured Castle Hill with minimal bloodshed; seven soldiers were killed and twenty-six wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;williamson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |title=War and Game: Operation Panzerfaust |last=Williamson |first=Mitch |accessdate=16 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072245/http://warandgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/operation-panzerfaust.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horthy was captured by Veesenmayer and his staff later on the 15th and taken to the Waffen SS office, where he was held overnight. Veesenmayer told Horthy that unless he recanted the armistice and abdicated, his son would be killed the next morning.  The fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]] swiftly took over Budapest.  With his son's life in the balance, Horthy consented to sign a document officially abdicating his office and naming [[Ferenc Szálasi]], leader of the Arrow Cross, as both head of state and prime minister.  Horthy understood that the Germans merely wanted the stamp of his prestige on a Nazi-sponsored Arrow Cross coup, but he signed anyway. As he later explained his capitulation: &quot;I neither resigned nor appointed Szálasi Premier. I merely exchanged my signature for my son's life. A signature wrung from a man at machine-gun point can have little legality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

Horthy met Skorzeny three days later at Pfeffer-Wildenbruch's apartment and was told he would be transported to Germany in his own special train. Skorzeny told Horthy that he would be a &quot;guest of honour&quot; in a secure Bavarian castle. On 17 October, Horthy was personally escorted by Skorzeny into captivity&lt;ref name=&quot;williamson&quot;/&gt; at {{interlanguage link|Schloss Hirschberg am Haarsee|de}} in [[Bavaria]], where he was guarded closely, but allowed to live in comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

With the help of the SS, the Arrow Cross leadership moved swiftly to take command of the Hungarian armed forces, and to prevent the surrender that Horthy had arranged, even though Soviet troops were now deep inside the country. Szálasi resumed persecution of Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot;. In the three months between November 1944 and January 1945, Arrow Cross death squads shot 10,000 to 15,000 Jews on the banks of the [[Danube]]. The Arrow Cross also welcomed Adolf Eichmann back to Budapest, where he began the deportation of the city's surviving Jews. Eichmann never successfully completed this phase of his plans, thwarted in large measure by the efforts of Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]]. Out of a pre-war Hungarian Jewish population estimated at 825,000, only 260,000 survived.

By December 1944, Budapest was under siege by Soviet forces. The Arrow Cross leadership retreated across the Danube into the hills of Buda in late January, and by February the city surrendered to the Soviet forces.

Horthy remained under house arrest in Bavaria until the war in Europe ended. On 29 April, his SS guardians fled in the face of the Allied advance. On 1 May, Horthy was first liberated, and then arrested, by elements of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. 7th Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

==Exile==
After his arrest, Horthy was moved through a variety of detention locations before finally arriving at the prison facility at [[Nuremberg]] in late September 1945. There he was asked to provide evidence to the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in preparation for the trial of the Nazi leadership. Although he was interviewed repeatedly about his contacts with some of the defendants, he did not testify in person. In Nuremberg he was reunited with his son, Miklós Jr.

Horthy gradually came to believe that his arrest had been arranged and choreographed by the Americans in order to protect him from the Russians. Indeed, the former regent reported being told that [[Josip Broz Tito]], the new ruler of Yugoslavia, asked that Horthy be charged with complicity with the 1942 [[Novi Sad raid]] by Hungarian troops in the [[Bačka]] region of [[Vojvodina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; Serbian historian Zvonimir Golubović has claimed that not only was Horthy aware of these genocidal massacres, but had approved of them.&lt;ref&gt;Zvonimir Golubović, Racija u Južnoj Bačkoj, 1942. godine, Novi Sad, 1991. (page 194)&lt;/ref&gt; American trial officials did not indict Horthy for war crimes. The former ambassador [[John Flournoy Montgomery|John Montgomery]], who had some influence in Washington, also contributed to Horthy's release in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tibor Frank|authorlink=Tibor Frank|title=Discussing Hitler: Advisers of U.S. Diplomacy in Central Europe, 1934–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjykRtYJHkcC&amp;pg=PP4|year=2003|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9241-56-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the memoirs of [[Ferenc Nagy]], who served for a year as prime minister in post-war Hungary, the Hungarian Communist leadership was also interested in extraditing Horthy for trial. Nagy said that [[Joseph Stalin]] was more forgiving: that Stalin told Nagy during a diplomatic meeting in April 1945 not to judge Horthy, because he was old and had offered an armistice in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Nagy's 1948 memoirs, ''The Struggle Behind the Iron Curtain'', are quoted in Andrew Simon's annotations to Horthy's ''Memoirs'', in this case for Chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 1945, Horthy was released from Nuremberg prison and allowed to rejoin his family in the German town of [[Weilheim in Oberbayern|Weilheim]], [[Bavaria]]. The Horthys lived there for four years, supported financially by ambassador John Montgomery, his successor, [[Herbert Pell]], and by [[Pope Pius XII]], whom he knew personally.

In March 1948, Horthy returned to testify at the [[Ministries Trial]], the last of the twelve U.S.-run Nuremberg Trials; he testified against [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], the Nazi administrator who had controlled Hungary during the deportations to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt; Veesenmayer was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, but was released in 1951.

For Horthy, returning to Hungary was impossible; it was now firmly in the hands of a Soviet-sponsored Communist government. In an extraordinary twist of fate, the chief of Hungary's post-war Communist apparatus was [[Mátyás Rákosi]], one of [[Béla Kun]]'s colleagues from the ill-fated Communist coup of 1919. Kun had been executed during Stalin's purges of the late 1930s, but Rákosi had survived in a Hungarian prison cell; in 1940 Horthy had permitted Rákosi to emigrate to the Soviet Union in exchange for a series of highly symbolic Hungarian battle-flags from the 19th century that were in Russian hands.

In 1950, the Horthy family managed to find a home in Portugal, thanks to Miklós Jr.'s contacts with Portuguese diplomats in Switzerland. Horthy and members of his family were relocated to the seaside town of [[Estoril]], in the house address Rua Dom Afonso Henriques, 1937 2765.573 Estoril.
His American supporter, John Montgomery, recruited a small group of wealthy Hungarians to raise funds for their upkeep in exile. According to Horthy's daughter-in-law, Countess Ilona Edelsheim Gyulai, Hungarian Jews also supported Horthy's family in exile,&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank&quot;/&gt; including industrialist Ferenc Chorin and lawyer László Pathy.&lt;ref&gt;From the [http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&amp;bookid=9&amp;post=1 ''Annotated Memoirs of Admiral Miklós Horthy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814231438/http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&amp;bookid=9&amp;post=1 |date=14 August 2014 }} (accessed 2009 September 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

In exile, Horthy wrote his memoirs, ''Ein Leben für Ungarn'' (English: ''A Life for Hungary''), published under the name of Nikolaus von Horthy, in which he narrated many personal experiences from his youth until the end of World War II. He claimed that he had distrusted Hitler for much of the time he knew him and tried to perform the best actions and appoint the best officials in his country. He also highlighted Hungary's mistreatment by many other countries since the end of World War I. Horthy was one of the few Axis heads of state to survive the war, and thus to write post-war memoirs.

Horthy never lost his deep contempt for communism, and in his memoirs he blamed Hungary's alliance with the Axis on the threat posed by the &quot;Asiatic barbarians&quot; of the Soviet Union. He railed against the influence that the Allies' victory had given to Stalin's totalitarian state.  &quot;I feel no urge to say 'I told you so,' &quot; Horthy wrote, &quot;nor to express bitterness at the experiences that have been forced upon me. Rather, I feel wonder and amazement at the vagaries of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;horthy&quot;/&gt;

He died in 1957 in [[Estoril]].

Horthy married [[Magdolna Purgly|Magdolna Purgly de Jószáshely]] in 1901; they were married for just over 56 years, until his death. He had two sons, [[Miklós Horthy, Jr.]] (often rendered in English as &quot;Nicholas&quot; or &quot;Nikolaus&quot;) and [[István Horthy]], who served as his political assistants; and two daughters, Magda and Paula. Of his four children, only Miklós outlived him.

According to footnotes in his memoirs, Horthy was very distraught about the failure of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. In his will, Horthy asked that his body not be returned to Hungary &quot;until the last Russian soldier has left.&quot; His heirs honoured the request. In 1993, two years after the Soviet troops left Hungary, Horthy's body was returned to Hungary and he was buried in his home town of [[Kenderes]]. The reburial in Hungary was the subject of some controversy on part of the left.&lt;ref&gt;Perlez, Jane, '&quot;Reburial is Both a Ceremony and a Test for Today's Hungary,&quot; ''The New York Times'', 5 September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to [[silicosis]], [[bronchitis]], or [[lung cancer]], as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates the tissue, reducing lung capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.silica-safe.org/|title=Work Safely with Silica|publisher=CPWR - The Center for Construction Research and Training|access-date=11 Feb 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fine silica particles are inhaled in large enough quantities (such as through occupational exposure), it increases the risk of [[systemic autoimmune disease]]s such as [[lupus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niams.nih.gov/about/working-groups/lupus-federal/action-plan|title=Action Plan for Lupus Research|date=2017|website=[[National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|NIAMS]]|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]|access-date=11 Feb 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] compared to expected rates in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Meyer A, Sandler DP, Beane Freeman LE, Hofmann JN, Parks CG|date=2017|title=Pesticide Exposure and Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis among Licensed Male Pesticide Applicators in the Agricultural Health Study|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives|Environ.

===Occupational hazard===

Silica is an occupational hazard for people who do [[Abrasive blasting|sandblasting]], or work with products that contain powdered crystalline silica. Amorphous silica, such as fumed silica, may cause irreversible lung damage in some cases, but is not associated with development of silicosis. Children, asthmatics of any age, those with allergies, and the elderly (all of whom have reduced lung capacity) can be affected in less time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Reuzel PG, Bruijntjes JP, Feron VJ, Woutersen RA|year=1991|title=Subchronic inhalation toxicity of amorphous silicas and quartz dust in rats|journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology|Food Chem.

Crystalline silica is an occupational hazard for those working with stone [[countertop]]s, because the process of cutting and installing the countertops creates large amounts of airborne silica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2015-106/pdfs/2015-106.pdf|title=Worker Exposure to Silica during Countertop Manufacturing, Finishing and Installation|date=2015|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]|access-date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystalline silica used in [[hydraulic fracturing]] presents a health hazard to workers.&lt;ref name=NYT82313/&gt;

===Pathophysiology===
In the body, crystalline silica particles do not dissolve over clinically relevant periods. Silica crystals inside the lungs can activate the NLRP3 [[inflammasome]] inside macrophages and dendritic cells and thereby result in production of [[interleukin]], a highly [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]] in the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Hornung V, Bauernfeind F, Halle A, Samstad EO, Kono H, Rock KL, Fitzgerald KA, Latz E|year=2008|title=Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization|journal=[[Nature Immunology|Nat.

===Regulation===
Regulations restricting silica exposure 'with respect to the silicosis hazard' specify that they are concerned only with silica, which is both crystalline and dust-forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/crystalline-factsheet.pdf|title=Crystalline Factsheet|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/silicacrystalline/|access-date=3 August 2017|title=Silica, Crystalline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silica-safe.org/ask-a-question/faq|access-date=3 August 2017|title=Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.uconn.edu/Word%20Docs/Silica%20fact%20sheet.pdf|access-date=3 August 2017|title=If It's Silica, It's Not Just Dust!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osha.oregon.gov/OSHAPubs/3301.pdf|access-date=3 August 2017|title=What you should know about crystalline silica, silicosis, and Oregon OSHA silica rules.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szymendera|first1=Scott D.|title=Respirable Crystalline Silica in the Workplace: New Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards|date=January 16, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44476.pdf|access-date=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] reduced the exposure limit to 50 [[micrograms|µg]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air. Prior to 2013, it had allowed 100 &amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and in construction workers even 250&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=NYT82313 /&gt;
In 2013, OSHA also required &quot;green completion&quot; of fracked wells to reduce exposure to crystalline silica besides restricting the limit of exposure.&lt;ref name=NYT82313/&gt;

==Crystalline forms==
SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, more so than almost any material, exists in many crystalline forms. These forms are called [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]].

[[File:Nichols radiometer.png|thumb|300px|right|Figures 1 and 2 in ''A Preliminary communication on the pressure of heat and light radiation'', Phys. Rev. 13, 307-320 (1901).]]
A '''Nichols radiometer''' was the apparatus used by [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] and [[Gordon Ferrie Hull]] in 1901 for the measurement of [[radiation pressure]]. It consisted of a pair of small silvered glass [[mirror]]s suspended in the manner of a [[torsion balance]] by a fine [[quartz]] fibre within an enclosure in which the air pressure could be regulated. The torsion head to which the fiber was attached could be turned from the outside using a [[magnet]]. A beam of [[light]] was directed first on one mirror and then on the other, and the opposite deflections observed with mirror and scale. By turning the mirror system around to receive the light on the unsilvered side, the influence of the air in the enclosure could be ascertained. This influence was found to be of almost negligible value at an air pressure of about 16 [[torr|mmHg]] (2.1 [[kilopascal|kPa]]). The radiant energy of the incident beam was deduced from its heating effect upon a small blackened silver disk, which was found to be more reliable than the [[bolometer]] when it was first used. With this apparatus, the experimenters were able to obtain an agreement between observed and computed radiation pressures within about 0.6%. The original apparatus is at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2008-10th-anniversary-edition/what-else-has-happened-a-celebration-of-the-legacy-of-physics-at-dartmouth|title=A Celebration of the Legacy of Physics at Dartmouth  |last=Lee|first=Dillon |year=2008|work=Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This apparatus is sometimes confused with the [[Crookes radiometer]] of 1873.

'''Parsis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|s|iː}}) or '''Parsees''' (which means '[[Persian people|Persian]]' in the [[Persian language]]) are an [[ethnoreligious group]] who migrated to the [[Indian subcontinent]] from [[Persia]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] of CE 636–651; one of two such groups (the other being [[Irani (India)|Iranis]]). [[Zoroastrianism]] is the [[ethnic religion]] of the Parsi people. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', Parsis migrated from the [[Sasanian Empire]] to [[Gujarat]], where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century CE to avoid [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}}{{sfn|Boyce|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Lambton|1981|p=205}}{{sfn|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}{{sfn|Khanbaghi|2006|p=17}}&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1906|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|Widengren|1971|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the [[Sasanian Empire]]) was [[Zoroastrianism]]. Iranians such as [[Babak Khorramdin]] rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|last1=Akram|first1=A.

The word {{lang|fa|پارسیان}}, pronounced &quot;Pārsiān&quot;, i.e., &quot;Pārsi&quot; in the [[Persian language]], literally means ''Persian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138161 Parsee, n. and adj. - Oxford English Dictionary]. oed.com. Retrieved on 2015-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that ''Farsi'' is an [[Arabization]] of the word ''Parsi'', which is used as an [[endonym]] of Persian, and the Persian language is spoken in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and some other regions of the former [[Persian Empire]].

The long presence of the Parsis in India distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=Kamala|date=2008|title=Intra-community Dissent and Dialogue: The Bombay Parsis and the Zoroastrian Diaspora|journal=Sociological Bulletin|volume=57|issue=3|pages=315–336|doi=10.1177/0038022920080301|jstor=23620804|s2cid=148248437}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.L.

According to P.K.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]]. The Parsis, whose name means &quot;Persians&quot;, are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities nearby in Karachi (Pakistan) and Chennai. There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Bangalore. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Hyderabad. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the [[Persian Gulf]] but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may, in fact, have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at [[Diu, India|Diu]] in [[Kathiawar]] but soon moved to South Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444672/Parsi Parsi (people) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Pārsi'', which in the Persian language is a [[demonym]] meaning &quot;inhabitant of [[Fars Province|Pārs]]&quot; and hence &quot;ethnic Persian&quot;, is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms ''Zartoshti'' &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; or ''Vehdin'' &quot;[of] the good religion&quot;. The 12th-century ''Sixteen [[Shloka]]s'', a [[Sanskrit]] text in praise of the Parsis,&lt;ref&gt;Parsi legend attributes it to a Hindu author; [[cf.]] {{Harvard citation no brackets|Paymaster|1954|p=8}} incorrectly attributes the text to a Zoroastrian priest&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.

[[File:Indian - Leaf from Bound Collection of 20 Miniatures Depicting Village Life - Walters 35176H.jpg|thumb|Parsis from India, c. 1870]]
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, [[Jordanus]], briefly refers to their presence in [[Thane]] and [[Bharuch]]. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician [[Garcia de Orta]] observed in 1563 that &quot;there are merchants ... in the kingdom of [[Khambhat|Cambaia]] ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are [[Gentile|Gentios]].&quot; In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see [[#Self-perceptions|self-perceptions]], below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that &quot;Parsi&quot; was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}}{{sfn|Boyce|2002|p=105}} notes that in much the same way as the word &quot;Hindu&quot; was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, &quot;Parsi&quot; was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term &quot;Parsi&quot; itself is &quot;not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity&quot;.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I. 373}} Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as [[Parthia]]ns according to the ''Qissa-i Sanjan''.{{sfn|Boyce|2002|p=105}}

The term &quot;Parseeism&quot; or &quot;Parsiism&quot; is attributed to [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], who in the 1750s, when the word &quot;Zoroastrianism&quot; had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the term &quot;Parsi&quot; existed even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Parsis is found in the Assyrian inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] (circa 854-824 BC).
* [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, “parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra”, meaning, “a Parsi, the son of a Parsi, an [[Aryan]], of Aryan family (Inscription at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]], near [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]).
* In Outlines of Parsi History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3-4 writes, “According to the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of [[Karnamak-i Ardeshir-i Papakan|Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan]], the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan ‘the king of the Parsis’.
* [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC referred to Iranians as Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani (1966) 68 Bom. L.R. 794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good ([[Ohrmazd]]) and evil ([[Angra Mainyu]]) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the ''[[asha]]'' or the righteousness and ''[[druj]]'' or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the [[Chinvat bridge]] to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the ''Avesta'', was written in the [[Avestan language]], which is closely related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

The ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a [[fire temple]].

=== As an ethnic community ===
[[Image:Parsi wedding portrait with Dastur MN Dhalla.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding portrait, 1948]]
Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of [[consanguinity]] or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. &lt;!-- religion, and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] --&gt;
[[Genealogical DNA test]]s to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention{{sfn|Nanavutty|1970|p=13}} that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome]] (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of [[Pakistan]], it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours.{{sfn|Qamar|Ayub|Mohyuddin|Helgason|2002| p=1119}}

A 2004 study in which Parsi [[mitochondrial DNA]] (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested &quot;a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin&quot;.{{sfn|Quintana-Murci|Chaix|Wells|Behar|2004|p=840}} A study was conducted in 2017 which found that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East and that there were “48% South-Asian-specific mitochondrial lineages among the ancient samples, which might have resulted from the assimilation of local females during the initial settlement.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9| title=&quot;Like sugar in milk&quot;: Reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population| year=2017| last1=Chaubey| first1=Gyaneshwer| last2=Ayub| first2=Qasim| last3=Rai| first3=Niraj| last4=Prakash| first4=Satya| last5=Mushrif-Tripathy| first5=Veena| last6=Mezzavilla| first6=Massimo| last7=Pathak| first7=Ajai Kumar| last8=Tamang| first8=Rakesh| last9=Firasat| first9=Sadaf| last10=Reidla| first10=Maere| last11=Karmin| first11=Monika| last12=Rani| first12=Deepa Selvi| last13=Reddy| first13=Alla G.| last14=Parik| first14=Jüri| last15=Metspalu| first15=Ene| last16=Rootsi| first16=Siiri| last17=Dalal| first17=Kurush| last18=Khaliq| first18=Shagufta| last19=Mehdi| first19=Syed Qasim| last20=Singh| first20=Lalji| last21=Metspalu| first21=Mait| last22=Kivisild| first22=Toomas| last23=Tyler-Smith| first23=Chris| last24=Villems| first24=Richard| last25=Thangaraj| first25=Kumarasamy| journal=Genome Biology| volume=18| issue=1| page=110| pmid=28615043| pmc=5470188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-perceptions ===
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the [[navjote]] ceremony.

In this sense, ''Parsi'' is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]] in the West.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of [[gender equality]] and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

{{quote|the Parsi community consists of: a) Parsis who are descended from the original Persian emigrants and who are born of both Zoroastrian parents and who profess the Zoroastrian religion; b) Iranis [here meaning [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], not the other group of Indian Zoroastrians] professing the Zoroastrian religion; c) the children of Parsi fathers by alien mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.{{sfn|Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit v. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhai|1909}}}}

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] void the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948.{{sfn|Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar v. Merwan Rashid Yezdiar|1948}} On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an [[obiter dictum]] – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966).{{sfn|Merwan Rashid Yezdiar v. Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar|1950}}{{sfn|Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani|1966}})

There is a growing voice within the community that if indeed equality must be re-established then the only acceptable solution is to allow a child to be initiated into the faith only if both parents are Parsi.

Nonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration.{{sfn|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=21}} A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest&lt;!-- infant mortality is the other possibility, but is negligible among Parsis--&gt;: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals.{{sfn|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=14}} Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02wmp5q|title=Saving India's Parsis|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high [[literacy rate]]; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in [[urban area]]s (the national average is 27.8%). Parsis mother tongue is [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. 

In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.{{sfn|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=18, 19}}

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian sub-continent ===
According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]], the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This historical region of [[Central Asia]] is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern [[Khorasan Province]], part of western/northern [[Afghanistan]], and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

According to the ''Qissa'', the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, [[Jadi Rana]], on the condition that they adopt the local language ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]) and that their women adopt local dress (the ''[[sari]]'').{{sfn|Hodivala|1920}} The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ([[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]], near [[Merv]], modern Turkmenistan).{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the ''alat''). In addition to these ''Khorasani''s or ''Kohistani''s &quot;mountain folk&quot;, as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called,{{sfn|Vimadalal|1979|p=2}} at least one other group is said to have come overland from [[Sari, Iran]].{{sfn|Paymaster|1954}}

He was soon deposed in a [[1991–92 Georgian coup d'état|bloody ''coup d'état'']], from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guards and a paramilitary organization called &quot;[[Mkhedrioni]]&quot; (&quot;horsemen&quot;). The country became embroiled in a bitter [[Georgian Civil War|civil war]], which lasted until nearly 1995. [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1985 to 1991) returned to Georgia in 1992 and joined the leaders of the coup—[[Tengiz Kitovani]] and [[Jaba Ioseliani]]—to head a triumvirate called &quot;The State Council&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2003, Shevardnadze (who won re-election in 2000) was deposed by the [[Rose Revolution]], after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that 2 November parliamentary elections were marred by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav112204a.shtml |title=EurasiaNet Eurasia Insight – Georgia's Rose Revolution: Momentum and Consolidation |publisher=Eurasianet.org |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074544/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav112204a.shtml |archive-date=5 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution was led by [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], [[Zurab Zhvania]] and [[Nino Burjanadze]], former members and leaders of Shevardnadze's ruling party.

Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of [[Ajaria]] led to a major [[Ajaria Crisis|crisis]] early in 2004. Success in Ajaria encouraged Saakashvili to intensify his efforts, but without success, in breakaway South Ossetia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Georgia (country)}}
Georgia is a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[parliamentary]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Georgia|President]] as the head of state, and Prime Minister as the head of government. The executive branch of power is made up of the [[Cabinet of Georgia]]. The Cabinet is composed of ministers, headed by the [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]], and appointed by the President. [[Salome Zurabishvili]] is the current President of Georgia after winning 59.52% of the vote in the [[Georgian presidential election, 2018|2018 Georgian presidential election]].

[[File:Parliament of Georgia in Kutaisi.jpg|thumb|Georgian parliament building in Kutaisi]]
[[Legislature|Legislative]] authority is vested in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. It is unicameral and has 150 members, known as deputies, of whom 73 are elected by plurality to represent single-member districts, and 77 are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation. Members of parliament are elected for four-year terms. On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated a new Parliament building in the western city of [[Kutaisi]], in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211070227/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 December 2018 |title=Georgia opens new parliament in Kutaisi, far from the capital |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 May 2012 |access-date=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|elections in October 2012]] resulted in the victory for the opposition &quot;[[Georgian Dream|Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia]]&quot; [[Coalition#Politics and government|coalition]], which President Saakashvili acknowledged on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Saakashvili Concedes Defeat in Parliamentary Election|newspaper=Civil|date=2 October 2012|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130107143326/http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25299|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Different opinions exist regarding the degree of political freedom in Georgia. Saakashvili believed in 2008 that the country is &quot;on the road to becoming a European democracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=misha&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia Leader: Country on Right Track |publisher=Fox News |date=7 January 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0,4670,GeorgiaPresidentialElection,00.html |access-date=17 October 2008 |first=Lynn |last=Berry |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108095512/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan07/0%2C4670%2CGeorgiaPresidentialElection%2C00.html |archive-date=8 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]] lists Georgia as a partly free country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2008 |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |access-date=23 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131211403/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fiw/FIW_2011_Booklet.pdf |archive-date=31 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for 2012 parliamentary elections, Parliament adopted a new electoral code on 27 December 2011 that incorporated many recommendations from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Venice Commission. However, the new code failed to address the Venice Commission's primary recommendation to strengthen the equality of the vote by reconstituting single-mandate election districts to be comparable in size. On 28 December, Parliament amended the Law on Political Unions to regulate campaign and political party financing. Local and international observers raised concerns about several amendments, including the vagueness of the criteria for determining political bribery and which individuals and organizations would be subject to the law. {{as of|2012|March|}}, Parliament was discussing further amendments to address these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5253.htm |title=Georgia |publisher=State.gov |date=2 April 2012 |access-date=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing U.S. and European Union influence in Georgia, notably through proposed EU and NATO membership, the U.S. [[Georgia Train and Equip Program|Train and Equip]] military assistance program, and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] have frequently strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow. Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080812234954/http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=8271 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 August 2008 |title=U.S. Announces New Military Assistance Program for Georgia |publisher=Civil.Ge |date=1 July 2001 |access-date=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia is currently working to become a full member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]. In August 2004, the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia was submitted officially to NATO. On 29 October 2004, the [[North Atlantic Council]] of NATO approved the [[NATO#International Partnership Action Plans|Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) of Georgia, and Georgia moved on to the second stage of Euro–Atlantic Integration. In 2005, by the decision of the President of Georgia, a state commission was set up to implement the Individual Partnership Action Plan, which presents an interdepartmental group headed by the Prime Minister. The commission was tasked with coordinating and controlling the implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

On 14 February 2005, the agreement on the appointment of [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) liaison officer between Georgia and NATO came into force, whereby a liaison officer for the South Caucasus was assigned to Georgia. On 2 March 2005, the agreement was signed on the provision of the host nation support to and transit of NATO forces and NATO personnel. On 6–9 March 2006, the IPAP implementation interim assessment team arrived in Tbilisi.

In Georgia, law enforcement is conducted and provided for by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies. New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police'. Intelligence collecting in the interests of national security is now the remit of the [[Georgian Intelligence Service]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Adjara]] under local strongman [[Aslan Abashidze]] maintained close ties with Russia and allowed a Russian military base to be maintained in Batumi. Upon the election of Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004 tensions rose between Abashidze and the Georgian government, leading to demonstrations in Adjara and the resignation and flight of Abashidze. The region retains autonomy, and as a sign of Ajaria's reconnection with the central Georgian government, the Georgian Constitutional Court was moved from T'bilisi to Batumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3520322.stm | work=BBC News | title=Regions and territories: Ajaria | date=8 February 2011 | access-date=31 January 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202033946/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3520322.stm | archive-date=2 February 2014 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bisected by the Caucasus Mountains; the area north of the Greater Caucasus range is called Ciscaucasia and the region to the south Transcaucasia.

Because of a complex geographic setting, mountains also isolate the northern region of [[Svaneti]] from the rest of Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Greater Caucasus|Greater Caucasus Mountain Range]] forms the northern border of Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The main roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between [[Shida Kartli]] and North Ossetia and the [[Darial Gorge]] (in the Georgian region of [[Khevi]]). The Roki Tunnel was vital for the Russian military in the [[2008 Russo-Georgian War]] because it is the only direct route through the Caucasus Mountains. The southern portion of the country is bounded by the [[Lesser Caucasus|Lesser Caucasus Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range is much higher in elevation than the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, with the highest peaks rising more than {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount [[Shkhara]] at {{convert|5068|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and the second highest is Mount Janga ([[Dzhangi–Tau]]) at {{convert|5059|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Other prominent peaks include [[Mount Kazbek]] at {{convert|5047|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Shota Rustaveli {{convert|4860|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Tetnuldi {{convert|4858|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, [[Ushba]] {{convert|4700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Ailama]] {{convert|4547|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; Out of the abovementioned peaks, only Kazbek is of [[volcanic]] origin. The region between [[Kazbek]] and Shkhara (a distance of about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers. Out of the 2,100 glaciers that exist in the Caucasus today, approximately [[Glaciers of Georgia|30% are located within Georgia]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:268A5992 HDR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tusheti]] region in northeast Georgia]]

The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cac&quot;/&gt; The area can be split into two separate sub-regions; the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run parallel to the Greater Caucasus Range, and the [[Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland]], which lies immediately to the south of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed {{convert|3400|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the [[Javakheti Volcanic Plateau]], lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major [[List of rivers of Georgia (country)|rivers in Georgia]] are the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] and the [[Mtkvari River|Mtkvari]]. The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[Krubera Cave]] is the deepest known cave in the world. It is located in the [[Arabika Massif]] of the [[Gagra Range]], in Abkhazia. In 2001, a Russian–Ukrainian team had set the world depth record for a cave at {{convert|1710|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. In 2004, the penetrated depth was increased on each of three expeditions, when a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team crossed the {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} mark for the first time in the history of [[speleology]]. In October 2005, an unexplored part was found by the CAVEX team, further increasing the known depth of the cave. This expedition confirmed the known depth of the cave at {{convert|2140|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Topography ===
[[File:Physical Map of Georgia (en).svg|thumb|Physical map of Georgia]]
The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied. Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and [[temperate rainforest]]s to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of [[semi-arid]] plains. Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the [[alpine tundra|alpine]]/[[subalpine zone]] accounts for roughly around 10 percent of the land.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of the [[agricultural development]] of the land and [[urbanization]]. The large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (e.g. [[Lake Paliastomi]] area). At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains. Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and contain species such as [[oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[Oriental Beech|beech]], [[elm]], [[ash tree|ash]], and [[Sweet Chestnut|chestnut]]. Evergreen species such as [[Buxus|box]] may also be found in many areas. Ca. 1000 of all 4000 higher plants of Georgia are [[endemic]] to this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endemic-species-caucasus.info/ |title=Endemic Species of the Caucasus |publisher=Endemic-species-caucasus.info |date=7 January 2009 |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412080946/http://www.endemic-species-caucasus.info/ |archive-date=12 April 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vardzia and Mtkvari valley, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|View of the cave city of [[Vardzia]] and the valley of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] below]]

The west-central slopes of the [[Meskheti Range]] in [[Ajaria]] as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by [[temperate rain forests]]. Between {{convert|600|-|1000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life. The zone is made up mainly of beech, [[Caucasian Spruce|spruce]], and [[Nordmann Fir|fir]] forests. From {{convert|1500|-|1800|m|ft|0}}, the forest becomes largely coniferous. The tree line generally ends at around {{convert|1800|m|ft|0}} and the alpine zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the 3,000-metre line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the [[Likhi Range]]) is considerably different from that of the west, although, much like the Colchis plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the [[Mtkvari]] and [[Alazani]] River plains have been [[deforestation|deforested]] for agricultural purposes. In addition, because of the region's relatively drier climate, some of the low-lying plains (especially in Kartli and south-eastern Kakheti) were never covered by forests in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains. In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 percent of the forests of the region are deciduous. Coniferous forests only dominate in the [[Borjomi Gorge]] and in the extreme western areas. Out of the deciduous species of trees, [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[hornbeam]] dominate. Other deciduous species include several varieties of [[maple]], [[aspen]], ash, and [[hazelnut]]. The Upper Alazani River Valley contains [[Taxus baccata|yew]] forests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

At higher elevations above {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (particularly in the [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], and [[Khevi]] regions), [[Scots Pine|pine]] and [[birch]] forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between {{convert|500|-|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with the alpine zone extending from 2,000–2,300 to 3,000–3,500 metres (6,562–7,546 to 9,843–11,483&amp;nbsp;ft). The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the [[Alazani]] Valley of Kakheti. The eternal snow and glacier zone lies above the {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|adj=on}} line in most areas of eastern Georgia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Georgia (country)}}
The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size. There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

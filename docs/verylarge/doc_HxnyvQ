===Music===
Shortly after his death, several songs in tribute to Valentino, including &quot;There's a New Star in Heaven Tonight&quot; and one by his first wife, Jean Acker, titled &quot;We Will Meet at the End of the Trail&quot;, became bestsellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;embezzler&quot; /&gt; In 1964, [[Freddie Hart]] recorded a ballad titled &quot;Valentino.&quot;

Goodall is also honorary member of the [[World Future Council]].

==Early years==
Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born in 1934 in [[Hampstead]], London,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Morris-Goodall, Valerie J&quot; in Register of Births for Hampstead Registration District, volume 1a (1934), p. 748.&lt;/ref&gt; to businessman Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall (1907–2001) and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph (1906–2000),&lt;ref&gt;''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916–2007''.&lt;/ref&gt; a novelist from [[Milford Haven]], [[Pembrokeshire]],&lt;ref&gt;''1911 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote under the name Vanne Morris-Goodall.&lt;ref name=&quot;JGBio&quot;/&gt;

The family later moved to [[Bournemouth]], and Goodall attended [[Uplands School, Poole|Uplands School]], an independent school in nearby [[Poole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JGBio&quot;/&gt;

As a child, as an alternative to a teddy bear, Goodall's father gave her a stuffed chimpanzee named Jubilee. Goodall has said her fondness for this figure started her early love of animals, commenting, &quot;My mother's friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.&quot; Today, Jubilee still sits on Goodall's dresser in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=Jane |author2=Phillip Berman |title=Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey |publisher=Warner Books |year=2000 |location=New York |page=4 |isbn=978-0-446-67613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the [[Kenya]] highlands in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;JanesStory&quot; /&gt; From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned [[Louis Leakey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jane Goodall Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=  https://www.achievement.org/achiever/jane-goodall/#interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early [[hominids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=June 2007 |title=Jane Goodall helps humans and animals live together |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07.html |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |location=[[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his co-researcher and wife, noted  British [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Mary Leakey]], Louis sent Goodall to [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanganyika]] (present-day [[Tanzania]]), where he laid out his plans.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with [[William Charles Osman Hill|Osman Hill]] and primate anatomy with [[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]].&lt;ref name=Morell1995&gt;{{cite book |last=Morell |first=Virginia |year=1995 |title=Ancestral Passions: the Leakey family and the quest for humankind's beginnings |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-80192-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ancestralpassion00more/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/ancestralpassion00more/page/242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to [[Gombe Stream National Park]], becoming the first of what would come to be called [[The Trimates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodallPeterson2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodall |first1=Jane |last2=Peterson |first2=Dale |title=Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters: The Later Years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kdr0TP7ou0wC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |date=25 September 2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-618-25734-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;JanesStory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Days |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/janes-story |accessdate=28 July 2010 |publisher=[[Jane Goodall Institute]] |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall credits her mother with encouraging her to pursue a career in [[primatology]], a male-dominated field at the time. Goodall has stated that women were not accepted in the field when she started her research in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Morgen, B.(Director).(2017). ''Jane'' [Motion Picture]. United States: National Geographic Studios&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the field of [[primatology]] is made up almost evenly of men and women, in part thanks to the trailblazing of Goodall and her encouragement of young women to join the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;''She Walks with Apes'', CBC/Radio Canada, www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/louis-leakey-selected-three-women-to-study-the-great-apes-they-inspire-youn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leakey arranged funding, and in 1962 he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to the [[University of Cambridge]]. She went to [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], and obtained a [[PhD]] in [[ethology]].&lt;ref name=goodphd/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JanesStory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Peterson|title=Jane Goodall: The Woman Who Redefined Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzJIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261|date=11 November 2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-52579-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD there without first having obtained a BA or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JGBio&quot; /&gt; Her thesis was completed in 1965 under the supervision of [[Robert Hinde]] on the ''Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees'',&lt;ref name=goodphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|first=Jane|last=Goodall|year=1966|title=Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.727585}}|oclc=1063634333|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/251039|website=repository.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;JGBio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae, Jane Goodall, PhD, DBE |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |url=http://www.janegoodall.org.hk/downloads/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005905/http://www.janegoodall.org.hk/downloads/Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2006 the Open university of Tanzania had the occasion of conferment of Honorary Degree presented to Dr. Jane Goodall for the award of the Doctor of Science degree [[honoris causa]] of the [[Open University of Tanzania]].

== Work ==

=== Research at Gombe Stream National Park ===
[[File:Jane Goodall, The Green Interview.webm|thumb|right|Goodall in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]], discussing her work]]
Goodall is best known for her study of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] social and family life. She began studying the [[Kasakela chimpanzee community]] in [[Gombe Stream National Park]], [[Tanzania]], in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Study Corner – Gombe Timeline |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-gombe-timeline |publisher=Jane Goodall Institute |year=2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; She found that &quot;it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees/introduction/1908/ |title=Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees |year=1996 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what we consider &quot;human&quot; actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of &quot;the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone and can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Goodall's research at Gombe Stream is best known to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively &quot;fishing&quot; for termites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot;&gt;Goodall, Jane. ''Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey''. New York: Warner Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as &quot;Man the Toolmaker&quot;. In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, &quot;We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janegoodall.org/study-corner-tool-use Tool Use]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot;&gt;The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp &quot;Chimpanzee Central&quot;], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as [[colobus]] monkeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree and block all possible exits; then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot; /&gt; The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodall&quot; /&gt; The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What chimpanzees do?|url=http://www.chimpanzoo.org/enrichment/Foraging-chimpanzees.pdf|last=Tresz|first=Hilda|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall also observed the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt; sometimes going as far as [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; She says of this revelation, &quot;During the first ten years of the study I had believed […] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. […] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal&amp;mdash;that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimp&quot; /&gt; She described the 1974–78 [[Gombe Chimpanzee War]] in her memoir, ''Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe''. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Goodall also set herself apart from the traditional conventions of the time by naming the animals in her studies of primates instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time and was thought to be important in the removal of oneself from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become, to this day, the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society. She was the lowest-ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months. Among those whom Goodall named during her years in Gombe were:&lt;ref&gt;see [[Kasakela chimpanzee community]] for a more complete list and details.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Goodall established the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI), which supports the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe]] research, and she is a global leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. With nineteen offices around the world, the JGI is widely recognised for community-centred [[conservation movement|conservation and development]] programs in Africa. Its global youth program, [[Jane Goodall Institute (Hong Kong)#Roots &amp; Shoots|Roots &amp; Shoots]], began in 1991 when a group of 16 local teenagers met with Goodall on her back porch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They were eager to discuss a range of problems they knew about from first-hand experience that caused them deep concern. The organisation now has over 10,000 groups in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsandshoots.org/aboutus/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720235233/http://www.rootsandshoots.org/aboutus/history |archivedate=20 July 2011 |title=Our History |work=Roots &amp; Shoots |publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Goodall founded the [[Tchimpounga Sanctuary|Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilatation Center]] in the [[Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]] to care for chimpanzees orphaned due to bush-meat trade. The rehabilitation houses over a hundred chimps over its three islands.&lt;ref&gt;Westoll, Andrew. &quot;In an African sanctuary, help and hope for orphaned chimps&quot; ''The Globe And Mail'' https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/in-an-african-sanctuary-help-and-hope-for-orphaned-chimps/article4200620/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Goodall founded the Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education (TACARE or &quot;Take Care&quot;) pilot project to protect chimpanzees' habitat from deforestation by reforesting hills around [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe]] while simultaneously educating neighbouring communities on sustainability and agriculture training. The TACARE project also supports young girls by offering them access to reproductive health education and through scholarships to finance their college tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpsworld.com/esri-jane-goodall-institute-partner-to-protect-ecosystems/|title=Esri, Jane Goodall Institute partner to protect ecosystems|last=Barwacz|first=Allison|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to an overflow of handwritten notes, photographs, and data piling up at Jane's home in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1990s, the Jane Goodall Institute's Center for Primate Studies was created at the [[University of Minnesota]] to house and organise this data. Currently all of the original Jane Goodall archives reside there and have been digitised, analysed, and placed in an [[online database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees-gsrc|title=JGICPS|publisher=The Jane Goodall Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210215503/http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzees-gsrc|archive-date=10 February 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2011, [[Duke University]] spokesman Karl Bates announced that the archives will move to Duke, with [[Anne E. Pusey]], Duke's chairman of evolutionary anthropology, overseeing the collection. Pusey, who managed the archives in Minnesota and worked with Goodall in Tanzania, had worked at Duke for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2011/mar/18/wsmet03-goodall-papers-headed-to-duke-ar-872387/ |title=Goodall papers headed to Duke |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126232610/http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2011/mar/18/wsmet03-goodall-papers-headed-to-duke-ar-872387/ |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall is a vegetarian and advocates the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. In ''The Inner World of Farm Animals'', Goodall writes that farm animals are &quot;far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings in their own right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hatkoff, Amy. 2009. ''The Inner World of Farm Animals'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall has also said: &quot;Thousands of people who say they 'love' animals sit down once or twice a day to enjoy the flesh of creatures who have been treated so with little respect and kindness just to make more meat.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Goodall is an outspoken environmental advocate, speaking on the effects of climate change on endangered species such as chimpanzees. Goodall, alongside her foundation, collaborated with [[NASA]] to use satellite imagery from the Landsat series to remedy the effects of deforestation on chimpanzees and local communities in Western Africa by offering the villagers information on how to reduce activity and preserve their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/satellite-data-changed-chimpanzee-conservation-efforts|title=How Satellite Data Changed Chimpanzee Conservation Efforts|last=Hille|first=Karl|date=2017-01-24|website=NASA|access-date=2020-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, to ensure the safe and ethical treatment of animals during ethological studies, Goodall, alongside Professor [[Marc Bekoff|Mark Bekoff]], founded the organization Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Philip, and Jim Schaal, editors. “Jane Goodall.” ''Practicing Science, Living Faith: Interviews with Twelve Leading Scientists'', by William Phillips, Columbia University Press, New York, 2007, pp. 15–40. {{JSTOR|10.7312/clay13576.6}} Accessed 1 Apr. 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Goodall demanded the [[European Union]] end the use of medical research on animals and ensure more funding for alternative methods of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dr Jane Goodall appeals to EU to impose ban on animal testing&quot;. (2008, May 28). Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Goodall controversially described [[Edinburgh Zoo]]'s new primate enclosure as a &quot;wonderful facility&quot; where monkeys &quot;are probably better off [than those] living in the wild in an area like [[Budongo Forest|Budongo]], where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;Mike Wade, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article3972868.ece &quot;Zoos are best hope, says Jane Goodall&quot;.] ''The Times'', 20 May 2008.

In 2010, Goodall, through [[Jane Goodall Institute|JGI]], formed a coalition with a number of organizations such as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (WCS) and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) and petitioned to list all chimpanzees, including those that are captive, as [[Endangered species|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/petition-fws-endangered-chimpanzees.pdf|title=Petition|last=|first=|date=|website=Humane Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the U.S. [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]](FWS) announced that they would accept this rule and that all chimpanzees would be classified as endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/science/chimpanzees-endangered-fish-and-wildlife-service.html|title=U.S. Will Call All Chimps 'Endangered'|last=St. Fleur|first=Nicholas|date=June 12, 2015|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Goodall became a patron of Australian animal protection group [[Voiceless, the animal protection institute]]. &quot;I have for decades been concerned about factory farming, in part because of the tremendous harm inflicted on the environment, but also because of the shocking ongoing cruelty perpetuated on millions of sentient beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voiceless, the animal protection institute |url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/who-we-are/jane-goodall |access-date=4 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032918/https://www.voiceless.org.au/who-we-are/jane-goodall |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, she married [[Derek Bryceson]] (a member of [[Tanzania]]'s parliament and the director of that country's [[national park]]s); he died of cancer in October 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatApes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Walking With the Great Apes |last=Montgomery |first=Sy |year=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-395-51597-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/walkingwithgreat00mont/page/125 125–126] |url=https://archive.org/details/walkingwithgreat00mont/page/125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson was able to protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatApes&quot; /&gt;

Although Goodall has done animal research on chimpanzees exclusively for over 60 years, she has stated that dogs are her favourite animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/jane-goodall-my-favourite-animal-is-a-dog/article575777/|title=Jane Goodall: 'My favourite animal is a dog'|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|first=Zosia|last=Bielski|date=April 7, 2011|access-date=2020-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if she believes in God, Goodall said in September 2010: &quot;I don't have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall's Questions &amp; Answers, ''Readers Digest'', p. 128, September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall wrote in 1993: &quot;When, in the early 1960s, I brazenly used such words as 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'motivation', 'excitement', and 'mood' I was much criticised. Even worse was my crime of suggesting that chimpanzees had 'personalities'.

Many standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and [[social relation]]ships. This argument is the focus of a book published by Margaret Power in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;power&quot;&gt;Power, Margaret (1991). The Egalitarians – Human and Chimpanzee An Anthropological: View of Social Organization. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-40016-3}}.{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that higher levels of aggression and conflict with other chimpanzee groups in the area were due to the feeding, which could have created the &quot;wars&quot; between chimpanzee social groups described by Goodall, aspects of which she did not witness in the years before artificial feeding began at Gombe. Thus, some regard Goodall's observations as distortions of normal chimpanzee behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature03999 |pmid=16136128 |title=A century of getting to know the chimpanzee |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=56–59 |year=2005 |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans B.

[[Craig Stanford]] of the Jane Goodall Research Institute at the [[University of Southern California]] states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to inter-group conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stanford |first=Craig |title=The Egalitarians – Human and Chimpanzee |publisher=International Journal of Primatology |date=Winter 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

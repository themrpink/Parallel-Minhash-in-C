In a ceremony at the altar of [[Glasgow Cathedral]] on 10 December 1502, James confirmed the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1502)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] with [[Henry VII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Joseph, ed., ''Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland'', 1357–1509, vol. 4, HM Register House, Edinburgh (1888), nos. 1681, 1690–1697.&lt;/ref&gt; By this treaty James married Henry's daughter [[Margaret Tudor]]. After a wedding by proxy in London, the marriage was confirmed in person on 8 August 1503 at [[Holyrood Abbey]], [[Edinburgh]]. Their wedding was commemorated by the gift of a [[Hours of James IV of Scotland|Book of Hours]].

The union produced only one son who reached adulthood, with three further sons who died as infants and two stillborn daughters:{{cn|date=September 2020}}
*James Stewart, Duke of Rothesay (21 February 1507, [[Holyrood Palace]] – 27 February 1508, Stirling Castle), firstborn son, died an infant;
*A stillborn daughter, born at Holyrood Palace on 15 July 1508.
*Arthur Stewart, Duke of Rothesay (20 October 1509, Holyrood Palace – Edinburgh Castle, 14 July 1510), 2nd son, died an infant;
*King [[James V of Scotland|James V]] (Linlithgow Palace, 10 April 1512 – Falkland Palace, Fife, 14 December 1542), third and only child to survive infancy, successor to his father.
*A second stillborn daughter born at Holyrood Palace in November 1512.
*[[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Ross]] (Stirling Castle, 30 April 1514 – Stirling Castle, 18 December 1515), 4th son, born after James's death, died an infant.

{{plankton sidebar|Main groups}}

'''Phytoplankton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|aɪ|t|oʊ|ˈ|p|l|æ|ŋ|k|t|ə|n}}) are the [[autotrophic]] (self-feeding) components of the [[plankton]] community and a key part of ocean and freshwater [[Aquatic ecosystem|ecosystem]]s. The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words φυτόν (''phyton''), meaning &quot;[[plant]]&quot;, and πλαγκτός (''planktos''), meaning &quot;wanderer&quot; or &quot;drifter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thurman| first = H. V.| year = 2007| title = Introductory Oceanography| publisher = Academic Internet Publishers| location =| isbn = 978-1-4288-3314-2}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phytoplankton obtain their energy through [[photosynthesis]], as do trees and other plants on land. This means phytoplankton must have light from the sun, so they live in the well-lit surface layers ([[euphotic zone]]) of oceans and lakes. In comparison with terrestrial plants,  phytoplankton are distributed over a larger surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have markedly faster turnover rates than trees (days versus decades). As a result, phytoplankton respond rapidly on a global scale to climate variations.

Phytoplankton form the base of marine and freshwater food webs and are key players in the global [[carbon cycle]]. They account for about half of global photosynthetic activity and about half of the oxygen production, despite amounting to only about 1% of the global plant biomass. Phytoplankton are very diverse, varying from photosynthesising bacteria to plant-like algae to armour-plated [[coccolithophore]]s. Important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s, [[cyanobacteria]] and [[dinoflagellate]]s, although many other groups are represented.

Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. However, when present in high enough numbers, some varieties may be noticeable as colored patches on the water surface due to the presence of [[chlorophyll]] within their cells and accessory pigments (such as [[phycobiliprotein]]s or [[xanthophyll]]s) in some species.

== Types ==
Phytoplankton are [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] microscopic biotic organisms that inhabit the upper sunlit layer of almost all oceans and bodies of fresh water on Earth. They are agents for [[Marine primary production|primary production]], the creation of [[organic compounds]] from [[carbon dioxide]] dissolved in the water, a process that sustains the aquatic [[food web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosal; Rogers; Wray|first=S.; M.; A.|title=The Effects of Turbulence on Phytoplankton|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040171754&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchany%26Ntk%3DTitle%26Ns%3DLoaded-Date|work=Aerospace Technology Enterprise|publisher=NTRS|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoplankton form the base of the [[marine food web]] and are crucial players in the Earth's [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=NASA2015 /&gt;

Phytoplankton live in the [[photic zone]] of the ocean, where [[photosynthesis]] is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to [[photodegradation]]. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of [[marine food web]]s, they serve as prey for [[zooplankton]], [[fish larvae]] and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by [[viral lysis]]. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as [[dinoflagellate]]s, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and [[detritus]].&lt;ref name=Käse2018 /&gt;

Phytoplankton are crucially dependent on [[minerals]]. These are primarily [[macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]] such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] or [[silicic acid]], whose availability is governed by the balance between the so-called [[biological pump]] and [[upwelling]] of deep, nutrient-rich waters. Phytoplankton nutrient composition drives and is driven by the [[Redfield ratio]] of macronutrients generally available throughout the surface oceans. However, across large areas of the oceans such as the [[Southern Ocean]], phytoplankton are limited by the lack of the [[micronutrient]] [[iron]]. This has led to some scientists advocating [[iron fertilization]] as a means to counteract the accumulation of [[Human impact on the environment|human-produced]] carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=richtel07&gt;{{Cite news | first = M. | last = Richtel | title = Recruiting Plankton to Fight Global Warming | newspaper = New York Times  | date = 1 May 2007 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/business/01plankton.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale experiments have added iron (usually as salts such as [[iron sulphate]]) to the oceans to promote phytoplankton growth and draw [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] into the ocean. Controversy about manipulating the ecosystem and the efficiency of iron fertilization has slowed such experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monastersky |first1=Richard |title=Iron versus the Greenhouse: Oceanographers Cautiously Explore a Global Warming Therapy |journal=Science News |volume=148 |issue=14 |year=1995 |pages=220–1 |doi=10.2307/4018225|jstor=4018225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoplankton depend on [[B Vitamins]] for survival. Areas in the ocean have been identified as having a major lack of some B Vitamins, and correspondingly, phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120723162613.htm |title=Existence of vitamin 'deserts' in the ocean confirmed|work=ScienceDaily|first=Sergio|last=Sañudo-Wilhelmy|date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of [[anthropogenic warming]] on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research. Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important effects on future phytoplankton productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=S.

The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community structure has also received considerable attention. Phytoplankton such as coccolithophores contain calcium carbonate cell walls that are sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence suggests some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid time-scales (months to years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Sinéad|last2=Rost|first2=Björn|last3=Rynearson|first3=Tatiana A.|date=2013-11-25|title=Evolutionary potential of marine phytoplankton under ocean acidification|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=140–155|doi=10.1111/eva.12120|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3894903|pmid=24454553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lohbeck|first1=Kai T.|last2=Riebesell|first2=Ulf|last3=Reusch|first3=Thorsten B.

Phytoplankton serve as the base of the aquatic food web, providing an essential ecological function for all aquatic life. Under future conditions of anthropogenic warming and ocean acidification, changes in phytoplankton mortality due to changes in rates of [[zooplankton]] grazing may be significant.&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli2019 /&gt; One of the many [[food chains]] in the ocean – remarkable due to the small number of links – is that of phytoplankton sustaining [[krill]] (a [[crustacean]] similar to a tiny shrimp), which in turn sustain [[baleen whales]].

The term phytoplankton encompasses all photoautotrophic microorganisms in aquatic [[food web]]s. However, unlike terrestrial [[communities]], where most autotrophs are [[plants]], phytoplankton are a diverse group, incorporating [[protista]]n [[eukaryote]]s and both [[Bacteria|eubacterial]] and [[archaebacteria]]l [[prokaryote]]s. There are about 5,000 known species of marine phytoplankton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallegraeff 03&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on Harmful Marine Microalgae|last=Hallegraeff|first=G.M.|publisher=Unesco|year=2003|isbn=978-92-3-103871-6|editor-last1=Hallegraeff|editor-first1=Gustaaf M.|pages=25–49|chapter=Harmful algal blooms: a global overview|editor-last2=Anderson|editor-first2=Donald Mark|editor-last3=Cembella|editor-first3=Allan D.|editor-last4=Enevoldsen|editor-first4=Henrik O.|chapter-url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001317/131711e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; How such diversity [[evolution|evolved]] despite scarce resources (restricting [[niche differentiation]]) is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchinson|first1=G.

In terms of numbers, the most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s, [[cyanobacteria]] and [[dinoflagellate]]s, although many other groups of [[algae]] are represented. One group, the [[coccolithophore|coccolithophorids]], is responsible (in part) for the release of significant amounts of [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. DMS is [[Redox|oxidized]] to form sulfate which, in areas where ambient [[aerosol]] particle concentrations are low, can contribute to the population of [[cloud condensation nuclei]], mostly leading to increased cloud cover and cloud [[albedo]] according to the so-called [[CLAW hypothesis|CLAW Hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceanicphytoplankton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlson|first1=Robert J.|last2=Lovelock|first2=James E.|last3=Andreae|first3=Meinrat O.|last4=Warren|first4=Stephen G.|year=1987|title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate|journal=Nature|volume=326|issue=6114|pages=655–61|bibcode=1987Natur.326..655C|doi=10.1038/326655a0|s2cid=4321239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=P.

In [[oligotroph]]ic oceanic regions such as the [[Sargasso Sea]] or the [[South Pacific Gyre]], phytoplankton is dominated by the small sized cells, called [[Photosynthetic picoplankton|picoplankton]] and nanoplankton (also referred to as picoflagellates and nanoflagellates), mostly composed of [[cyanobacteria]] (''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', ''[[Synechococcus]]'') and picoeucaryotes such as ''[[Micromonas]]''.  Within more productive ecosystems, dominated by [[upwelling]] or high terrestrial inputs, larger [[dinoflagellate]]s are the more dominant phytoplankton and reflect a larger portion of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calbet|first1=A.|year=2008|title=The trophic roles of microzooplankton in marine systems|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=65|issue=3|pages=325–31|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fsn013|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth strategies ==
In the early twentieth century, [[Alfred C. Redfield]] found the similarity of the phytoplankton's elemental composition to the major dissolved nutrients in the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Redfield |first1=Alfred C. |year=1934 |chapter=On the Proportions of Organic Derivatives in Sea Water and their Relation to the Composition of Plankton |pages=176–92 |editor1-last=Johnstone |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Daniel |editor2-first=Richard Jellicoe |title=James Johnstone Memorial Volume |location=Liverpool |publisher=University Press of Liverpool |oclc=13993674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redfield proposed that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen to phosphorus (106:16:1) in the ocean was controlled by the phytoplankton's requirements, as phytoplankton subsequently release nitrogen and phosphorus as they are remineralized. This so-called “[[Redfield ratio]]” in describing [[stoichiometry]] of phytoplankton and seawater has become a fundamental principle to understand marine ecology, biogeochemistry and phytoplankton evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrigo K.R 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arrigo |first1=Kevin R. |title=Marine microorganisms and global nutrient cycles |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7057 |pages=349–55 |year=2005 |pmid=16163345 |doi=10.1038/nature04159 |bibcode=2005Natur.437..349A |s2cid=62781480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Redfield ratio is not a universal value and it may diverge due to the changes in exogenous nutrient delivery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanning |first1=Kent A. |title=Influence of atmospheric pollution on nutrient limitation in the ocean |journal=Nature |volume=339 |issue=6224 |year=1989 |pages=460–63 |bibcode=1989Natur.339..460F |doi=10.1038/339460a0 |s2cid=4247689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and microbial metabolisms in the ocean, such as [[nitrogen fixation]], [[denitrification]] and [[anammox]].

The dynamic stoichiometry shown in unicellular algae reflects their capability to store nutrients in an internal pool, shift between enzymes with various nutrient requirements and alter osmolyte composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert Warner |last1=Sterner |first2=James J. |last2=Elser |year=2002 |title=Ecological Stoichiometry: The Biology of Elements from Molecules to the Biosphere |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-07491-7 }}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klausmeier |first1=Christopher A. |last2=Litchman |first2=Elena |last3=Levin |first3=Simon A. |title=Phytoplankton growth and stoichiometry under multiple nutrient limitation |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=49 |issue=4 Part 2 |year=2004 |pages=1463–70 |doi=10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1463 |bibcode=2004LimOc..49.1463K |s2cid=16438669 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2bae015161ae88edde1dbbe919da66da092ec6e6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cellular components have their own unique stoichiometry characteristics,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrigo K.R 2005&quot;/&gt; for instance, resource (light or nutrients) acquisition machinery such as proteins and chlorophyll contain a high concentration of nitrogen but low in phosphorus. Meanwhile, growth machinery such as ribosomal RNA contains high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations.

Based on allocation of resources, phytoplankton is classified into three different growth strategies, namely survivalist, bloomer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klausmeier |first1=Christopher A. |last2=Litchman |first2=Elena |last3=Daufresne |first3=Tanguy |last4=Levin |first4=Simon A. |title=Optimal nitrogen-to-phosphorus stoichiometry of phytoplankton |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6988 |pages=171–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15141209 |bibcode=2004Natur.429..171K |doi=10.1038/nature02454 |s2cid=4308845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalist. Survivalist phytoplankton has a high ratio of N:P (&gt;30) and contains an abundance of resource-acquisition machinery to sustain growth under scarce resources. Bloomer phytoplankton has a low N:P ratio (&lt;10), contains a high proportion of growth machinery, and is adapted to exponential growth. Generalist phytoplankton has similar N:P to the Redfield ratio and contain relatively equal resource-acquisition and growth machinery.

==Factors affecting abundance==
The [[NAAMES study]] was a five-year scientific research program conducted between 2015 and 2019 by scientists from [[Oregon State University]] and [[NASA]] to investigated aspects of phytoplankton dynamics in ocean ecosystems, and how such dynamics influence [[Atmospheric Aerosol Particles|atmospheric aerosols]], clouds, and climate (NAAMES stands for the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study). The study focused on the sub-arctic region of the North Atlantic Ocean, which is the site of one of Earth's largest recurring phytoplankton blooms. The long history of research in this location, as well as relative ease of accessibility, made the North Atlantic an ideal location to test prevailing scientific hypotheses&lt;ref name=Behrenfeld2018&gt;Behrenfeld, M.J. and Boss, E.S.

In the diagram on the right, the compartments influenced by phytoplankton include the atmospheric gas composition, inorganic nutrients, and trace element fluxes as well as the transfer and cycling of organic matter via biological processes. The photosynthetically fixed carbon is rapidly recycled and reused in the surface ocean, while a certain fraction of this biomass is exported as sinking particles to the deep ocean, where it is subject to ongoing transformation processes, e.g., remineralization.&lt;ref name=Heinrichs2020&gt;{{cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_15|chapter = Complex Interactions Between Aquatic Organisms and Their Chemical Environment Elucidated from Different Perspectives|title = YOUMARES 9 - the Oceans: Our Research, Our Future|year = 2020|last1 = Heinrichs|first1 = Mara E.|last2 = Mori|first2 = Corinna|last3 = Dlugosch|first3 = Leon|pages = 279–297|isbn = 978-3-030-20388-7}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

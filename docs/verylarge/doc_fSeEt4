Fairy tales have been enacted dramatically; records exist of this in [[commedia dell'arte]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;Commedia Dell'Arte&quot;, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;Commedia Dell'Arte&quot;, p. 745.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[film|cinema]] has meant that such stories could be presented in a more plausible manner, with the use of [[special effects]] and [[animation]]. [[The Walt Disney Company]] has had a significant impact on the evolution of the fairy tale film. Some of the earliest short silent films from the Disney studio were based on fairy tales, and some fairy tales were adapted into shorts in the musical comedy series &quot;[[Silly Symphony]]&quot;, such as ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]''. [[Walt Disney]]'s first feature-length film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', released in 1937, was a ground-breaking film for fairy tales and, indeed, fantasy in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant&quot;/&gt; Disney and his creative successors have returned to traditional and literary fairy tales numerous times with films such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). Disney's influence helped establish the fairy tale genre as a genre for children, and has been accused by some of [[bowdlerizing]] the gritty naturalism&amp;nbsp;– and sometimes unhappy endings&amp;nbsp;– of many folk fairy tales.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky /&gt; However, others note that the softening of fairy tales occurred long before Disney, some of which was even done by the Grimm brothers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stone |first1=Kay |title=Marchen to Fairy Tale: An Unmagical Transformation |journal=Western Folklore |date=July 1981 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=232–244 |doi=10.2307/1499694 |jstor=1499694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, M.|year=1987|title=The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/hardfactsofgri00tata/page/24 24]|isbn=978-0-691-06722-3|url=https://archive.org/details/hardfactsofgri00tata/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filmed fairy tales have been made primarily for children, from Disney's later works to Aleksandr Rou's retelling of ''[[Vasilissa the Beautiful]]'', the first [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film]] to use Russian folk tales in a big-budget feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = James Graham | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html | archivedate = 2013-01-09 | title = Baba Yaga in Film | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used the conventions of fairy tales to create new stories with sentiments more relevant to contemporary life, as in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scheib, [http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/labyrinth-1986.htm Review of ''Labyrinth'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', and the films of [[Michel Ocelot]].&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works have retold familiar fairy tales in a darker, more horrific or psychological variant aimed primarily at adults. Notable examples are [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115234313/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forbewty.html | archivedate = 2013-11-15 | title = Beauty and the Beast | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', based on [[Angela Carter]]'s retelling of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130920005533/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrPathNeedles.html | archivedate = 2013-09-20 | title = The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-07-14|date=2006-12-25 |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707173614/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html| archivedate = July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Suspiria]]'', and ''[[Spike (2008 film)|Spike]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://variety.com/2008/film/news/festival-highlights-1117987482/ | title = Festival Highlights: 2008 Edinburgh International Film Festival | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-06-13 | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; create new stories in this genre from fairy tale and folklore motifs.

In comics and animated TV series, ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Princess Tutu]]'', ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' and ''[[MÄR]]'' all make use of standard fairy tale elements to various extents but are more accurately categorised as [[fairytale fantasy]] due to the definite locations and characters which a longer narrative requires.

A more modern cinematic fairy tale would be [[Luchino Visconti|Luchino Visconti's]] ''[[Le Notti Bianche]]'', starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before he became a superstar. It involves many of the romantic conventions of fairy tales, yet it takes place in post-[[World War II]] [[Italy]], and it ends realistically.

==Motifs==

[[File:Warwick Goble Beauty and Beast.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The princess is standing alongside the &quot;beast&quot;, who is lying on the ground.|[[Beauty and the Beast]], illustration by [[Warwick Goble]]]]

Any comparison of fairy tales quickly discovers that many fairy tales have features in common with each other. Two of the most influential classifications are those of [[Antti Aarne]], as revised by [[Stith Thompson]] into the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]], and [[Vladimir Propp]]'s ''[[Morphology of the Folk Tale]]''.

===Aarne-Thompson===

This system groups fairy and folk tales according to their overall plot. Common, identifying features are picked out to decide which tales are grouped together. Much therefore depends on what features are regarded as decisive.

For instance, tales like ''[[Cinderella]]''&amp;nbsp;– in which a persecuted heroine, with the help of the [[fairy godmother]] or similar [[donor (fairy tale)|magical helper]], attends an event (or three) in which she wins the love of a prince and is identified as his true bride{{nsmdns}}are classified as type 510, the persecuted heroine. Some such tales are ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; ''[[Aschenputtel]]''; ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]''; ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]''; ''[[Ye Xian]]''; ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''; ''[[Catskin]]''; ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]''; ''[[Finette Cendron]]''; ''[[Allerleirauh]]''.

Further analysis of the tales shows that in ''Cinderella'', ''The Wonderful Birch'', ''The Story of Tam and Cam'', ''Ye Xian'', and ''Aschenputtel'', the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission to go to the ball or other event, and in ''Fair, Brown and Trembling'' and ''Finette Cendron'' by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in ''Cap O' Rushes'', ''Catskin'', and ''Allerleirauh'', the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in ''Katie Woodencloak'', she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in ''Tattercoats'', she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, ''Katie Woodencloak'' is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and ''Tattercoats'' as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.

This system has its weaknesses in the difficulty of having no way to classify subportions of a tale as motifs. ''[[Rapunzel]]'' is type 310 (The Maiden in the Tower), but it opens with a child being demanded in return for stolen food, as does ''[[Puddocky]]''; but ''Puddocky'' is not a Maiden in the Tower tale, while ''[[The Canary Prince]]'', which opens with a jealous stepmother, is.

It also lends itself to emphasis on the common elements, to the extent that the folklorist describes ''[[The Black Bull of Norroway]]'' as the same story as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. This can be useful as a shorthand but can also erase the coloring and details of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===

[[File:1932. Билибин. Морозко.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Father Frost, a fairy tale character made of ice, acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale &quot;Father Frost&quot;. He tests the heroine, a veiled young girl sitting in the snow, before bestowing riches upon her.|Father Frost acts as a donor in the Russian fairy tale ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', testing the heroine before bestowing riches upon her]]

[[Vladimir Propp]] specifically studied a collection of [[Russian fairy tale]]s, but his analysis has been found useful for the tales of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''.&lt;/ref&gt; Having criticized Aarne-Thompson type analysis for ignoring what motifs ''did'' in stories, and because the motifs used were not clearly distinct,&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; he analyzed the tales for the ''function'' each character and action fulfilled and concluded that a tale was composed of thirty-one elements ('functions') and seven characters or 'spheres of action' ('the princess and her father' are a single sphere). While the elements were not all required for all tales, when they appeared they did so in an invariant order&amp;nbsp;– except that each individual element might be negated twice, so that it would appear [[rule of three (writing)|three times]], as when, in ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', the brother resists drinking from enchanted streams twice, so that it is the third that enchants him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Propp's 31 functions also fall within six 'stages' (preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition), and a stage can also be repeated, which can affect the perceived order of elements.

One such element is the ''[[donor (fairy tale)|donor]]'' who gives the hero magical assistance, often after testing him.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking [[fox]] tests the hero by warning him against entering an inn and, after he succeeds, helps him find the object of his quest; in ''[[The Boy Who Drew Cats]]'', the priest advised the hero to stay in small places at night, which protects him from an evil spirit; in ''[[Cinderella]]'', the fairy godmother gives Cinderella the dresses she needs to attend the ball, as their mothers' spirits do in ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''; in ''[[The Fox Sister]]'', a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk gives the brothers magical bottles to protect against the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. The roles can be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Red Ettin]]'', the role is split into the mother{{nsmdns}}who offers the hero the whole of a journey cake with her curse or half with her blessing{{nsmdns}}and when he takes the half, a fairy who gives him advice; in ''[[Mr Simigdáli]]'', the sun, the moon, and the stars all give the heroine a magical gift. Characters who are not always the donor can act like the donor.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kallo and the Goblins]]'', the villain goblins also give the heroine gifts, because they are tricked; in ''[[Schippeitaro]]'', the evil [[cat]]s betray their secret to the hero, giving him the means to defeat them. Other fairy tales, such as ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'', do not feature the donor.

Analogies have been drawn between this and the analysis of myths into the [[Monomyth|hero's journey]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Vogler, ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers'', 2nd edition, p. 30, {{ISBN|0-941188-70-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==

Many fairy tales have been interpreted for their (purported) significance. One mythological interpretation saw many fairy tales, including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]]'', as [[solar deity|solar myths]]; this mode of interpretation subsequently became rather less popular.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychoanalysis|Freudian]], [[analytical psychology|Jungian]], and other [[psychology|psychological]] analyses have also explicated many tales, but no mode of interpretation has established itself definitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Bettleheim Bruno|title= The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|publisher= Penguin|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0-14-013727-9|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/usesofenchantmen0000bett_n7b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific analyses have often been criticized{{by whom|date=May 2016}} for lending great importance to motifs that are not, in fact, integral to the tale; this has often stemmed from treating one instance of a fairy tale as the definitive text, where the tale has been told and retold in many variations.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, &quot;Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically&quot;, pp. 18–19, James M. McGlathery, ed., ''The Brothers Grimm and Folktale'', {{ISBN|0-252-01549-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants of ''[[Bluebeard]]'', the wife's curiosity is betrayed by [[Bluebeard|a blood-stained key]], by [[Fitcher's Bird|an egg's breaking]], or by [[How the Devil Married Three Sisters|the singing of a rose she wore]], without affecting the tale, but interpretations of specific variants have claimed that the precise object is integral to the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other folklorists have interpreted tales as historical documents. Many{{quantify|date=May 2016}} German folklorists, believing the tales to have preserved details from ancient times, have used the Grimms' tales to explain ancient customs.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach sees the topography of European Märchen as echoing the period immediately following the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other folklorists have explained the figure of the wicked stepmother in a historical/sociological context: many women did die in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p. 213. {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 lecture, [[Jack Zipes]] reads fairy tales as examples of what he calls &quot;childism&quot;. He suggests that there are terrible aspects to the tales, which (among other things) have conditioned children to accept mistreatment and even abuse.&lt;ref&gt;
Jack Zipes, [https://archive.is/20121212173344/http://ias.umn.edu/2012/11/15/zipes-jack/ &quot;Fairy Tales, Child Abuse, and 'Childism'&quot;], (lecture, University of Minnesota Institute for Advanced Study, November 15, 2012).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fairy tales in music ==
Fairy tales have inspired music, namely opera, such as the French [[Opéra féerie]] and the German [[Märchenoper]]. French examples include Gretry's ''[[Zémire et Azor]]'', and Auber's ''[[Le cheval de bronze]]'', German operas are Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', Siegfried Wagner's ''[[An allem ist Hütchen schuld!]]'', which is based on many fairy tales, and Carl Orff's ''[[Die Kluge]]''. Even contemporary fairy tales have been written for the purpose of inspiration in the music world. &quot;Raven Girl&quot; by [[Audrey Niffenegger]] was written to inspire a new dance for the Royal Ballet in London.

The song &quot;Singring and the Glass Guitar&quot; by the American band Utopia, recorded for their album &quot;Ra&quot;, is called &quot;An Electrified Fairytale&quot;. Composed by the four members of the band, Roger Powell, Kasim Sulton, Willie Wilcox and Todd Rundgren, it tells the story of the theft of the Glass Guitar by Evil Forces, which has to be recovered by the four heroes.

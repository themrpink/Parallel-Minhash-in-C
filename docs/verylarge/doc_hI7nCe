Strepsiptera eggs hatch inside the female, and the [[planidium|planidium larvae]] can move around freely within the female's [[haemocoel]]; this behavior is unique to these insects. The larvae escape through the female's brood canal, which communicates with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The larvae are very active, because they only have a limited amount of time to find a host before they exhaust their food reserves. These first-[[instar]] larvae have [[stemmata]] (simple, single-lens eyes). When the larvae latch onto a host, they enter it by secreting enzymes that soften the cuticle, usually in the abdominal region of the host. Some species have been reported to enter the eggs of hosts.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Larvae of ''Stichotrema dallatorreanurn'' Hofeneder from [[Papua New Guinea]] were found to enter their [[orthoptera]]n host's tarsus (foot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kathirithamby | first1 = Jeyaraney | year = 2001 | title = Stand tall and they still get you in your Achilles foot-pad | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 268 | issue = 1483| pages = 2287–2289 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1810| pmc = 1088878 | pmid=11703867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once inside the host, they undergo [[hypermetamorphosis]] and become a less-mobile, legless larval form. They induce the host to produce a bag-like structure inside which they feed and grow. This structure, made from host tissue, protects them from the immune defences of the host. Larvae go through four more 
instars, and in each moult  the older cuticle separates but is not discarded (&quot;[[apolysis]] without [[ecdysis]]&quot;), so multiple layers form around the larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kathirithamby | first1 = Jeyaraney | last2 = Ross | first2 = Larry D. | last3 = Johnston | first3 = J.

Male larvae pupate after the last moult, but females directly become neotenous adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beani, Laura |year=2006|title= Crazy wasps: when parasites manipulate the ''Polistes'' phenotype| journal= Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=43| pages=564–574 |url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anz43-free/anz43-564.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal|author = Kathirithamby, J |year=2000| title= Morphology of the female Myrmecolacidae (Strepsiptera) including the ''apron'', and an associated structure analogous to the peritrophic matrix| journal= Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume= 128| pages=269–287| doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2000.tb00164.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour and shape of the host's abdomen may be changed and the host usually becomes sterile. The parasites then undergo [[pupation]] to become adults. Adult males emerge from the host bodies, while females stay inside. Females may occupy up to 90% of the abdominal volume of their hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt;

Adult male Strepsiptera have eyes unlike those of any other [[insect]], resembling the schizochroal eyes found in the [[trilobite]] group known as the [[Phacopina]]. Instead of a [[compound eye]] consisting of hundreds to thousands of [[ommatidia]], that each produce a [[pixel]] of the entire image - the strepsipteran eyes consist of only a few dozen &quot;eyelets&quot;  that each produce a complete image. These eyelets are separated by cuticle and/or setae, giving the cluster eye as a whole a blackberry-like appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1= Buschbeck, E.

Very rarely, multiple females may live within a single stylopized host; multiple males within a single host are somewhat more common. Adult males are rarely observed, however, although specimens may be lured using cages containing virgin females. Nocturnal specimens can also be collected at light traps.&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt;

Strepsiptera of the family Myrmecolacidae can cause their ant hosts to linger on the tips of grass leaves, increasing the chance of being found by the parasite's males (in case of females) and putting them in a good position for male emergence (in case of males).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3494966| issn = 0015-4040| volume = 72| issue = 1| pages = 43–51| last = Wojcik| first = Daniel P.| title = Behavioral Interactions between Ants and Their Parasites| journal = The Florida Entomologist| date = 1989| jstor = 3494966| url = https://naldc-legacy.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=23159&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strepsiptera were once believed to be the sister group to the beetle families [[Meloidae]] and [[Ripiphoridae]], which have similar parasitic development and forewing reduction; early molecular research suggested their inclusion as a sister group to the [[flies]],&lt;ref name=insencyc/&gt; in a clade called the halteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whiting | first1 = Michael F. | year = 1998 | title = Long-Branch Distraction and the Strepsiptera | url = http://whitinglab.byu.edu/PDF/longbranchstrep.pdf | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 134–138 | doi = 10.1080/106351598261076 | pmid = 12064233 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901165715/http://whitinglab.byu.edu/PDF/longbranchstrep.pdf | archive-date = 2006-09-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have one pair of the wings modified into halteres,&lt;ref name=strepprob&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whiting | first1 = Michael F. | last2 = Carpenter | first2 = James C. | last3 = Wheeler | first3 = Quentin D. | last4 = Wheeler | first4 = Ward C. | year = 1997 | title = The Stresiptera Problem: Phylogeny of the Holometabolous Insect Orders Inferred from 18S and 28S Ribosomal DNA Sequences and Morphology | url = | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 1–68 | doi=10.2307/2413635| jstor = 2413635 | pmid = 11975347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and failed to support their relationship to the beetles.&lt;ref name=strepprob/&gt; Further molecular studies, however, suggested they are outside the clade Mecopterida (containing the Diptera and Lepidoptera), but found no strong evidence for affinity with any other extant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonneton | first1 = F. | last2 = Brunet | first2 = F.

===Families===
The Strepsiptera have two major groups: the Stylopidia and Mengenillidia. The Mengenillidia include three extinct families (Cretostylopidae, Protoxenidae, and Mengeidae) plus two extant families (Bahiaxenidae and Mengenillidae; the latter is not monophyletic, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bravoetal&quot; /&gt;) They are considered more primitive, and the known females (Mengenillidae only) are free-living, with rudimentary legs and antennae. The females have a single genital opening. The males have strong mandibles, a distinct labrum, and more than five antennal segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt;[[File:Andrena vaga m Stylops melittae fm3.JPG|thumb|''[[Andrena vaga]]'' male bee, with ''[[Stylops melittae]]'' mating on its abdomen]]

The other group, the Stylopidia, includes seven families: the Corioxenidae, Halictophagidae, Callipharixenidae, Bohartillidae, Elenchidae, Myrmecolacidae, and Stylopidae. All Stylopidia have endoparasitic females having multiple genital openings.&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt;

The Stylopidae have four-segmented tarsi and four- to six-segmented antennae, with the third segment having a lateral process. The family Stylopidae may be [[paraphyletic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insencyc&quot; /&gt; The Elenchidae have two-segmented tarsi and four-segmented antennae, with the third segment having a lateral process. The Halictophagidae have three-segmented tarsi and seven-segmented antennae, with lateral processes from the third and fourth segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;borror&quot; /&gt;
The Stylopidae mostly parasitize wasps and bees, the Elenchidae are known to parasitize Fulgoroidea, while the Halictophagidae are found on leafhoppers, treehoppers, and mole cricket hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;borror&quot; /&gt;

Strepsipteran insects in the genus [[Xenos (insect)|''Xenos'']] parasitize ''[[Polistes carnifex]]'', a species of social wasps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathirithamby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kathirithamby | first1 = Jeyaraney | last2 = Hughes | first2 = David | year = 2006 | title = Description and biological notes of the first species of Xenos (Strepsiptera: Stylopidae) parasitic in Polistes carnifex F.

==Uses==
Some insects which have been considered as [[pest (organism)|pests]] may have strepsipteran endoparasites. [[biological control|Inoculation of a pest population with the corresponding parasitoid]] may sometimes aid in reducing the impact of such pests, although no strepsipterans have ever been tested for use in this capacity, let alone being available for such purposes, either commercially or experimentally. In India the species ''[[Halictophagus palmae]]'' was first described as a new species in 2000, and in the original description the authors mused about the possible future uses of their discovery. A 2011 book later mentioned these musings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Venkateswarlu|first1=B.|last2=Shanker|first2=Arun|last3=Shanker|first3=Chitra|last4=Maheswari|first4=M.|title=Crop Stress and its Management: Perspectives and Strategies|date=Nov 22, 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-9400722194|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surgery'''{{efn|From the {{lang-el|χειρουργική}} ''cheirourgikē'' (composed of χείρ, &quot;hand&quot;, and ἔργον, &quot;work&quot;), via {{lang-la|chirurgiae}}, meaning &quot;hand work&quot;.}} is a medical or dental specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a person to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas.

The act of performing surgery may be called a '''surgical procedure''', '''operation''', or simply &quot;surgery&quot;. In this context, the verb &quot;operate&quot; means to perform surgery. The adjective '''surgical''' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. [[surgical instrument]]s or [[surgical nurse]]. The person or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A [[surgeon]] is a person who practices surgery and a [[surgeon's assistant]] is a person who practices surgical assistance. A [[surgical team]] is made up of surgeon, [[surgeon's assistant]], anaesthetist, circulating nurse and [[surgical technologist]]. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term &quot;surgery&quot; can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a [[Doctor's office|physician]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|title=Doctor's surgery|dictionary=Collins English Dictionary|access-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210062151/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doctors-surgery|archive-date=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dentist]], or [[veterinarian]].

== Definitions ==
Surgery is an invasive technique with the fundamental principle of physical intervention on organs/organ systems/tissues for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.

As a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a person's tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound.  Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as [[angioplasty]] or [[endoscopy]], may be considered surgery if they involve &quot;common&quot; surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] conditions, typical [[surgical instruments]], and [[suturing]] or [[Surgical staple|stapling]].  All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called &quot;noninvasive surgery&quot; usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).

=== Types of surgery ===
Surgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.
* Based on timing: [[Elective surgery]] is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the person's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. A [[semi-elective surgery]] is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. [[Emergency surgery]] is surgery which must be done without any delay to prevent death or serious disabilties and/or loss of limbs and functions. 
* Based on purpose: [[Exploratory surgery]] is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition. [[Cosmetic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|Cosmetic surgery]] is done to subjectively improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure.
* By type of procedure: [[Amputation]] involves cutting off a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is also an example. '''Resection''' is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or code designation. A [[segmental resection]] can be of a smaller region of an organ such as a [[Lobes of liver|hepatic segment]] or a [[bronchopulmonary segment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NCI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms - National Cancer Institute |url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/segmental-resection |website=www.cancer.gov |access-date=31 July 2020 |language=en |date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Excision''' is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the person. '''Extirpation''' is the complete excision or surgical destruction of a body part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/extirpation|title=extirpation|website=[[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary|access-date=2020-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Replantation]] involves reattaching a severed body part. [[Reconstructive surgery]] involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. [[Organ transplant|Transplant]] surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the person undergoing surgery. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.
* By body part: When surgery is performed on one organ system or structure, it may be classed by the organ, organ system or tissue involved. Examples include cardiac surgery (performed on the heart), gastrointestinal surgery (performed within the digestive tract and its accessory organs), and orthopedic surgery (performed on bones or muscles).
* By degree of invasiveness of surgical procedures: [[Minimally-invasive procedures|Minimally-invasive surgery]] involves smaller outer incisions to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in [[laparoscopic surgery]] or [[angioplasty]]. By contrast, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] such as a [[laparotomy]] requires a large incision to access the area of interest.
* By equipment used: [[Laser surgery]] involves use of a [[laser]] for cutting tissue instead of a [[scalpel]] or similar surgical instruments. [[Microsurgery]] involves the use of an operating [[microscope]] for the surgeon to see small structures. [[Robotic surgery]] makes use of a surgical [[robot]], such as the [[Da Vinci Surgical System|Da Vinci]] or the [[ZEUS robotic surgical system]]s, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.

===Terminology===
{{main|List of surgical procedures}}
* Excision surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in '''-ectomy'''.
* Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in '''-otomy'''.  A surgical procedure cutting through the [[abdominal]] wall to gain access to the [[abdominal cavity]] is a [[laparotomy]].
* [[Minimally invasive surgery#Minimally invasive procedure|Minimally invasive procedures]], involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted, end in '''-oscopy'''.  For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called [[laparoscopy]].
* Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] in the body end in '''-ostomy'''.
* Reconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in '''-oplasty'''.  ''Rhino'' is used as a prefix for &quot;nose&quot;, therefore a ''[[rhinoplasty]]'' is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.
* Repair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in '''-rraphy'''.
* Reoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection.

== Description of surgical procedure ==
=== Location ===
[[Inpatient]] surgery is performed in a hospital, and the person undergoing surgery stays at least one night in the hospital after the surgery. [[Outpatient surgery]] occurs in a hospital outpatient department or freestanding ambulatory surgery center, and the person who had surgery is discharged the same working day.&lt;ref name=LemosIAAS2006&gt;{{cite book |name-list-style=vanc | editor1-last=Lemos |editor1-first=P |editor2-last=Jarrett |editor2-first=P |editor3-last=Philip |editor3-first=B| title = Day surgery: development and practice | publisher = International Association for Ambulatory Surgery | location = London | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-989-20-0234-7 |url=http://www.iaas-med.com/files/historical/DaySurgery.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office surgery occurs in a physician's office, and the person is discharged the same working day.&lt;ref name=Twersky2008&gt;{{cite book |name-list-style=vanc | editor1-last=Twersky |editor1-first=RS |editor2-last=Philip |editor2-first=BK| title = Handbook of ambulatory anesthesia|edition=2nd| publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-73328-9|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJT_yygipvYC&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[hospital]], modern surgery is often performed in an [[operating theater]] using [[surgical instrument]]s, an [[operating table]], and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Fingar KR, Stocks C, Weiss AJ, Steiner CA | title = Most Frequent Operating Room Procedures Performed in U.S. Hospitals, 2003–2012 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief No. 186 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = December 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb186-Operating-Room-Procedures-United-States-2012.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150503163129/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb186-Operating-Room-Procedures-United-States-2012.jsp | archive-date = 3 May 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of [[aseptic technique]]: the strict separation of &quot;sterile&quot; (free of microorganisms) things from &quot;unsterile&quot; or &quot;contaminated&quot; things.  All surgical instruments must be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]], and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if, it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire ([[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.

=== Preoperative care ===
{{main|Preoperative care}}
Prior to surgery, the person is given a [[medical examination]], receives certain pre-operative tests, and their [[physical fitness|physical status]] is rated according to the [[ASA physical status classification system]]. If these results are satisfactory, the person requiring surgery signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an [[autologous]] [[blood donation]] may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the [[digestive system]], the person requiring surgery may be instructed to perform a [[Whole bowel irrigation|bowel prep]] by drinking a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]] the night before the procedure. People preparing for surgery are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an [[Nil per os|NPO order]] after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the person vomits during or after the procedure.

Some medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACRfive&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |journal = Choosing Wisely: An Initiative of the ABIM Foundation |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-radiology/ |access-date = 17 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210080213/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-radiology/ |archive-date = 10 February 2013 }}, citing

''AORN journal'', ''66''(5), 819-838.&lt;/ref&gt; is so important in the surgical phase since here is where most of the family members can see who the staff of the surgery will be, also this area is where the nurses in charge to give information to the family members of the patient. In the pre-operative holding area, the person preparing for surgery changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral [[intravenous therapy|IV line]] is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000578.htm|title=The day of your surgery – adult: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the person enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an [[antiseptic]] (ideally [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] in alcoholic, as this is twice as effective as [[povidone-iodine]] for reduce the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wade |first1=Ryckie G. |last2=Burr |first2=Nicholas E. |last3=McCauley |first3=Gordon |last4=Bourke |first4=Grainne |last5=Efthimiou |first5=Orestis |title=The Comparative Efficacy of Chlorhexidine Gluconate and Povidone-iodine Antiseptics for the Prevention of Infection in Clean Surgery: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis |journal=Annals of Surgery |date=1 September 2020 |volume=Publish Ahead of Print |doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000004076|pmid=32773627 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The person is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific [[Surgical Positions|surgical position]], then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an &quot;ether screen&quot;, which separates the [[anesthetist]]/[[anesthesiologist]]'s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Shirley|title=Minor Surgical Procedures for Nurses and Allied Healthcare Professionals|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-470-01990-0|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaDbhAO3kS8C&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anesthesia]] is administered to prevent [[pain]] from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing.  Depending on the kind of operation, anesthesia may be provided [[local anesthesia|locally]] or as [[general anesthesia]].  [[Spinal anesthesia]] may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable.  With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the person can remain conscious or minimally sedated.  In contrast, general anesthesia renders the person unconscious and paralyzed during surgery.  The person is [[intubation|intubated]] and is placed on a [[mechanical ventilator]], and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.
Choice of surgical method and [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] technique aims to reduce the risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the [[surgical stress]] response.

===Intraoperative phase===
The intraoperative phase begins when the surgery subject is received in the surgical area (such as the [[operating theater]] or surgical [[Hospital#Departments or wards|department]]), and lasts until the subject is transferred to a recovery area (such as a [[post-anesthesia care unit]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.se/books?id=Qogt_LvTi-sC&amp;pg=PA2 Page 2] in: {{cite book | last=Spry | first=Cynthia | title=Essentials of perioperative nursing | publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers | location=Sudbury, Mass | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-7637-5881-3 | oclc=227920274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incision is made to access the surgical site.  [[Blood vessel]]s may be clamped or [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open.  The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum.  In certain cases, [[bone]] may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the [[human skull|skull]] for [[brain]] surgery or cutting the [[Human sternum|sternum]] for [[Thoracic surgery|thoracic (chest) surgery]] to open up the [[rib cage]]. Whilst in surgery [[Asepsis|aseptic technique]] is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the person's body that will be operated on. Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.

Work to correct the problem in body then proceeds.  This work may involve:

* [[Segmental resection|resection]] – partial removal of an organ or other bodily structure.
* reconnection of organs, tissues, etc., particularly if severed.  Resection of organs such as intestines involves reconnection.  Internal [[surgical suture|suturing]] or stapling may be used.  Surgical connection between blood vessels or other tubular or hollow structures such as loops of intestine is called [[anastomosis]].
* reduction – the movement or realignment of a body part to its normal position.  e.g. Reduction of a broken nose involves the physical manipulation of the bone or cartilage from their displaced state back to their original position to restore normal airflow and aesthetics.
* [[Ligature (medicine)|ligation]] – tying off blood vessels, ducts, or &quot;tubes&quot;.
* [[Medical grafting|grafts]] – may be severed pieces of tissue cut from the same (or different) body or flaps of tissue still partly connected to the body but resewn for rearranging or restructuring of the area of the body in question.  Although grafting is often used in cosmetic surgery, it is also used in other surgery.  Grafts may be taken from one area of the person's body and inserted to another area of the body.  An example is [[Vascular bypass|bypass surgery]], where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body.  Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.
* insertion of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] parts when needed.  Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used.  Sections of bone may be replaced with prosthetic rods or other parts.  Sometimes a plate is inserted to replace a damaged area of skull.  [[Artificial hip]] replacement has become more common.  [[Heart pacemaker]]s or [[Heart valve|valves]] may be inserted.  Many other types of [[Prosthesis|prostheses]] are used.
* creation of a [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]], a permanent or semi-permanent opening in the body
* in [[Organ transplant|transplant]] surgery, the donor organ (taken out of the donor's body) is inserted into the recipient's body and reconnected to the recipient in all necessary ways (blood vessels, ducts, etc.).
* [[arthrodesis]] – surgical connection of adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. [[Spinal fusion]] is an example of adjacent [[vertebrae]] connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.
* modifying the [[digestive tract]] in [[bariatric surgery]] for [[weight loss]].
* repair of a [[fistula]], [[hernia]], or [[prolapse]].
* repair according to the [[ICD-10-PCS]], in the Medical and Surgical Section 0, root operation Q, means restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function. This definition, repair, is used only when the method used to accomplish the repair is not one of the other root operations. Examples would be [[colostomy]] takedown, [[herniorrhaphy]] of a [[hernia]], and the [[surgical suture]] of a [[laceration]].
* other procedures, including:
:*clearing clogged ducts, blood or other vessels
:*removal of calculi (stones)
:*draining of accumulated fluids
:*[[debridement]] – removal of dead, damaged, or diseased tissue
[[Blood transfusion|Blood]] or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery.  Once the procedure is complete, [[surgical suture|sutures]] or [[Surgical staple|staples]] are used to close the incision.  Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped or reversed, and the person is taken off ventilation and [[wikt:extubate|extubated]] (if general anesthesia was administered).&lt;ref name=books.google.com&gt;Askitopoulou, H., Konsolaki, E., Ramoutsaki, I., Anastassaki, E.

===Postoperative care===
After completion of surgery, the person is transferred to the [[post anesthesia care unit]] and closely monitored.  When the person is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home.  During the post-operative period, the person's general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficiency and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity [[hypoventilation]] syndrome, [[atelectasis]] and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doyle S.L. |author2=Lysaght J. |author3=Reynolds J.V. | year = 2010 | title = Obesity and post-operative complications in patients undergoing non-bariatric surgery | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 12| pages = 875–86 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00700.x|pmid=20025695 |s2cid=7712323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.

It is not uncommon for surgical drains (see [[Drain (surgery)]]) to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery. Mostly these drains stay in until the volume tapers off, then they are removed.  These drains can become clogged, leading to [[abscess]].

Postoperative therapy may include [[adjuvant]] treatment such as [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], or administration of [[medication]] such as [[anti-rejection medication]] for transplants.

Through a retrospective analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This &quot;weekday effect&quot; has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aylin P, Alexandrescu R, Jen MH, Mayer EK, Bottle A |title=Day of week of procedure and 30-day mortality for elective surgery: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics |journal=BMJ |volume=346 |pages=f2424 |year=2013 |pmid=23716356 |pmc=3665889 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f2424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While pain is universal and expected after surgery, there is growing evidence that pain may be inadequately treated in many people in the acute period immediately after surgery.

==Epidemiology==
===United States===
In 2011, of the 38.6&amp;nbsp;million hospital stays in U.S. hospitals, 29% included at least one operating room procedure. These stays accounted for 48% of the total $387&amp;nbsp;billion in hospital costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Andrews RM | title = Characteristics of Operating Room Procedures in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief No. 170 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = February 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb170-Operating-Room-Procedures-United-States-2011.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328234122/http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb170-Operating-Room-Procedures-United-States-2011.jsp | archive-date = 28 March 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall number of procedures remained stable from 2001 to 2011. In 2011, over 15 million operating room procedures were performed in U.S. hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A | title = Trends in Operating Room Procedures in U.S. Hospitals, 2001–2011| work = HCUP Statistical Brief No. 171 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = March 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb171-Operating-Room-Procedure-Trends.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328235555/http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb171-Operating-Room-Procedure-Trends.jsp | archive-date = 28 March 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from 2003 to 2011 showed that U.S. hospital costs were highest for the surgical service line; the surgical service line costs were $17,600 in 2003 and projected to be $22,500 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Weiss AJ, Barrett ML, Steiner CA | title = Trends and Projections in Inpatient Hospital Costs and Utilization, 2003–2013 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief No. 175 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = July 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb175-Hospital-Cost-Utilization-Projections-2013.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140803212302/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb175-Hospital-Cost-Utilization-Projections-2013.jsp | archive-date = 3 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For hospital stays in 2012 in the United States, private insurance had the highest percentage of surgical expenditure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore B, Levit K and Elixhauser A&quot;&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Moore B, Levit K, Elixhauser A | title = Costs for Hospital Stays in the United States, 2012 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief No. 181 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = October 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb181-Hospital-Costs-United-States-2012.jsp | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129104404/https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb181-Hospital-Costs-United-States-2012.jsp | archive-date = 29 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, mean hospital costs in the United States were highest for surgical stays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore B, Levit K and Elixhauser A&quot;/&gt;

==Special populations==

===Elderly people===
Older adults have widely varying physical health.  [[Frailty syndrome|Frail elderly]] people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care.  Assessment of older people before elective surgery can accurately predict the person's recovery trajectories.&lt;ref name=Frailty&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makary MA, Segev DL, Pronovost PJ, etal |title=Frailty as a predictor of surgical in older patients|journal=J. Am. Coll. Surg.|volume=210|issue=6|pages=901–08|date=June 2010|pmid=20510798|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.01.028|lay-url=http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/who-thrives-after-surgery/?hpw|lay-date=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One frailty scale uses five items:  unintentional weight loss, [[muscle weakness]], exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed.  A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5.  Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes.&lt;ref name=Frailty /&gt; People who are frail and elderly (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.

===Children===
Surgery on children requires considerations that are not common in adult surgery. Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult for them to make informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. [[Bariatric Surgery#Bariatric Surgery in Youth|Bariatric surgery in youth]] is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.
{{See also|Pediatric surgery|Pediatric plastic surgery}}

===Vulnerable populations===
Doctors perform surgery with the consent of the person undergoing surgery. Some people are able to give better [[informed consent]] than others. Populations such as [[Incarceration|incarcerated persons]], [[dementia|people living with dementia]], the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as others, have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.

=='Global Surgery' in low- and middle-income countries==

Surgery remains grossly neglected in global health, famously described by [[Halfdan T. Mahler]] as the 'neglected stepchild of global health'. This particularly affects low-resource settings with weak surgical health systems. 'Global surgery' is the term now adopted to describe the rapidly developing field seeking to address this, and has been defined as 'the multidisciplinary enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the world's population, with its core tenets as the issues of need, access and quality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bath M, Bashford T, Fitzgerald JE |title=What is 'global surgery'?

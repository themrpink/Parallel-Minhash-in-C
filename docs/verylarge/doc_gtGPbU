{{Evidence law}}

In law, a '''witness''' is someone who has knowledge about a matter, whether they have sensed it or are testifying on another witnesses' behalf. In law a witness is someone who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, provides testimonial evidence, either oral or written, of what he or she knows or claims to know.

A [[Perception|percipient]] witness (or '''eyewitness''') is one with knowledge obtained through his or her own [[sense]]s (e.g., [[visual perception]], [[hearing]], [[Olfaction|smell]], touch).  That perception might be either with the unaided human sense or with the aid of an instrument, such as [[microscope]] or [[stethoscope]].

A ''[[hearsay]]'' witness is one who testifies about what someone else said or wrote.  In most court proceedings there are many limitations on when hearsay evidence is admissible.  Such limitations do not apply to grand jury investigations, many administrative proceedings, and may not apply to declarations used in support of an arrest or search warrant.  Also some types of statements are not deemed to be hearsay and are not subject to such limitations.

An ''[[expert witness]]'' is one who allegedly has specialized knowledge relevant to the matter of interest, which knowledge  purportedly helps to either make sense of other evidence,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=2014-11-07|title=Discovery|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/discovery|access-date=2020-10-22|website=www.justice.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; including other testimony, documentary evidence or physical evidence (e.g., a fingerprint).  An expert witness may or may not also be a percipient witness, as in a doctor or may or may not have treated the victim of an accident or crime.

A [[Character witness|''character witness'']] testifies about the personality of a defendant if it helps to solve the crime in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

A ''[[crown witness]]'' is one who incriminates former complices in a crime who following receive either a lower sentence, immunity or also a protection of themselves or/and their family by the court. After they have provided the court with their testimony they often enter into a witness protection program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2008|title=Good practices for the protection of witnesses in criminal proceedings involving organized crime|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/Witness-protection-manual-Feb08.pdf|access-date=21 October 2020|website=[[United Nations]]|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

In law a witness might be compelled to provide testimony in court, before a grand jury, before an administrative tribunal, before a deposition officer, or in a variety of other legal proceedings. A [[subpoena]] is a legal document that commands a person to appear at a proceeding. It is used to compel the [[testimony]] of a witness in a [[trial (law)|trial]]. Usually, it can be issued by a [[judge]] or by the [[lawyer]] representing the [[plaintiff]] or the [[defendant]] in a [[civil trial]] or by the [[prosecutor]] or the [[defense attorney]] in a [[Criminal procedure|criminal proceeding]], or by a [[government agency]]. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is compulsory to comply and with the subpoena and either take an [[oath]] or solemely [[Affirmation in law|affirm]] to testify truthfully under penalty of [[perjury]].

Although informally a witness includes whoever perceived the event, in law, a witness is different from an informant. A ''confidential informant'' is someone who claimed to have witnessed an event or have hearsay information, but whose identity is being withheld from at least one party (typically the criminal defendant).  The information from the confidential informant may have been used by a police officer or other official acting as a hearsay witness to obtain a search warrant.

=== Calling a witness ===
[[File:Heinrich Buscher.jpg|thumb|left|{{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich Buscher|de}} as a witness during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]]]

In a court proceeding, a witness may be ''called'' (requested to testify) by either the [[prosecution]] or the [[Defense (legal)|defense]]. The side that calls the witness first asks questions in what is called [[direct examination]]. The opposing side then may ask their own questions in what is called [[cross-examination]]. In some cases, [[redirect examination]] may be used by the side that called the witness but usually only to contradict specific testimony from the cross-examination.

'''Recalling a witness''' means calling a witness, who has already given testimony in a proceeding, to give further testimony. A court may give leave to a party to recall a witness only to give evidence about a matter [[wikt:adduce|adduced]] by another party if the second party's testimony contradicts evidence given by the original witness on direct examination.

===Testimony===
Witnesses are usually permitted to testify only what they experienced first-hand. In most cases, they may not testify about something they were told ([[hearsay]]). That restriction does not apply to expert witnesses, but they may testify only in the area of their expertise.

==Reliability==
Eyewitness testimony is generally presumed to be more reliable than [[circumstantial evidence]]. Studies have shown, however, that individual, separate witness testimony is often flawed, and parts of it can be meaningless. That can occur because of flaws in [[eyewitness identification]] (such as faulty observation and recollection, or bias) or because a witness is lying. If several people witness a crime, it is [[probative]] to look for similarities in their collective descriptions to substantiate the facts of an event but to keep in mind the contrasts between individual descriptions.

One study involved an experiment, in which subjects acted as [[juror]]s in a criminal case. Jurors heard a description of a robbery-murder, a prosecution argument, and then an argument for the defense. Some jurors heard only [[circumstantial evidence]]; others heard from a clerk who claimed to identify the defendant. In the former case, 18% percent found the defendant guilty, but in the latter case, 72% found the defendant guilty (Loftus 1988).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Police lineup]]s in which the eyewitness picks out a suspect from a group of people in the police station are often grossly suggestive, and they give the false impression that the witness remembered the suspect. In another study, students watched a staged crime. An hour later they looked through photos. A week later they were asked to pick the suspect out of lineups. 8% of the people in the lineups were mistakenly identified as criminals. 20% of the innocent people whose photographs were included were mistakenly identified (University of Nebraska 1977).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Weapon focus]] effects in which the presence of a weapon impairs [[memory]] for surrounding details is also an issue.

Another study looked at 65 cases of &quot;erroneous criminal convictions of innocent people.&quot; In 45% of the cases, eyewitness mistakes were responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;borchard&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/convictinginnoce00borcrich/convictinginnoce00borcrich_djvu.txt Convicting the Innocent: Sixty-Five Actual Errors of Criminal Justice] by Borchard, pg 367&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal study of eyewitness memory is usually undertaken within the broader category of [[cognition|cognitive processes]], the different ways in which we make sense of the world around us. That is done by employing the mental skills at one's disposal like thinking, perception, memory, awareness, reasoning, and judgment. Although cognitive processes can be only inferred and cannot be seen directly, they all have very important practical implications within a legal context.

If one were to accept that the way people think, perceive, reason, and judge is not always perfect, it becomes easier to understand why cognitive processes and the factors influencing the processes are studied by psychologists in matters of law, one being the grave implications that this imperfection can have within the criminal justice system.

The study of witness memory has dominated the realm of investigation. As Huff and Rattner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=160583|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; note, the single most important factor contributing to wrongful conviction is eyewitness misidentification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huff |first1=C. Ronald |last2=Rattner |first2=Arye |last3=Sagarin |first3=Edward |last4=MacNamara |first4=Donal E. J. |title=Guilty Until Proved Innocent: Wrongful Conviction and Public Policy |journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency |date=5 September 2016 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=518–544 |doi=10.1177/0011128786032004007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credibility==
{{Main|Credible witness}}
Several factors affect witnesses' [[credibility]]. Generally, they are deemed to be credible if they are recognized (or can be recognized) as a source of reliable information about someone, an event, or a phenomenon. As an example, the 2009 arrest of an [[illegal immigrant]] from [[El Salvador]] in the murder of federal intern [[Chandra Levy]] saw many questions arise surrounding the credibility of various witnesses.  Contesting the credibility of so-called &quot;expert&quot; witnesses rose into more common practice in the 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT18650918.2.23 |title=Law and Police |publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=A strong effort was made to impeach her credibility as a witness... it is competent to prove that the witness is an expert and not a mere pretender.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xWNFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4bsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4802,3268733 |title=Last Day of the Scandal Trial |publisher=Ithaca Democrat |date=8 July 1875 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=There was an irreconcilable difference of opinion as to the credibility of witnesses on each side.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones''''' is a 2002 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space-opera]] film directed by [[George Lucas]] and written by Lucas and [[Jonathan Hales]]. It is the second installment of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]], the fifth ''Star Wars'' film to be produced, and the second film in the &quot;[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker saga]].&quot; It stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], and [[Frank Oz]]. Set ten years after the events in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', the plot sees [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]] on the brink of civil war, with thousands of [[planetary system]]s threatening to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Galactic Republic]] and join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by the former [[Jedi]]-turned-[[Sith]] Lord [[Count Dooku]]. After Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] evades an assassination attempt, Jedi Apprentice [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] becomes her protector and develops a secret relationship with her, while his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] investigates the attempt on her life, leading him to uncover a [[Clone trooper|clone army]] in service of the Republic. Soon, the trio witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy: the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]].

Development of ''Attack of the Clones'' began in March 2000, some months after the release of ''The Phantom Menace''. By June 2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script, and principal photography took place from June to September 2000. The film crew primarily shot at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, with additional footage filmed in Tunisia, Spain, and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a [[digital cinematography|high-definition digital 24-frame system]].

The film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews, with some critics hailing it as an improvement over its predecessor ''The Phantom Menace'' and others considering it the worst installment of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thewrap.com/all-8-star-wars-movies-ranked-worst-best-new-hope-rogue-one/ |title=All 8 ‘Star Wars’ Movies Ranked, From ‘New Hope’ to ‘Rogue One’ |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=December 13, 2016|access-date=July 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720175352/https://www.thewrap.com/all-8-star-wars-movies-ranked-worst-best-new-hope-rogue-one/|archive-date=July 20, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gamesradar.com/every-star-wars-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |title=Every Star Wars movie, ranked from worst to best |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=April 12, 2017|access-date=July 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719040035/http://www.gamesradar.com/every-star-wars-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|archive-date=July 19, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was praised for an increased emphasis on action, visual effects, musical score, and costume design, but criticized for the screenplay, Christensen's performance, romantic scenes, and underdeveloped characters. It performed well in the box office, making over $653 million worldwide; however, it also became the first ''Star Wars'' film to be outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically and [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing worldwide]]. The third and final film of the prequel trilogy, ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', was released in 2005.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
The [[Galactic Republic]] is threatened by a Separatist movement organized by former [[Jedi Master]] [[Count Dooku]]. Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] comes to [[Coruscant]] to vote on a motion to create an army to assist the Jedi against the threat. Narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt upon her arrival, she is placed under the protection of Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his apprentice [[Anakin Skywalker]]. The pair thwart a second attempt on Padmé's life and subdue the assassin, [[Zam Wesell]], who is killed by her employer, a [[bounty hunter]], before she can reveal his identity. The Jedi Council instructs Obi-Wan to find the bounty hunter, while Anakin is tasked to protect Padmé and escort her back to Naboo, where the two fall in love in spite of the Jedi Code that forbids relationships.

Obi-Wan's search leads him to the mysterious ocean planet of [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]], where he discovers an army of [[Clone trooper|clone]]s being produced for the Republic in a deceased Jedi's name, with bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]] serving as their [[Genetics|genetic]] template. Obi-Wan deduces Jango to be the bounty hunter he is seeking, and after a brief battle, places a homing beacon on Jango's ship, the ''[[Slave&amp;nbsp;I]]''. Obi-Wan then follows Jango and his clone son, [[Boba Fett|Boba]], to the planet [[Geonosis]]. Meanwhile, Anakin is troubled by visions of his mother, [[Shmi]], in pain and decides to return to his homeworld of [[Tatooine]] with Padmé to save her. [[Watto]] reveals that he sold Shmi to moisture farmer [[Cliegg Lars]], who then freed and married her. Cliegg tells Anakin that she was abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]] weeks earlier and is likely dead. Determined to find his mother, Anakin ventures out and finds her at the Tusken campsite, still barely alive. After she dies in his arms, an enraged Anakin massacres the tribe. He later declares to Padmé that he will find a way to prevent the deaths of those he loves.

On Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is developing a [[battle droid|droid]] army with Trade Federation Viceroy [[Nute Gunray]] and ordered the attempts on Padmé's life. Obi-Wan transmits his findings to the Jedi Council but is subdued by Separatist droids. Dooku meets Obi-Wan in his cell and explains his role in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' formation, while implying that a large portion of the Galactic Senate is under the control of his new master, [[Darth Sidious]]. He then invites Obi-Wan to join him and stop Sidious. When Obi-Wan refuses, Dooku claims that his late master and Dooku's former apprentice [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] would have, had he been alive. Meanwhile, Senate Representative [[Jar Jar Binks]] proposes a successful vote to grant [[emergency powers]] to Chancellor Palpatine, allowing the clone army to be authorized. 

Anakin and Padmé head to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan, but are captured by Jango. Dooku sentences the trio to death, but they are saved by a battalion of clone troopers led by [[Yoda]], [[Mace Windu]], and other Jedi. Windu beheads Jango during the ensuing battle. Obi-Wan and Anakin intercept Dooku, and they engage in a [[lightsaber]] duel. Dooku injures Obi-Wan and severs Anakin's right arm, but Yoda intercepts and defends them. Dooku uses [[the Force]] to distract Yoda and escapes to Coruscant, where he delivers the plans of [[Death Star|a super-weapon]] to Sidious. As the Jedi acknowledge the beginning of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], Anakin is fitted with a robotic hand and marries Padmé on Naboo, with {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}} and [[R2-D2]] as the only witnesses.

{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}
* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]: A Jedi Master and mentor to his Padawan learner, Anakin Skywalker, who investigates the assassination attempt of Padmé which led him to discover the makings of a Clone Army. In the 10 years since ''The Phantom Menace'', he has grown wiser and more powerful in the use of [[the Force]].
* [[Hayden Christensen]] as [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]]: A former slave from [[Tatooine]] and Obi-Wan's gifted [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] apprentice who is assigned to protect Padmé with whom he falls in love.

The character was actually another Neimoidian, played by an uncredited David Healey and voiced by [[Christopher Truswell]]. [[Liam Neeson]] reprised his role as [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] from ''The Phantom Menace'', who only appears as a disembodied voice heard by Anakin while slaughtering the Tusken Raiders.

==Production==

===Writing===
After the mixed critical response to ''The Phantom Menace'', Lucas was hesitant to return to the writing desk. In March 2000, just three months before the start of principal photography, Lucas finally completed his rough draft for ''Episode II''. Lucas continued to iterate on his rough draft, producing a proper first and second draft. For help with the third draft, which would later become the shooting script, Lucas brought on [[Jonathan Hales]], who had written several episodes of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' for him, but had limited experience writing theatrical films. The final script was completed just one week before the start of principal photography.

As an in-joke, the film's [[working title]] was ''Jar Jar's Great Adventure'', a sarcastic reference to the negative fan response to the ''[[Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace|Episode I]]'' character.{{sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=531}}

In writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially decided that [[Lando Calrissian]] was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'';{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}}{{sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=158}} he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which were used by the Republic as an army in the war that followed.{{sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=162}}

===Filming===
{{see also|List of Star Wars filming locations}}
[[File:Sevilla Plaza de Espana 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.81|Plaza de España was the filming location for the Naboo palace.]]
Principal photography occurred between June 26, 2000 and September 20, 2000 at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]]. Location shooting took place in the Tunisian desert, at the [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]] in [[Seville]], [[London]], China, [[Vancouver]], [[San Diego]], and Italy ([[Villa del Balbianello]] on [[Lake Como]], and in the former royal [[Palace of Caserta]]). At his own personal request, [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s character [[Mace Windu]] received a [[lightsaber]] that emits a purple glow, as opposed to traditional blue and green for &quot;good guys&quot; and red for &quot;bad guys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Samuel L. Jackson |series=Inside the Actors Studio |serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] |airdate=June 2, 2002 |season=8 |number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reshoots were performed in March 2001. During this time, a new action sequence was developed featuring the droid factory after Lucas had decided that the film lacked a quick enough pace in the corresponding time-frame. The sequence's previsualization was rushed, and the live-action footage was shot within four and a half hours.&lt;ref name = &quot;Previz&quot;/&gt; Because of Lucas' method of creating shots through various departments and sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other, ''Attack of the Clones'' became the first film ever to be produced through what Rick McCallum called &quot;virtual filmmaking&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Previz&quot;/&gt;

Like ''The Phantom Menace'', ''Attack of the Clones'' furthered technological development, effectively moving [[Hollywood]] into the &quot;digital age&quot; with the use of the [[CineAlta|HDW-F900]], developed by [[Sony]] and [[Panavision]], a [[digital camera]] using an [[High-definition video|HD]] digital 24-frame system. This spawned controversy over the benefits and disadvantages of [[digital cinematography]] that continues as more filmmakers &quot;convert&quot; to digital filmmaking while many filmmakers oppose it. In contrast to previous installments, for which scenes were shot in the Tunisian desert in temperatures up to 125&amp;nbsp;°F (51&amp;nbsp;°C), the camera would still run without complications. Lucas had stated that he wished to film ''The Phantom Menace'' on this format but Sony was unable to build the cameras quickly enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;HereWeGo&quot;&gt;''Here We Go Again: The Digital Cinema Revolution Begins'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''Attack of the Clones'' became the third film to be released that was shot entirely on a 24p digital camera (preceded by 2001's ''[[Jackpot (2001 film)|Jackpot]]'' and ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0087768/ |title=Disney To Roll Out Pearl Harbor Again This Week |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |date=August 28, 2001|access-date=July 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410041932/http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0087768/|archive-date=April 10, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras record in the [[16:9]] [[HDCAM]] format ([[1080p]]), although the image was cropped to a 2.40:1 [[widescreen]] ratio. The area above and below the 2.40 extraction area was available for Lucas to reframe the picture as necessary in post-production.
Despite Lucas' efforts to persuade movie theaters to switch to digital projectors for viewing of ''Episode II'', few theaters did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 20, 2003 |title=Reel change |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,917542,00.html |accessdate=June 15, 2006 |location=London |first=Felicity |last=Carus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
The film relied almost solely on digital animatics as opposed to storyboards in order to previsualize sequences for editing early on in the film's production. While Lucas had used other ways of producing motion-based storyboards in the past, after ''The Phantom Menace'' the decision was made to take advantage of the growing digital technology.&lt;ref name = &quot;Previz&quot;/&gt; The process began with [[Ben Burtt]]'s creation of what the department dubbed as &quot;videomatics&quot;, so called because they were shot on a household videocamera. In these videomatics, production assistants and relatives of the department workers acted out scenes in front of [[chroma key|greenscreen]]. Using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the previsualization department later filled in the green screen with rough background footage. Burtt then cut together this footage and sent it off to Lucas for changes and approval. The result was a rough example of what the final product was intended to be. The previsualization department then created a finer version of the videomatic by creating an [[animatic]], in which the videomatic actors, props, and sets were replaced by digital counterparts to give a more precise, but still rough, look at what would eventually be seen. The animatic was later brought on set and shown to the actors so that they could understand the concept of the scene they were filming in the midst of the large amount of bluescreen used. Unlike most of the action sequences, the Battle of Geonosis was not story-boarded or created through videomatics but was sent straight to animatics after the department received a small vague page on the sequence. The intent was to create a number of small events that would be edited together for pacing inside the finished film. The animatics department was given a free hand regarding events to be created within the animatic; Lucas only asked for good action shots that he could choose from and approve later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Previz&quot;&gt;''State of the Art: The Previsualization of Episode II'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to introducing the digital camera, ''Attack of the Clones'' emphasized &quot;digital doubles&quot; as computer-generated models that doubled for actors, in the same way that traditional stunt doubles did. It also furthered the authenticity of computer-generated characters by introducing a new, completely CGI-created version of the character [[Yoda]]. Rob Coleman and [[John Knoll]] prepared two tests featuring a CGI-animated Yoda using audio from ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Yoda's appearance in ''Episode V'' also served as the reference point for the creation of the CGI Yoda; Lucas repeatedly stated to the animation department that &quot;the trick&quot; to the animation of the CGI Yoda was to make him like the puppet from which he was based, in order to maintain a flow of continuity. [[Frank Oz]] (voice and puppeteer for Yoda in the [[Original trilogy (Star Wars)|original trilogy]] and ''The Phantom Menace'') was consulted; his main piece of advice was that Yoda should look extremely old, sore, and frigid.&lt;ref name=&quot;PuppetsPixels&quot;&gt;''From Puppets to Pixels: Digital Characters in Episode II'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman later explained the process of making the digital Yoda like the puppet version, by saying &quot;When Frank [Oz] would move the head, the ears would jiggle. If we hadn't put that in, it wouldn't look like Yoda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cagle, Jess (April 29, 2002). &quot;Yoda Goes Digital-and Conquers Too&quot;, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Canadian Edition, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the acrobatics of the lightsaber fight between Count Dooku and Yoda, the then 78-year-old [[Christopher Lee]] relied on a stunt double to perform the most demanding scenes instead. Lee's face was superimposed onto the double's body in all shots other than close-ups, which he performed himself. Lucas often called the duel crucial to the animation department, as it had such potential to be humorous rather than dramatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;PuppetsPixels&quot;/&gt;

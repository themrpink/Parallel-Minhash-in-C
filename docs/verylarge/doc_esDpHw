===Modern industry===
[[File:Fragonard - PARFUMEUR Parfums Diamant.jpg|thumb|left|114px|Fragonard Diamant]]
A network of sixty companies employs 3,500 people in the city and surrounding area. Additionally about 10,000 residents of Grasse are indirectly employed by the perfume industry. Almost half of the [[business tax]] for the city comes from the perfume sector and that is ahead of [[tourism]] and services. The main activity of perfumery in Grasse is in the production of natural raw materials ([[essential oils]], [[Concrete (extraction)|concretes]], [[Absolute (fragrance)|absolutes]], [[resinoid]]s and [[molecular distillation]]) and the production of concentrate, also called the juice. A concentrate is the main product that when diluted in at least 80% alcohol provides a perfume. Also food flavorings, which developed since the 1970s, account for over half of production output today.

This represents almost half of the production of French perfumes and aromas and around 7-8% of total global activity. However, during the 1960s and 1970s large international groups gradually bought up local family factories (Chiris, [[Givaudan|Givaudan-Roure]] and Lautier, for example). Soon after their production has often been relocated overseas. Just 30 years ago most companies were focused on the production of raw materials. However an overwhelming majority of the modern fragrances contain synthetic chemicals in part or in whole. Grasse perfume companies have therefore adapted by turning to aromatic synthesis and especially to food flavorings and successfully ended a long stagnation. The Grasse perfume industry cannot compete against large chemical multinationals, but it benefits greatly from the advantage of its knowledge of raw materials, facilities, contractors, etc. In addition, major brands such as [[Dior]] and [[Chanel]] have their own plantations of roses and jasmine in the vicinity of Grasse.{{Citation Needed | reason=No sources listed, though the existing citations might cover this. | date=September 2020}}

===Perfumeries===
Three perfumeries, Fragonard, Molinard and Galimard opened their doors to the public and offer free tours that explain the processes of producing a perfume. It is possible to create one's own perfume, eau de perfume or [[eau de toilette]] and participate in all stages of manufacture from picking flowers to bottling.

* '''Galimard Perfumery''', established in 1747 by Jean de Galimard provided the Royal Court with ointments and perfumes. It is the third oldest perfume company in the world after [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina gegenüber]] and [[Floris of London]] and was revived after the war by Gaston de Fontmichel and Joseph Roux.
* '''Molinard''' was established in 1849 and their perfume bottles were made of [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]] [[Lead glass|crystal]] and [[Lalique]] glass. Clients can create their own personalized perfume during the Tarinology fragrance course workshop.
* The '''[[Fragonard Perfumery]]''' was established in 1926 in one of the oldest factories in the city. Its museum [[Fragonard Musée du Parfum]] displays rare objects that explain the history of perfumery, covering 5,000 years.
* '''International Perfume Museum'''. Opened in 1989, the museum traces the evolution of techniques during the 5,000 year history of perfumery and the large contribution of the Grasse area to perfume making. It was renovated and expanded (doubling in size) between 2007 and 2008.{{Citation Needed | reason=No sources listed, though the existing citations might cover this. | date=September 2020}}

==Main sights==
Three perfume factories offer daily tours and demonstrations, which draw in many of the region's visitors. In addition to the perfumeries, Grasse's other main attraction is the Cathedral, dedicated to Notre Dame du Puy and founded in the 11th century. In the interior, are three works by [[Rubens]] and one by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]], the French painter native of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor's Travel Guide, [http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/france/the-french-riviera/places/nice-and-the-eastern-cote-dazur/grasse Grasse, France Review], accessdate=2015-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Melvin Hicks''' (December 16, 1961 – February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist and musician. His material—encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy—was controversial and often steeped in [[black comedy|dark comedy]].

At the age of 16, while still in high school, Hicks began performing at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. During the 1980s, he toured the U.S. extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances, but it was in the UK that he amassed a significant fan base, filling large venues during his 1991 tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110420144449/http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career | url-status = dead | archive-date = April 20, 2011 | title = Bill Hicks Personal Life and Career | publisher = Bestcomedyonline.net | accessdate = August 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also achieved some recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.

Hicks died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 26, 1994, at the age of 32. In subsequent years, his work gained significant acclaim in creative circles—particularly after a series of posthumous album releases—and he developed a substantial cult following. In 2007, he was No. 6 on [[Channel 4]]'s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2007. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/1/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and rose to No. 4 on the 2010 list.&lt;ref&gt;The 100 Greatest Stand-Ups 2010. [http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/100_greatest_stand_ups/episodes/1/2/ British Comedy Guide], retrieved February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him No. 13 on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time]. Rollingstone.com, retrieved February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hicks was born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], the son of James Melvin &quot;Jim&quot; Hicks (1923–2006) and Mary Reese Hicks. He had an older sister, Lynn, and an older brother, Steve. The family lived in [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], and [[New Jersey]] before settling in [[Houston, Texas]] when Hicks was seven years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Hicks 2004&quot;&gt;''Bill Hicks: Love All the People'' (Robinson Publishing, 2005), {{ISBN|978-1-84529-111-2}}, '''page #s?'''&lt;/ref&gt; He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating [[Woody Allen]] and [[Richard Pryor]], and would write routines with his friend Dwight Slade. While attending [[Stratford High School (Houston)|Stratford High School]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHDu0p1vNy0&amp;t=3m33s Bill Hicks, recent high school graduate, performing in Houston, Texas.] (uploaded to YouTube on Jun 21, 2020)&lt;br&gt;(Hicks tells the audience that he went to Stratford High School, and recognizes a girl in the audience who went there too, who he had worked at [[Wendy's]] with.)&lt;/ref&gt; he began performing comedy (mostly derivations of Woody Allen material) for his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks (Personal Life, Career)|url=http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career?iframe=true&amp;width=95%&amp;height=95%|website=Bestcomedyonline|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At home, he would write his own one-liners and slide them under the bedroom door of Steve, who he thought was a genius, for critical analysis. Steve told him, &quot;Keep it up. You're really good at this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;True, C. ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story''. London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 2002. {{ISBN|0380803771}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Hicks began to mock his family's [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] religious beliefs. He joked to the ''[[Houston Post]]'' in 1987, &quot;We were [[Yuppie]] Baptists. We worried about things like, 'If you scratch your neighbor's [[Subaru]], should you leave a note?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father:

{{cquote|The elder Hicks would say, &quot;I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God.&quot; And Bill would counter, &quot;No it's not, Dad.&quot; &quot;Well, I believe that it is.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Bill replied, &quot;you know, some people believe that they're Napoleon. That's fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but don't share them like they're the truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;True (2002), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, he was close with his family his whole life and he did not reject spiritual ideology itself, and throughout his life he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] and other forms of spirituality. Over one [[Thanksgiving]] weekend, he took Hicks and Dwight to a Transcendental Meditation residence course in [[Galveston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = True | first= Cynthia |year =2002 | title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Paperbacks]] |isbn = 0380803771 | page = [https://archive.org/details/americanscreambi00true/page/25 &lt;!-- quote=bill hicks transcendental meditation. --&gt; 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a [[psychoanalyst]] at age 17. According to Hicks, the analyst took him aside after the first group session and told him, &quot;You can continue coming if you want to, but it's them, not you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bill Hicks 2004&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Hicks was associated with the [[Texas Outlaw Comics]] group developed at the [[Comedy Workshop]] in Houston in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wati1991&quot;&gt;Staff report (April 18, 1991). 'Texas outlaw' fires from the lip. ''[[Washington Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas, Directors (2009). ''[[American: The Bill Hicks Story]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===California and New York===
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |title=Bill Hicks |first=Paul |last=Outhwaite |publisher=Bill Hicks family official site |accessdate=2014-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220210/http://billhicks.com/Bio.html |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However his career received another upturn in 1987, when he appeared on [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s ''Young Comedians Special''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arp|first1=Robert|title=The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game (Popular Culture and Philosophy #83)|date=2014|publisher=Open Court Pub Co|isbn=978-0812698541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|title=Bio|url=http://www.billhicks.com/bio.html|website=Arizona Bay Production Company, Inc.|language=en|access-date=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626163148/http://www.billhicks.com/bio.html|archive-date=June 26, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the album ''Relentless'', he jokes that he quit using drugs because &quot;once you've been taken aboard a [[UFO]], it's kind of hard to top that&quot;, although in his performances, he continued to enthusiastically praise the virtues of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and [[psilocybin mushroom|psychedelic mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Sane Man'' and ''Rant in E Minor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually fell back to [[chain smoking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-hicks-mn0000077267/biography |title=Bill Hicks &amp;#124; Biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theme that would figure heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.

In 1988, Hicks signed on with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strongman|first1=Phil|title=Bill Hicks: 25 years on from the cult comedian's big break • The Register|url=https://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/19/feature_comedy_bill_hicks/|website=The Register|publisher=Situation Publishing|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the track &quot;Modern Bummer&quot; of his 1990 album ''[[Dangerous (Bill Hicks album)|Dangerous]]'', Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1989, he released his first video, ''Sane Man''; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-06-02/bill-hicks-sane-man/ |title=Bill Hicks ...

===Early fame===
[[File:Bill Hicks at the Laff Stop in Austin, Texas, 1991.jpg|thumb|upright|Hicks at the [[Laff Stop]] in 1991]]

In 1990, Hicks released his first album, ''Dangerous'', performed on the [[HBO]] special ''One Night Stand,'' and performed at [[Montreal]]'s ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' festival.&lt;ref name=official /&gt; He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London's West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks|url=http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|website=Icomedytv.com|accessdate=July 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703084554/http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he returned to ''Just for Laughs'' and filmed his second video, ''Relentless.''

Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the ''Marble Head Johnson'' album in 1992 collaborating with Houston high school friend [[Kevin Booth]] and Austin Texas drummer Pat Brown. During the same year he toured the UK, where he recorded the ''Revelations'' video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billhicks.com/ |title=Flash Intro Page |publisher= Bill Hicks family official site |date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Channel 4]]. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, &quot;It's Just a Ride.&quot; Also in that tour he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD titled ''Salvation.'' Hicks was voted &quot;Hot Standup Comic&quot; by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1993. He moved to Los Angeles in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Hicks and Tool===
[[Progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a [[contact lens]] he had lost.

An alternate version of the ''Ænima'' artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him &quot;Another Dead Hero&quot;, and mentions of Hicks are found both in the [[liner notes]] and on the record.

===Censorship and aftermath===
In 1984, Hicks was invited to appear on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. [[NBC]] had a policy that no handicapped jokes could be aired on the show, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as &quot;wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialistworker.org/2011/07/25/americas-outlaw-comic|title=America's outlaw comic|website=SocialistWorker.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=Quotations must be verifiably attributed to a reliable source per MOS:QUOTE}}

On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on [[CBS]], where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast: at that point the only occasion where a comedian's entire routine was cut after taping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lahr&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503|title=The Goat Boy Rises|last=Lahr|first=John|date=November 1, 1993|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430075226/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all|archivedate=April 30, 2008|authorlink=John Lahr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks's stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman's producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion]] movement, was unsuitable for broadcast.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision.&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt; Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way Hicks had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again.&lt;ref name= Lahr/&gt; Hicks was undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final ''Late Show'' appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman, and most others outside of Hicks's family, and died less than four months later.&lt;ref&gt;''True'', 2002, pp. 193–214&lt;/ref&gt;

Letterman finally aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. &quot;It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill,&quot; he said, after the set aired, &quot;because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Korn|first=Steven|title=David Letterman Airs the 'Lost' Bill Hicks Routine |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/02/03/david-letterman/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Letterman&gt;{{cite news |last=Crosbie |first=Lynn |title=The Globe Review Column; Pop Rocks; A Pop-Culture Epiphany; David Letterman's Apology to Mary Hicks |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=February 3, 2009 |page=R1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denis Leary's plagiarism===
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian [[Denis Leary]], but in 1993, he was angered by Leary's album ''[[No Cure for Cancer]]'', which featured lines and subject matter similar to his own routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Outhwaite&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt; Outhwaite, Paul (November 2003). One Consciousness: An Analysis of Bill Hicks' Comedy, 3rd edition, D.M. Productions. {{ISBN|0-9537461-3-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'' by [[Cynthia True]], upon hearing the album Hicks was furious. &quot;All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;oouuos&quot;/&gt; The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionBook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution| first1=Kevin |last1=Booth |first2= Michael|last2= Bertin| year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks's material as well as his persona and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92| archivedate = June 7, 2007| title = Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief

}}. .&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2003 [[Comedy Central Roast]] of Denis Leary, comedian [[Lenny Clarke]], a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, &quot;Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.&quot; This joke was cut from the final broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Roasting a Comic They Turn Up the Flames Gently| work=The Boston Globe| url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml| archivedate=August 11, 2003| date=August 10, 2003| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding plagiarism is also mentioned in ''American Scream'':

{{cquote|Leary was in Montreal hosting the &quot;Nasty Show&quot; at Club Soda, and Colleen [McGarr?] was coordinating the talent so she stood backstage and overheard Leary doing material incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial [[Jim Fixx]] joke: &quot;[[Keith Richards]] outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens.&quot; When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, &quot;Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks' material! Do you know that's his material?&quot; Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word, and briskly left the dressing room.&lt;ref name = &quot;oouuos&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| first=Cynthia| last=True| title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story| year=2002| publisher=Harper Paperbacks| isbn=0-380-80377-1| url=https://archive.org/details/americanscreambi00true}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Material and style==
Hicks's performance style was seen as a play on his audience's emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the [[existential]] nature of &quot;accepted truth.&quot; One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (in order to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):

{{cquote|Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ''[[Revelations (Bill Hicks)|Revelations]]'', London, 1993. The extract is part of the concluding track to the album, called &quot;It's Just a Ride&quot;, in which he essentially outlines his world view.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American philosopher and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologist]] [[Terence McKenna]] was a frequent source of Hicks's most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; he infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna's &quot;Stoned Ape&quot; model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKenna2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKenna|first1=Terrence|title=Terrence Mckenna – The stoned ape theory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StonedApe1993&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hicks – The stoned ape- theory in 3 minutes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hreGAxAjt1c|website=YouTube.com|publisher=Anders Jacobsson|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |first= Bill |last= Hicks |authorlink= Bill Hicks |year= 1997 |origyear= November 1992 – December 1993 |title= [[Rant in E-Minor]] (CD and MP3) |time= 0:58 |chapter= Pt. 1: Ch. 2: Gifts of Forgiveness |at= Track 8 |publisher= [[Rykodisc]] |oclc= 38306915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Hicks's most delivered lines was delivered during a gig in Chicago during 1989 (later released as the bootleg ''I'm Sorry, Folks''). After a [[heckler]] repeatedly shouted &quot;[[Free Bird#Legacy|Free Bird]]&quot;, Hicks screamed, &quot;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!&quot; Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased [[genocide]] during the whole of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;True, Cynthia, ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'', Pan Macmillan, 2008, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hound, Rufus, ''Stand-Up Put-Downs'', Random House during 2011, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hicks's routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a [[BBC]] interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals &quot;to everyone&quot;, he said that such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, &quot;We don't come to comedy to think!&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;Gee, where do you go to think? I'll meet you there!&quot; When asked whether there was a &quot;half way&quot; point between audience expectations and his own, he said: &quot;but my way ''is'' half-way between, I mean, this is a night-club, and, you know, these are adults, and what do you expect?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Bill, ''Love All the People: Letters, Lyrics, Routines'', Hachette UK, 2009, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks often discussed popular [[conspiracy theories]] in his performances, most notably the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He mocked the [[Warren Report]] and the official version of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] as a &quot;lone nut assassin.&quot; He also questioned the guilt of [[David Koresh]] and the [[Branch Davidian]] compound during the [[Waco Siege]]. Hicks would end some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock &quot;assassination&quot; of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.

==Illness and death==
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] that had spread to his liver.&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks-lastword&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Bill|last= Hicks| title = Last Word| url = http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html| publisher= Bill Hicks| work=Bill Hicks family official site | accessdate = June 5, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070521205803/http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html |archivedate = May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He started receiving weekly [[chemotherapy]], while still touring and also recording his album, ''Arizona Bay'', with Booth. He was also working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, titled ''Counts of the Netherworld'' for Channel 4 at the time of his death. The budget and concept had been approved, and a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was filmed. The ''Counts of the Netherworld'' pilot was shown at the various Tenth Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. After being diagnosed with cancer, Hicks would often joke that any given performance could be his last; the public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at [[Caroline's]] in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents' house in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas, shortly thereafter. In his last weeks he re-read [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;'A Brit on the side: Why American comic Bill Hicks felt most at home in the UK', 'The Independent', 25 April 2010. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/a-brit-on-the-side-why-american-comic-bill-hicks-felt-most-at-home-in-the-uk-1950403.html&lt;/ref&gt; and made telephone calls to friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Outhwaite|first1=Paul|url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html|title=Bio|publisher=Arizona Production Company, Inc.|accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

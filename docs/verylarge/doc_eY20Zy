The idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the early 20th century, though scholars do not express it today in the same terms. In Weismann's opinion the largely random process of mutation, which must occur in the [[gametes]] (or stem cells that make them) is the only source of change for natural selection to work on. Weismann became one of the first biologists to deny [[Lamarckism]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/essays/facsimile/ Essays upon heredity (1889) Oxford Clarendon Press – Full online text]. Esp.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann's ideas preceded the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work, and though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism, younger workers soon made the connection.

Weismann is much admired today. [[Ernst Mayr]] judged him to be the most important evolutionary thinker between Darwin and the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|evolutionary synthesis]] around 1930–1940, and &quot;one of the great biologists of all time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

== Life ==

=== Youth and studies ===
Weismann was born a son of high school teacher Johann (Jean) Konrad Weismann (1804–1880), a graduate of ancient languages and theology, and his wife Elise (1803–1850), née Lübbren, the daughter of the county councillor and mayor of [[Stade]], on 17 January 1834 in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He had a typical 19th century bourgeois education, receiving music lessons from the age of four, and drafting and painting lessons from [[Jakob Becker]] (1810–1872) at the Frankfurter Städelsche Institut from the age of 14. His piano teacher was a devoted butterfly collector and introduced him to the collecting of [[imago]]s and caterpillars. But studying natural sciences was out of the question due to the cost involved and limited job prospects. A friend of the family, chemist [[Friedrich Wöhler]] (1800–1882), recommended studying medicine. A foundation from the inheritance of Weismann's mother allowed him to take up studies in [[Göttingen]]. Following his graduation in 1856, he wrote his dissertation on the synthesis of [[hippuric acid]] in the human body.

=== Professional life ===
Immediately after university, Weismann took on a post as assistant at the Städtische Klinik (city clinic) in [[Rostock]]. Weismann successfully submitted two manuscripts, one about [[hippuric acid]] in herbivores, and one about the salt content of the [[Baltic Sea]], and won two prizes. The paper about the salt content dissuaded him from becoming a chemist, since he felt himself lacking in apothecarial accuracy.

After a study visit to see Vienna's museums and clinics, he visited [[Italy]] (1859) and [[Paris]] (1860). He returned to Frankfurt as personal physician to the banished [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Stephen of Austria]] at [[Schaumburg Castle, Rhineland-Palatinate|Schaumburg Castle]] from 1861 to 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Weismann, August|volume=28|page=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Second Italian War of Independence|war between Austria, France and Italy]] in 1859, he became Chief Medical Officer in the military, and on a leave from duty he walked through Northern Italy and the [[County of Tyrol]]. After a sabbatical in Paris, he worked with [[Rudolf Leuckart]] at the [[University of Gießen]]. He graduated as a physician and settled in Frankfurt with a medical practice in 1868.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

From 1863, he was [[privatdozent]] in [[comparative anatomy]] and zoology; from 1866 extraordinary professor; and from 1873 to 1912 full professor, first holder of the chair in zoology and director of the zoological institute at [[Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg]] in [[Breisgau]]. He retired in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Gaup, Ernst 1917. ''August Weismann: sein Leben und sein Werk''. Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier work was largely concerned with purely zoological investigations, one of his earliest works dealing with the development of the [[Diptera]]. Microscopical work, however, became impossible to him owing to impaired eyesight, and he turned his attention to wider problems of biological inquiry.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

==Family==

In 1867 he married Mary Dorothea Gruber.

Their son, [[:de:Julius Weismann|Julius Weismann]] (1879–1950), was a composer.

== Contributions to evolutionary biology ==
At the beginning of Weismann's preoccupation with evolutionary theory was his grappling with Christian [[creationism]] as a possible alternative. In his work ''Über die Berechtigung der Darwin'schen Theorie'' (''On the justification of the Darwinian theory'') he compared creationism and evolutionary theory, and concluded that many biological facts can be seamlessly accommodated within evolutionary theory, but remain puzzling if considered the result of acts of creation.

After this work, Weismann accepted evolution as a fact on a par with the fundamental assumptions of astronomy (e.g. [[Heliocentrism]]). Weismann's position towards the mechanism of inheritance and its role for evolution changed during his life. Three periods can be distinguished.

=== German work on cells ===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Weismann's [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is transmitted only by the [[gonad]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop afresh]] in each generation from the germ plasm.]]

Weismann's work on the demarcation between germ-line and soma can scarcely be appreciated without considering the work of (mostly) German biologists during the second half of the 19th century. This was the time that the mechanisms of cell division began to be understood. [[Eduard Strasburger]], [[Walther Flemming]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Heinrich von Waldeyer]] and the Belgian [[Edouard Van Beneden]] laid the basis for the cytology and cytogenetics of the 20th century. Strasburger, the outstanding botanical physiologist of that century, coined the terms [[nucleoplasm]] and [[cytoplasm]]. He said &quot;new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other cell nuclei&quot;. Van Beneden discovered how chromosomes combined at [[meiosis]], during the production of [[gametes]], and discovered and named [[chromatin]]. Walther Flemming, the founder of [[cytogenetics]], named [[mitosis]], and pronounced &quot;omnis nucleus e nucleo&quot; (which means the same as Strasburger's dictum). The discovery of mitosis, meiosis and chromosomes is regarded as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times,&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnegieinstitution.org/cover/top_100/ 100 Greatest Discoveries – Carnegie Institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070422/http://carnegieinstitution.org/cover/top_100/ |date=2007-09-27 }} at carnegieinstitution.org&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the 10 most important discoveries in [[cell biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.discovery.com/convergence/100discoveries/big100/biology.html The Science Channel :: 100 Greatest Discoveries: Biology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024155730/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/100discoveries/big100/biology.html |date=2006-10-24 }} at science.discovery.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Meiosis was discovered and described for the first time in [[sea urchin]] [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in 1876, by [[Oscar Hertwig]]. It was described again in 1883, at the level of chromosomes, by Van Beneden in ''[[Ascaris]]'' eggs. The ''significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance'', however, was first described in 1890 by Weismann, who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained. Thus the work of the earlier cytologists laid the ground for Weismann, who turned his mind to the consequences for evolution, which was an aspect the cytologists had not addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Although, of course, [[Ernst Haeckel]] had; but he was not a cytologist.&lt;/ref&gt; All this took place before the work of Mendel had been rediscovered

=== 1868–1881/82 ===
Weismann started out believing, like many other 19th century scientists, among them [[Charles Darwin]], that the observed variability of individuals of one species is due to the inheritance of ''sports'' (Darwin's term). He believed, as written in 1876, that transmutation of species is directly due to the influence of environment. He also wrote, &quot;if every variation is regarded as a reaction of the organism to external conditions, as a deviation of the inherited line of development, it follows that no evolution can occur without a change of the environment&quot;. (This is close to the modern use of the concept that changes in the environment can mediate selective pressures on a population, so leading to evolutionary change.) Weismann also used the classic [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] metaphor of use and disuse of an organ.

=== 1882–1895 ===
Weismann's first rejection of the [[inheritance of acquired traits]] was in a lecture in 1883, titled &quot;On inheritance&quot; (&quot;Über die Vererbung&quot;). Again, as in his treatise on creation vs. evolution, he attempts to explain individual examples with either theory. For instance, the existence of non-reproductive castes of ants, such as workers and soldiers, cannot be explained by inheritance of acquired characters. [[Germ plasm theory]], on the other hand, does so effortlessly. Weismann used this theory to explain Lamark's original examples for &quot;use and disuse&quot;, such as the tendency to have degenerate wings and stronger feet in domesticated waterfowl.

=== 1896–1910 ===
Weismann worked on the embryology of sea urchin eggs, and in the course of this observed different kinds of cell division, namely equatorial division and reductional division, terms he coined (''Äquatorialteilung'' and ''Reduktionsteilung'' respectively).

His ''germ plasm theory'' states that multicellular organisms consist of [[germ cell]]s containing heritable information, and [[somatic cells]] that carry out ordinary bodily functions. The germ cells are influenced neither by environmental influences nor by learning or morphological changes that happen during the lifetime of an organism, which information is lost after each generation. The concept as he proposed it was referred to as ''Weismannism'' in his day, for example in the book ''An examination of Weismannism'' by [[George Romanes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GJR&quot;/&gt; This idea was illuminated and explained by the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work in the early years of the 20th century (see [[Mendelian inheritance]]).

=== Experiments on the inheritance of mutilation===
The idea that germline cells contain information that passes to each generation unaffected by experience and independent of the somatic (body) cells, came to be referred to as ''the Weismann barrier'', and is frequently quoted as putting a final end to the theory of [[Lamarck]] and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. What Lamarck claimed was the inheritance of characteristics acquired through effort, or will.

Weismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 white mice, repeatedly over 5 generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. He stated that &quot;901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tollefsbol |first=Trygve |title=Handbook of Epigenetics: The New Molecular and Medical Genetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJupDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234 |year=2017 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-12-805477-2 |page=234}} Originally published in Weismann's 1889 [http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/essays/facsimile/ Essays Upon Heredity].&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann was aware of the limitations of this experiment, and made it clear that he embarked on the experiment precisely because, at the time, there were many claims of animals inheriting mutilations (he refers to a claim regarding a cat that had lost its tail having numerous tail-less offspring). There were also claims of Jews born without foreskins. None of these claims, he said, were backed up by reliable evidence that the parent had in fact been mutilated, leaving the perfectly plausible possibility that the modified offspring were the result of a mutated gene. The purpose of his experiment was to lay the claims of ''inherited mutilation'' to rest. The results were consistent with Weismann's germ plasm theory.

[[File:Cuillère MHNT ETH AC MD 110 Julien Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Spoons made out of wood, [[Betsileo people]], [[Madagascar]], 19th century]]
A '''spoon''' is a utensil consisting of a small shallow bowl (also known as a head), oval or round, at the end of a handle. A type of [[cutlery]] (sometimes called flatware in the United States), especially as part of a [[table setting|place setting]], it is used primarily for transferring food to the mouth. Spoons are also used in food preparation to measure, mix, stir and toss ingredients and for serving food. Present day spoons are made from metal (notably flat silver or [[Household silver|silverware]], plated or solid), wood, [[porcelain]] or plastic. There are a wide variety of spoons that are made of a variety of materials and by different cultures for many different uses and foods.

==History==
Preserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians include those composed of [[ivory]], [[flint]], [[slate]] and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tim_Starling/ScanSet_TIFF_demo&amp;vol=25&amp;page=ED5A755 &quot;Spoon.&quot;] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', 1911. Viewing the linked scan requires the [http://www.alternatiff.com/ AlternaTiff plugin] in most browsers. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is now in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; During the Neolithic Ozieri civilization in [[Sardinia]], ceramic [[Ladle (spoon)|ladles]] and spoons were already in use. In [[Shang Dynasty]] China, spoons were made of bone. Early bronze spoons in China were designed with a sharp point, and may have also been used as [[cutlery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Needham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Fermentations and Food Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgtFxedkgbcC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2000|author=Joseph Needham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65270-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spoons of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s were chiefly made of bronze and silver and the handle usually takes the form of a spike or pointed stem.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt; There are many examples in the [[British Museum]] from which the forms of the various types can be ascertained, the chief points of difference being found in the junction of the bowl with the handle.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt;

In the first quarter of the 18th century, the bowl becomes narrow and [[Ellipse|elliptical]], with a tongue or rat's tail down the back, and the handle is turned up at the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt;

The modern form, with the tip of the bowl narrower than the base and the rounded end of the handle turned down, came into use about 1760.&lt;ref name=&quot;enc&quot;/&gt;

[[File:English sterling silver tableware spoons.jpg|thumb|A selection of Georgian-Victorian English sterling silver tableware spoons (c. 1790  - c.1850)]]
Spoons are used primarily for eating [[liquid]] or semi-liquid foods, such as [[soup]], [[stew]] or [[ice cream]], and very small or powdery solid items which cannot be easily lifted with a [[fork]], such as [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[cereal]]s and [[Pea|green peas]]. In [[Southeast Asia]], spoons are the primary utensil used for eating; forks are used to push foods such as rice onto the spoon as well as their western usage for piercing the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.satayusa.com/southchina.htm|title=South China Seas Culture &amp; Cuisine|website=www.satayusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uktv.co.uk/food/item/aid/534144 UKTV Food: Recipes: Southeast Asian cuisine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoons are also widely used in cooking and serving. In baking, [[batter (cooking)|batter]] is usually thin enough to pour or drop from a spoon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4QnyPCAdzUC&amp;q=batter+is+usually+thin+enough+to+pour+or+drop+from+a+spoon&amp;pg=PA4027|title=Savory Baking: 75 Warm and Inspiring Recipes for Crisp, Savory Baking|last=Cech|first=Mary|date=2013-05-14|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9781452100234|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; a mixture of such consistency is sometimes called &quot;drop batter”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/schoolkitchente00lincgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/schoolkitchente00lincgoog/page/n262 242]|quote=batter is usually thin enough to pour or drop from a spoon called drop batter.|title=The School Kitchen Textbook: Lessons in Cooking and Domestic Science for the Use of Elementary Schools|last=Lincoln|first=Mary Johnson|date=1915|publisher=Little, Brown|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolled dough dropped from a spoon to a cookie sheet can be made into [[rock cake]]s and other [[cookie]]s, while [[johnnycake]] may be prepared by dropping spoonfuls of cornmeal onto a hot greased griddle.

A spoon is similarly useful in processing [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], [[sugar]] and [[syrup]]. A test sample of jelly taken from a boiling mass may be allowed to slip from a spoon in a sheet, in a step called &quot;sheeting&quot;. At the &quot;crack&quot; stage, syrup from [[boiling]] sugar may be dripped from a spoon, causing it to break with a snap when chilled. When boiled to 240&amp;nbsp;°F. and poured from a spoon, sugar forms a filament, or &quot;thread&quot;. Hot syrup is said to &quot;pearl&quot; when it forms such a long thread without breaking when dropped from a spoon.

Used for stirring, a spoon is passed through a substance with a continued circular movement for the purpose of mixing, blending, dissolving, cooling, or preventing sticking of the ingredients. Mixed drinks may be &quot;[[muddler|muddled]]&quot; by working a spoon to crush and mix ingredients such as mint and sugar on the bottom of a glass or mixer. Spoons are employed for mixing certain kinds of powder into water to make a sweet or nutritious drink.&lt;!--need more specifics; this is a strange sentence--&gt;
A spoon may also be employed to toss ingredients by mixing them lightly until they are well coated with a dressing.

For storage, spoons and knives were sometimes placed in paired ''[[decorative boxes|knife boxes]]'', which were often ornate wooden containers with sloping top, used especially during the 18th century. On the table, an ornamental utensil called a ''[[nef (napkin holder)|nef]]'', shaped like a ship, might hold a napkin, knife and spoon.

==Language and culture==
[[File:First rice.jpg|thumb|Spoon-feeding]]
Spoons can be [[Spoon (musical instrument)|used as a musical instrument]].

To ''spoon-feed'' oneself or another can simply mean to feed by means of a spoon. Metaphorically, however, it often means to present something to a person or group so thoroughly or wholeheartedly as to preclude the need of independent thought, initiative or self-reliance on the part of the recipient; or to present information in a slanted version, with the intent to preclude questioning or revision. Someone who accepts passively what has been offered in this way is said to have been spoon-fed.

A '''spoonful'''—the amount of material a spoon contains or can contain—is used as a standard [[units of measurement|unit of measure]] for volume in [[Cooking weights and measures|cooking]], where it normally signifies a '''teaspoonful'''. It is abbreviated ''coch'' or ''cochl'', from Latin ''cochleare''. &quot;Teaspoonful&quot; is often used in a similar way to describe the dosage for [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter medicines]]. [[Dessert spoon]]ful and [[tablespoon]]ful may also be found in drink and food recipes. A teaspoon holds about 5ml and a tablespoon about 15 ml.

The [[souvenir spoon]] generally exists solely as a decorative object commemorating an event, place, or special date.

For machine-made spoons, the basic shape is cut out from a sheet of [[sterling silver]], nickel silver [[alloy]] or [[stainless steel]]. The bowl is cross rolled between two pressurized rollers to produce a thinner section. The handle section is also rolled to produce the width needed for the top end. The blank is then cropped to the required shape, and two dies are used to apply the pattern to the blank. The [[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]] is then removed using a [[Linishing|linish]]er, and the bowl is formed between two dies and bent.

To make a spoon the traditional by way of [[Forge|handforging]], a bar of [[silver]] is marked up to the correct proportions for the bowl and handle.

It is then heated until red hot and held in [[tongs]] and using the [[hammer]] and [[anvil]], beaten into shape. The tip of the bar is pointed to form the tip of the bowl, then hammered to form the bowl. If a heel is to be added, a section down the centre is left thicker. The edges of the bowl and the tip of the spoon are left thicker as this is where most of the thickness is needed. The handle is then started and hammered out to length going from thick at the neck and gradually tapering down in thickness giving a balanced feel. During this process, the piece becomes very hard and has to be [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]]ed several times, then worked again until the final shape is achieved.

The bowl is filed to shape, often using a metal template. The bowl is then formed using a tin cake and spoon stake. The molten [[tin]] is poured around the spoon stake and left to harden. The handle is then bent down to 45 degrees, and the spoon is hammered into the tin using the spoon stake and a heavy hammer, to form the bowl. The bend in the handle is then adjusted to match the other spoons in the set and so it sits correctly on the table. The bowl is then [[file (tool)|file]]d level, a process called striking off. The surfaces are filed, first with a rough file to remove the fire stain from the surface, then with a smooth file. It is then buffed to remove any file marks and fire stain from inside the bowl and is polished to the desired finish.

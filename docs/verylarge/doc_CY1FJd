==Explanation of the general trends==
[[File:Atomic number to radius graph.png|thumb|A graph comparing the atomic radius of elements with atomic numbers 1–100. Accuracy of ±5 pm.]]The way the atomic radius varies with increasing [[atomic number]] can be explained by the arrangement of electrons in shells of fixed capacity.  The shells are generally filled in order of increasing radius, since the negatively [[electric charge|charged]] electrons are attracted by the positively charged [[proton]]s in the nucleus.  As the atomic number increases along each row of the periodic table, the additional electrons go into the same outermost shell; whose radius gradually contracts, due to the increasing nuclear charge.  In a noble gas, the outermost shell is completely filled; therefore, the additional electron of next alkali metal will go into the next outer shell, accounting for the sudden increase in the atomic radius.

The increasing nuclear charge is partly counterbalanced by the increasing number of electrons, a phenomenon that is known as [[shielding effect|shielding]]; which explains why the size of atoms usually increases down each column. However, there is one notable exception, known as the [[lanthanide contraction]]: the 5d block of elements are much smaller than one would expect, due to the weak shielding of the 4f electrons.

Essentially, atomic radius decreases across the periods due to an increasing number of protons. Therefore, there is a greater attraction between the protons and electrons because opposite charges attract, and more protons creates a stronger charge. The greater attraction draws the electrons closer to the protons, decreasing the size of the particle. Therefore, atomic radius decreases. Down the groups, atomic radius increases. This is because there are more energy levels and therefore a greater distance between protons and electrons. In addition, electron shielding causes attraction to decrease, so remaining electrons can go farther away from the positively charged nucleus. Therefore, size (atomic radius) increases.

The following table summarizes the main phenomena that influence the atomic radius of an element:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! factor !! principle !! increase with...  !! ''tend to'' !! effect on radius
|-
| electron shells || quantum mechanics || principal and azimuthal quantum numbers || increase down each column || increases atomic radius
|-
| nuclear charge || attractive force acting on electrons by protons in nucleus || atomic number || increase along each period (left to right) || decreases atomic radius 
|-
| shielding || repulsive force acting on outermost shell electrons by inner electrons || number of electrons in inner shells || reduce the effect of the 2nd factor || increases atomic radius 
|}

===Lanthanide contraction===
{{main|Lanthanide contraction}}
The electrons in the 4f-[[Electron shell|subshell]], which is progressively filled from [[cerium]] (''[[Atomic number|Z]]''&amp;nbsp;= 58) to [[lutetium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 71), are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the [[lanthanide]]s have atomic radii which are smaller than would be expected and which are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jolly_contract&quot;&gt;
{{cite book
 |last1=Jolly |first=W. L.
 |year=1991
 |title=Modern Inorganic Chemistry
 |page=22 |edition=2nd
 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]
 |isbn=978-0-07-112651-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[hafnium]] has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as [[zirconium]], and [[tantalum]] has an atomic radius similar to [[niobium]], and so forth.  The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to [[platinum]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 78), after which it is masked by a [[relativistic effect]] known as the [[inert pair effect]].

Due to lanthanide contraction, the 5 following observations can be drawn:

# The size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions regularly decreases with atomic number. According to [[Fajans' rules]], decrease in size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions increases the covalent character and decreases the basic character between Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and  OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in Ln(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, to the point that Yb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Lu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can dissolve with difficulty in hot concentrated NaOH. Hence the order of size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is given: &lt;br /&gt; La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ..., ... &gt; Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.
# There is a regular decrease in their ionic radii.
# There is a regular decrease in their tendency to act as a reducing agent, with increase in atomic number.
# The second and third rows of d-block transition elements are quite  close in properties.
# Consequently, these elements occur together in natural minerals and are difficult to separate.

===d-block contraction===
{{main|d-block contraction}}
The d-block contraction is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause. In this case, it is the poor shielding capacity of the 3d-electrons which affects the atomic radii and chemistries of the elements immediately following the first row of the [[transition metal]]s, from [[gallium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 31) to [[bromine]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 35).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jolly_contract&quot;/&gt;

==Notes==
* Difference between empirical and experimental data: Empirical data basically means, &quot;originating in or based on observation or experience&quot; or &quot;relying on experience or observation alone often without due regard for system and theory data&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical&lt;/ref&gt; It basically means that you measured it through physical observation, and a lot of experiments generating &lt;i&gt;the same results&lt;/i&gt;. Although, note that the values are &lt;b&gt;not calculated by a formula&lt;/b&gt;. However, often the empirical results then become an equation of estimation. Experimental data on the other hand are only based on theories. Such theoretical predictions are useful when there are no ways of measuring radii experimentally, if you want to predict the radius of an element that hasn't been discovered yet, or it has too short of a half-life.

The '''kilogram per cubic metre''' (symbol: '''kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''', or '''kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''') is an [[SI derived unit]] of [[density]], defined by [[mass]] in [[kilogram]]s divided by [[volume]] in [[cubic metre]]s.

==Conversions==
1&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to:
: = 0.001 [[gram per cubic centimetre|g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] (exactly)
: ≈ 0.06243 [[pound (mass)|lb]]/[[foot (unit)|ft]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately)
: ≈ 0.1335 [[ounce|oz]]/[[gallon|gal]]{{clarify|which variety of gallon?|date=February 2020}} (approximately)

1 [[gram per cubic centimetre|g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,000,000 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (exactly)

1 lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 16.02&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately)

1 oz/gal{{clarify|which variety of gallon?|date=February 2020}} ≈ 7.489&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately)

==Relation to other measures==
The kilogram was originally based on the mass of one litre of water, thus the density of water is about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In [[chemistry]], g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is more commonly used.

{{short description|Process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons, primarily protons and neutrons}}
'''Nucleosynthesis''' is the process that creates new [[atomic nuclei]] from pre-existing [[nucleon]]s (protons and neutrons) and nuclei. According to current theories, the first nuclei were formed a few minutes after the [[Big Bang]], through nuclear reactions in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. After about 20 minutes, the universe had expanded and cooled to a point at which these high-energy collisions among nucleons ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75% [[hydrogen]], 24% [[helium]] by mass. The rest is traces of other elements such as [[lithium]] and the hydrogen [[isotope]] [[deuterium]]. Nucleosynthesis in stars and their explosions later produced the variety of elements and isotopes that we have today, in a process called cosmic chemical evolution. The amounts of total mass in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (called 'metals' by astrophysicists) remains small (few percent), so that the universe still has approximately the same composition.

Stars [[stellar fusion|fuse]] light elements to heavier ones in their [[stellar core|cores]], giving off energy in the process known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Nuclear fusion reactions create many of the lighter elements, up to and including [[iron]] and [[nickel]] in the most massive stars. Products of stellar nucleosynthesis mostly remain trapped in stellar cores and remnants, except if ejected through stellar winds and explosions.  The neutron capture reactions of the r-process and [[s-process]] create heavier elements, from iron upwards.

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] within exploding stars is largely responsible for the elements between [[oxygen]] and [[rubidium]]: from the ejection of elements produced during stellar nucleosynthesis; through explosive nucleosynthesis during the supernova explosion; and from the [[r-process]] (absorption of multiple neutrons) during the explosion.

[[Neutron star merger]]s are a recently discovered candidate source of elements produced in the [[r-process]]. When two neutron stars collide, a significant amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected, including newly formed nuclei.

[[Cosmic ray spallation]] is a process wherein [[cosmic rays]] impact the nuclei of the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic nuclei. It is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt;B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.

Cosmic ray bombardment of solar-system material found on Earth (including meteorites) also contribute to the presence on Earth of [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s. On Earth, no new nuclei are produced, except in nuclear laboratories that reproduce the above nuclear reactions with particle beams. Natural radioactivity [[radiogenesis]] (decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium is the only exception, leading to an increase in the daughter nuclei of such natural decays.

==Timeline==
[[File:Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg|thumb|600px|Periodic table showing the currently believed origins of each element. Elements from carbon up to sulfur may be made in stars of all masses by charged-particle fusion reactions. Iron group elements originate mostly from the nuclear-statistical equilibrium process in thermonuclear supernova explosions. Elements beyond iron are made in high-mass stars with slow neutron capture ([[s-process]]), and by rapid neutron capture in the [[r-process]], with origins being debated among rare supernova variants and compact-star collisions. Note that this graphic is a first-order simplification of an active research field with many open questions.]]

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves were formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] during the [[Big Bang]] as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes afterwards, starting with only [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, nuclei up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]] (both with mass number 7) were formed, but hardly any other elements. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant [[carbon]] could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand. This first process, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe, creating the so-called [[primordial element]]s.

A star formed in the early universe produces heavier elements by combining its lighter nuclei{{snd}}[[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]{{snd}}which were found in the initial composition of the interstellar medium and hence the star. Interstellar gas therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements, which are present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang, and also [[cosmic ray spallation]]. These lighter elements in the present universe are therefore thought to have been produced through billions of years of [[cosmic ray]] (mostly high-energy proton) mediated breakup of heavier elements in interstellar gas and dust. The fragments of these cosmic-ray collisions include [[helium-3]] and the stable isotopes of the light elements lithium, beryllium, and boron. Carbon was not made in the Big Bang, but was produced later in larger stars via the [[triple-alpha process]].

The subsequent nucleosynthesis of heavier elements (''Z''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;6, carbon and heavier elements) requires the extreme temperatures and pressures found within [[star]]s and [[supernova]]e. These processes began as hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang collapsed into the first stars after about 500 million years. Star formation has been occurring continuously in galaxies since that time. The entire variety of the elements and isotopes found in today's universe were created by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]], and by nucleosynthesis in exotic events such as neutron star collisions. On Earth, mixing and evaporation has altered this composition to what is called the natural terrestrial composition. The heavier elements produced after the Big Bang range in [[atomic number]]s from ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 ([[carbon]]) to ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;94 ([[plutonium]]). Synthesis of these elements occurred through nuclear reactions involving the strong and weak interactions among nuclei, and called [[nuclear fusion]] (including both [[r-process|rapid]] and [[s-process|slow]] multiple neutron capture), and include also [[nuclear fission]] and radioactive decays such as [[beta decay]]. The stability of atomic nuclei of different sizes and composition (i.e. numbers of neutrons and protons) plays an important role in the possible reactions among nuclei. Cosmic nucleosynthesis, therefore, is studied among researchers of astrophysics and nuclear physics (&quot;[[nuclear astrophysics]]&quot;).

==History of nucleosynthesis theory==
The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that the [[chemical elements]] were created at the beginning of the universe, but no rational physical scenario for this could be identified. Gradually it became clear that hydrogen and helium are much more abundant than any of the other elements. All the rest constitute less than 2% of the mass of the Solar System, and of other star systems as well. At the same time it was clear that oxygen and carbon were the next two most common elements, and also that there was a general trend toward high abundance of the light elements, especially those with isotopes composed of whole numbers of helium-4 nuclei ([[alpha nuclide]]s).

[[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] first suggested in 1920, that stars obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen into helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements may also form in stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddington |first1=A.

In the years immediately before World War II, [[Hans Bethe]] first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.

[[Fred Hoyle]]'s original work on nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars, occurred just after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Actually, before the war ended, he learned about the problem of spherical implosion of [[plutonium]] in the [[Manhattan project]]. He saw an analogy between the plutonium fission reaction and the newly discovered supernovae, and he was able to show that exploding super novae produced all of the elements in the same proportion as existed on Earth. He felt that he had accidentally fallen into a subject that would make his career. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1983/fowler-autobio.html Autobiography William A. Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt; His work explained the production of all heavier elements, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen is continuously created in the universe from vacuum and energy, without need for universal beginning.

Hoyle's work explained how the abundances of the elements increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from [[William A. Fowler]], [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]], and [[Donald D. Clayton]], followed by many others. The [[B2FH paper|seminal 1957 review paper]] by [[Margaret Burbidge|E. M. Burbidge]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge|G. R. Burbidge]], Fowler and Hoyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burbidge |first1=E. M. |last2=Burbidge |first2=G. R. |last3=Fowler |first3=W.

That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.

The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, who suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no further. This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a &quot;primeval atom&quot;, to a state before which time and space did not exist. Hoyle is credited with coining the term &quot;Big Bang&quot; during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying that Lemaître's theory was &quot;based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.&quot; It is popularly reported that Hoyle intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models. Lemaître's model was needed to explain the existence of deuterium and nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the fundamentally high amount of helium present, not only in stars but also in interstellar space. As it happened, both Lemaître and Hoyle's models of nucleosynthesis would be needed to explain the elemental abundances in the universe.

The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes from the perspective of natural processes. The primary stimulus to the development of this theory was the shape of a plot of the abundances versus the atomic number of the elements. Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that varies by factors up to ten million. A very influential stimulus to nucleosynthesis research was an abundance table created by [[Hans Suess]] and [[Harold Urey]] that was based on the unfractionated abundances of the non-volatile elements found within unevolved meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suess |first1=Hans E. |last2=Urey |first2=Harold C. |title=Abundances of the Elements |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |date=1956 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=53–74 |bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a graph of the abundances is displayed on a logarithmic scale below, where the dramatically jagged structure is visually suppressed by the many powers of ten spanned in the vertical scale of this graph.

[[Image:SolarSystemAbundances.svg|thumb|center|800px|Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar System. Hydrogen and helium are most common, residuals within the paradigm of the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stiavelli |first1=Massimo |year=2009 |title=From First Light to Reionization the End of the Dark Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCLNBElRTS4C&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location=Weinheim, Germany |isbn=9783527627370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance of elements according to whether they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Within this trend is a peak at abundances of iron and nickel, which is especially visible on a logarithmic graph spanning fewer powers of ten, say between logA=2 (A=100) and logA=6 (A=1,000,000).]]

==Processes==
There are a number of [[astrophysical]] processes which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur within stars, and the chain of those [[nuclear fusion]] processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the [[proton-proton chain]] or the [[CNO cycle]]), [[Helium fusion|helium burning]], [[Carbon burning process|carbon burning]], [[Neon burning process|neon burning]], [[Oxygen burning process|oxygen burning]] and [[silicon burning process|silicon burning]]. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest [[binding energy]] per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the [[s-process]] or in explosive environments, such as [[supernova]]e and [[neutron star merger]]s, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the [[r-process]], which involves rapid neutron captures, the [[rp-process]], and the [[p-process]] (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the [[photodisintegration]] of existing nuclei.

==Major types==

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
{{main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pdg.lbl.gov/2017/mobile/reviews/pdf/rpp2016-rev-bbang-nucleosynthesis-m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; occurred within the first three minutes of the beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[hydrogen-1|protium]]), &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H (D, [[deuterium]]), &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-3]]), and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-4]]). Although &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and [[alpha decay]]s and trace amounts of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H continue to be produced by [[spallation]] and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the [[Big Bang]]. The nuclei of these elements, along with some &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial [[quark–gluon plasma]] froze out to form [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than [[beryllium]] (or possibly [[boron]]) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Stellar nucleosynthesis===

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nuclear process by which new nuclei are produced. It occurs in stars during [[stellar evolution]]. It is responsible for the galactic abundances of elements from [[carbon]] to [[iron]]. Stars are thermonuclear furnaces in which H and He are fused into heavier nuclei by increasingly high temperatures as the composition of the core evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=1983 |title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofstel0000clay/page/ |url-access=registration |at=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofstel0000clay/page/ Chapter 5] |edition=Reprint |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-10952-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is carbon because its formation from He is a bottleneck in the entire process. Carbon is produced by the [[triple-alpha process]] in all stars. Carbon is also the main element that causes the release of free neutrons within stars, giving rise to the [[s-process]], in which the slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier than iron and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D.

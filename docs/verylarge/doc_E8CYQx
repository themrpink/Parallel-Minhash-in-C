The '''Axis powers''' ({{lang-de|Achsenmächte}}; {{lang-it|Potenze dell'Asse}}; {{lang-ja|枢軸国}} ''Sūjikukoku''), also known as &quot;'''Rome–Berlin–Tokyo Axis'''&quot; was a [[military alliance]] that fought in [[World War II]] against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.

The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term &quot;Axis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GlobSec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937 and Hungary and Spain joined in 1939. The &quot;Rome–Berlin Axis&quot; became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called &quot;[[Pact of Steel]]&quot;, with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan. As such the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], the [[Tripartite Pact]], and the [[Pact of Steel]] were the agreements that formed the main basis of the Axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooke1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooke |first1=Tim |title=History of World War II: Volume 1 - Origins and Outbreak |date=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=0761474838 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKDhPHvv_c0C&amp;q=%22Tripartite+pact%22+%22The+axis%22+%22anti-comintern+pact%22&amp;pg=PA154 |accessdate=28 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its zenith in 1942 during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.

==Origins and creation==
{{Fascism sidebar}}
{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}
The term &quot;axis&quot; was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that &quot;there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin&quot; (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and Günter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;D. C. Watt, &quot;The Rome–Berlin Axis, 1936–1940: Myth and Reality&quot;, ''The Review of Politics'', 22: 4 (1960), pp. 530–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]]'s prime minister [[Gyula Gömbös]] when advocating an alliance of Hungary with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Gömbös' efforts did affect the Italo-Hungarian [[Rome Protocols]], but his sudden death in 1936 while negotiating with Germany in [[Munich]] and the arrival of [[Kálmán Darányi]], his successor, ended Hungary's involvement in pursuing a trilateral axis.{{sfn|Sinor|1959|p=291}} Contentious negotiations between the Italian foreign minister, [[Galeazzo Ciano]], and the German ambassador, [[Ulrich von Hassell]], resulted in a [[Nineteen-Point Protocol]], signed by Ciano and his German counterpart, [[Konstantin von Neurath]], in 1936. When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome–Berlin axis.&lt;ref name=Watt/&gt;

===Initial proposals of a German–Italian alliance===
Italy under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming head of government in Italy as leader of the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement, Mussolini had advocated alliance with defeated Germany after the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 settled World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; He believed that Italy could expand its influence in Europe by allying with Germany against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; In early 1923, as a goodwill gesture to Germany, Italy secretly delivered weapons for the German Army, which had faced major disarmament under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00143, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gustav Stresemann]], ''Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1923, foreign minister of Germany, 1923–1929]]
In September 1923, Mussolini offered German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] a &quot;common policy&quot;: he sought German military support against potential French military intervention over Italy's diplomatic dispute with Yugoslavia over [[Free State of Fiume|Fiume]], should an Italian seizure of Fiume result in war between Italy and Yugoslavia. The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt;

During the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;&gt;Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Streseman]] as German foreign minister in 1925 declared that the reincorporation of territories lost to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] in the Treaty of Versailles was a major task of German foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;/&gt; The ''Reichswehr'' Ministry memorandum of 1926 declared its intention to seek the reincorporation of German territory lost to Poland as its first priority, to be followed by the return of the Saar territory, the annexation of Austria, and remilitarization of the Rhineland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian Leitz p10&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1920s Italy had identified the year 1935 as a crucial date for preparing for a war against France, as 1935 was the year when Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles were scheduled to expire.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor Knox. Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch. ''Mussolini and His Generals: The Armed Forces and Fascist Foreign Policy, 1922–1940''. Cambridge University Press, 2007. P11.&lt;/ref&gt;

However at this time Mussolini stressed one important condition that Italy must pursue in an alliance with Germany: that Italy &quot;must&amp;nbsp;... tow them, not be towed by them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124&quot;/&gt; Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of &quot;decisive weight&quot;, involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; However Grandi stressed that Italy must seek to avoid becoming a &quot;slave of the rule of three&quot; in order to pursue its interests, arguing that although substantial Italo-French tensions existed, Italy would not unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with Germany, just as it would neither unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with France over conceivable Italo-German tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Grandi's attempts to maintain a diplomatic balance between France and Germany were challenged in 1932 by pressure from the French, who had begun to prepare an alliance with Britain and the United States against the threat of a revanchist Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The French government warned Italy that it had to choose whether to be on the side of the pro-Versailles powers or that of the anti-Versailles revanchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Grandi responded that Italy would be willing to offer France support against Germany if France gave Italy its mandate over Cameroon and allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; France refused Italy's proposed exchange for support, as it believed Italy's demands were unacceptable and the threat from Germany was not yet immediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

On 23 October 1932, Mussolini declared support for a Four Power Directorate that included Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to bring about an orderly treaty revision outside of what he considered the outmoded [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; The proposed Directorate was pragmatically designed to reduce French hegemony in continental Europe, in order to reduce tensions between the great powers in the short term to buy Italy relief from being pressured into a specific war alliance while at the same time allowing them to benefit from diplomatic deals on treaty revisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

===Danube alliance, dispute over Austria===
[[File:Gombos Gyula.png|thumb|upright|[[Gyula Gömbös]], ''Prime Minister of Hungary'', 1932–1936]]

In 1932, Gyula Gömbös and the [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] rose to power in Hungary, and immediately sought an alliance with Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Gömbös sought to alter Hungary's post–[[Treaty of Trianon]] borders, but knew that Hungary alone was not capable of challenging the [[Little Entente]] powers by forming an alliance with Austria and Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini was elated by Gömbös' offer of alliance with Italy, and they cooperated in seeking to persuade Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] to join a tripartite economic agreement with Italy and Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; At the meeting between Gömbös and Mussolini in Rome on 10 November 1932, the question came up of the sovereignty of Austria in relation to the predicted rise to power in Germany of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini was worried about Nazi ambitions towards Austria, and indicated that at least in the short term he was committed to maintaining Austria as a sovereign state.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Italy had concerns over a Germany which included Austria laying land claims to German-populated territories of the [[South Tyrol]] (also known as Alto-Adige) within Italy, which bordered Austria on the [[Brenner Pass]]. Gömbös responded to Mussolini that as the Austrians primarily identified as Germans, the [[Anschluss]] of Austria to Germany was inevitable, and advised that it would be better for Italy to have a friendly Germany across the [[Brenner Pass]] than a hostile Germany bent on entering the Adriatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt; Mussolini said he hoped the Anschluss could be postponed as long as possible until the breakout of a European war that he estimated would begin in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Adolf Hitler Berghof-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Führer and Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1933–1945]]
In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi Party [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany. His first diplomatic visitor was Gömbös. In a letter to Hitler within a day of his being appointed Chancellor, Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to Germany to remind Hitler &quot;that ten years ago, on the basis of our common principles and ideology, we were in contact via Dr. Scheubner-Richter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Iván T. Berend, Tibor Iván Berend. ''Decades of Crisis: Central and Eastern Europe Before World War 2''. First paperback edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 2001. P. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Gömbös told the Hungarian ambassador to inform Hitler of Hungary's intentions &quot;for the two countries to cooperate in foreign and economic policy&quot;.

Hitler had advocated an alliance between Germany and Italy since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941: The Road to Global War. Pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being appointed Chancellor, Hitler sent a personal message to Mussolini, declaring &quot;admiration and homage&quot; and declaring his anticipation of the prospects of German-Italian friendship and even alliance.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware that Italy held concerns over potential German land claims on South Tyrol, and assured Mussolini that Germany was not interested in South Tyrol. Hitler in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had declared that South Tyrol was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German–Italian alliance. After Hitler's rise to power, the Four Power Directorate proposal by Italy had been looked at with interest by Britain, but Hitler was not committed to it, resulting in Mussolini urging Hitler to consider the diplomatic advantages Germany would gain by breaking out of isolation by entering the Directorate and avoiding an immediate armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Power Directorate proposal stipulated that Germany would no longer be required to have limited arms and would be granted the right to re-armament under foreign supervision in stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn2&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler completely rejected the idea of controlled rearmament under foreign supervision.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn2&quot;/&gt;

Mussolini did not trust Hitler's intentions regarding Anschluss nor Hitler's promise of no territorial claims on South Tyrol.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini informed Hitler that he was satisfied with the presence of the anti-Marxist government of Dollfuss in Austria, and warned Hitler that he was adamantly opposed to Anschluss.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt; Hitler responded in contempt to Mussolini that he intended &quot;to throw Dollfuss into the sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt; With this disagreement over Austria, relations between Hitler and Mussolini steadily became more distant.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn3&quot;/&gt;

Hitler attempted to break the impasse with Italy over Austria by sending [[Hermann Göring]] to negotiate with Mussolini in 1933 to convince Mussolini to press the Austrian government to appoint members of Austria's Nazis to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;&gt;H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918–1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Göring claimed that Nazi domination of Austria was inevitable and that Italy should accept this, as well as repeating to Mussolini of Hitler's promise to &quot;regard the question of the South Tyrol frontier as finally liquidated by the peace treaties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt; In response to Göring's visit with Mussolini, Dollfuss immediately went to Italy to counter any German diplomatic headway.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt; Dollfuss claimed that his government was actively challenging Marxists in Austria and claimed that once the Marxists were defeated in Austria, that support for Austria's Nazis would decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgwyn4&quot;/&gt;

In June 1934, Hitler and Mussolini met for the first time, in [[Venice]]. The meeting did not proceed amicably. Hitler demanded that Mussolini compromise on Austria by pressuring Dollfuss to appoint Austrian Nazis to his cabinet, to which Mussolini flatly refused the demand. In response, Hitler promised that he would accept Austria's independence for the time being, saying that due to the internal tensions in Germany (referring to sections of the Nazi SA that Hitler would soon kill in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]) that Germany could not afford to provoke Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;neville&quot;&gt;Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. London, England: Routledge, 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galeazzo Ciano]] told the press that the two leaders had made a &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; to avoid interfering in Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;knickerbocker1941&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;pg=PA7 | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=7–8| isbn=9781417992775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pp. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was outraged as he held Hitler directly responsible for the assassination that violated Hitler's promise made only weeks ago to respect Austrian independence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville.

Pp.&amp;nbsp;123–125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|knickerbocker1941}} Mussolini rapidly deployed several army divisions and air squadrons to the Brenner Pass, and warned that a German move against Austria would result in war between Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel. ''Origins of Second World War Reconsidered: A. J. P. Taylor and Historians''. Digital Printing edition. Routledge, 2003. Pp. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler responded by both denying Nazi responsibility for the assassination and issuing orders to dissolve all ties between the German Nazi Party and its Austrian branch, which Germany claimed was responsible for the political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel. ''Austrian Foreign Policy in Historical Context''. New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA: Transaction Publishers, 2006. Pp. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy effectively abandoned diplomatic relations with Germany while turning to France in order to challenge Germany's intransigence by signing a Franco-Italian accord to protect Austrian independence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neville. ''Mussolini''. London, England: Routledge, 2004. Pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; French and Italian military staff discussed possible military cooperation involving a war with Germany should Hitler dare to attack Austria.

Relations between Germany and Italy recovered due to Hitler's support of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, while other countries condemned the invasion and advocated sanctions against Italy.

===Development of German–Italian–Japanese alliance===

[[File:Hideo Kodama 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hideo Kodama]], a wartime cabinet minister in the Empire of Japan.]]

Interest in Germany and Japan in forming an alliance began when Japanese diplomat [[Oshima Hiroshi]] visited [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in Berlin in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; Oshima informed von Ribbentrop of Japan's interest in forming a German–Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Von Ribbentrop expanded on Oshima's proposal by advocating that the alliance be based in a political context of a pact to oppose the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; The proposed pact was met with mixed reviews in Japan, with a faction of ultra-nationalists within the government supporting the pact while the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Foreign Ministry were staunchly opposed to the pact.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; There was great concern in the Japanese government that such a pact with Germany could disrupt Japan's relations with Britain, endangering years of a beneficial Anglo-Japanese accord, that had allowed Japan to ascend in the international community in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the pact was met with similar division in Germany; while the proposed pact was popular amongst the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, it was opposed by many in the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the business community who held financial interests in China to which Japan was hostile.

[[File:OKAWA Shumei.jpg|thumb|upright|Japanese writer [[Shūmei Ōkawa]], a key exponent of Japanese nationalism.]]

On learning of German–Japanese negotiations, Italy also began to take an interest in forming an alliance with Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Italy had hoped that due to Japan's long-term close relations with Britain, that an Italo-Japanese alliance could pressure Britain into adopting a more accommodating stance towards Italy in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1936, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano informed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, &quot;I have heard that a Japanese–German agreement concerning the Soviet Union has been reached, and I think it would be natural for a similar agreement to be made between Italy and Japan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; Initially Japan's attitude towards Italy's proposal was generally dismissive, viewing a German–Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union as imperative while regarding an Italo-Japanese alliance as secondary, as Japan anticipated that an Italo-Japanese alliance would antagonize Britain that had condemned Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; This attitude by Japan towards Italy altered in 1937 after the League of Nations condemned Japan for aggression in China and faced international isolation, while Italy remained favourable to Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;boscaro&quot;/&gt; As a result of Italy's support for Japan against international condemnation, Japan took a more positive attitude towards Italy and offered proposals for a non-aggression or neutrality pact with Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Boscaro, Franco Gatti, Massimo Raveri, (eds). ''Rethinking Japan. 1. Literature, visual arts &amp; linguistics''. Pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tripartite Pact was signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan on 27 September 1940, in Berlin. The pact was subsequently joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Slovakia (24 November 1940), and Bulgaria (1 March 1941).{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=91}}

==Ideology==

The Axis powers' primary goal was [[Expansionism|territorial expansion]] at the expense of their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Baranowski. ''Axis Imperialism in the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In ideological terms, the Axis described their goals as breaking the hegemony of the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] [[Western world|Western powers]] and defending civilization from [[communism]]. The Axis championed a number of variants on [[fascism]], [[militarism]], and [[autarky]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic resources==
The Axis population in 1938 was 258.9&amp;nbsp;million, while the Allied population (excluding the Soviet Union and the United States, which later joined the Allies) was 689.7&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}} Thus the Allied powers outnumbered the Axis powers by 2.7 to 1.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=4}} The leading Axis states had the following domestic populations: Germany 75.5&amp;nbsp;million (including 6.8&amp;nbsp;million from recently annexed [[Austria]]), Japan 71.9&amp;nbsp;million (excluding its colonies), and Italy 43.4&amp;nbsp;million (excluding its colonies). The United Kingdom (excluding its colonies) had a population of 47.5&amp;nbsp;million and France (excluding its colonies) 42&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=3}}

The wartime [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the Axis was $911&amp;nbsp;billion at its highest in 1941 in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]] by 1990 prices.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10}} The GDP of the Allied powers was $1,798&amp;nbsp;billion. The United States stood at $1,094&amp;nbsp;billion, more than the Axis combined.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=10, 25}}

The burden of the war upon participating countries has been measured through the percentage of [[gross national product]] (GNP) devoted to military expenditures.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Nearly one-quarter of Germany's GNP was committed to the war effort in 1939, and this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944, prior to the collapse of the economy.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} In 1939, Japan committed 22 percent of its GNP to its war effort in China; this rose to three-quarters of GNP in 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} Italy did not mobilize its economy; its GNP committed to the war effort remained at prewar levels.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Italy and Japan lacked industrial capacity; their economies were small, dependent on [[international trade]], external sources of fuel and other industrial resources.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}} As a result, Italian and Japanese mobilization remained low, even by 1943.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=20}}

Among the three major Axis powers, Japan had the lowest per capita income, while Germany and Italy had an income level comparable to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Harrison|2000|p=19}}

====War justifications====
Hitler in 1941 described the outbreak of World War II as the fault of the intervention of Western powers against Germany during its war with Poland, describing it as the result of &quot;the European and American warmongers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis Copeland 1999 Pp. 485&quot;&gt;Lewis Copeland, Lawrence W. Lamm, Stephen J. McKenna. ''The World's Great Speeches: Fourth Enlarged (1999) Edition''. Pp. 485.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler had designs for Germany to become the dominant and leading state in the world, such as his intention for Germany's capital of Berlin to become the ''Welthauptstadt'' (&quot;World Capital&quot;), renamed [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania]].&lt;ref&gt;Hitler's Germany: Origins, Interpretations, Legacies. London, England: Routledge, 1939. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The German government also justified its actions by claiming that Germany inevitably needed to territorially expand because it was facing an [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] crisis that Hitler described: &quot;We are overpopulated and cannot feed ourselves from our own resources&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237&quot;&gt;Stephen J. Lee. Europe, 1890–1945. P. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus expansion was justified as an inevitable necessity to provide ''[[lebensraum]]'' (&quot;living space&quot;) for the German nation and end the country's overpopulation within existing confined territory, and provide resources necessary to its people's well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237&quot;/&gt; Since the 1920s, the Nazi Party publicly promoted the expansion of Germany into territories held by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter D. Stachura P. 31&quot;&gt;Peter D. Stachura. The Shaping of the Nazi State. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Germany justified its war against Poland on the issues of German minority within Poland and Polish opposition to the incorporation of the ethnically German-majority [[Free City of Danzig]] into Germany. While Hitler and the Nazi party before taking power openly talked about destroying Poland and were hostile to Poles, after gaining power until February 1939 Hitler tried to conceal his true intentions towards Poland, and signed a 10-year Non-Aggression Pact in 1934,  revealing his plans to only to his closest associates.&lt;ref&gt;Stutthof.

Mirosław Gliński Geneza obozu koncentracyjnego Stutthof na tle hitlerowskich przygotowan w Gdansku do wojny z Polska&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Germany and Poland altered from the early to the late 1930s, as Germany sought rapprochement with Poland to avoid the risk of Poland entering the Soviet sphere of influence, and appealed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jan Karski 2014.

A [[Danzig crisis|diplomatic crisis erupted]] following Hitler demanding that the Free City of Danzig be annexed to Germany, as it was led by a Nazi government seeking annexation to Germany. Germany used legal precedents to justify its intervention against Poland and annexation of the [[Free City of Danzig]] (led by a local Nazi government that sought incorporation into Germany) in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;C. Kiss. 1989&quot;&gt;A. C. Kiss. ''Hague Yearbook of International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Poland rejected Germany's demands and Germany in response prepared a general mobilization on the morning of 30 August 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Young 2006.

Germany justified its invasion of the [[Low Countries]] of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in May 1940 by claiming that it suspected that Britain and France were preparing to use the Low Countries to launch an invasion of the industrial [[Ruhr]] region of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649&quot;&gt;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald. ''Documents and Cases, Volumes 1–2''. The Hague, Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2000. P. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; When war between Germany versus Britain and France appeared likely in May 1939, Hitler declared that the Netherlands and Belgium would need to be occupied, saying: &quot;Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied&amp;nbsp;... Declarations of neutrality must be ignored&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649&quot;/&gt; In a conference with Germany's military leaders on 23 November 1939, Hitler declared to the military leaders that &quot;We have an [[Achilles heel]], the Ruhr&quot;, and said that &quot;If England and France push through Belgium and Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest danger&quot;, and thus claimed that Belgium and the Netherlands had to be occupied by Germany to protect Germany from a British-French offensive against the Ruhr, irrespective of their claims to neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabrielle Kirk McDonald 2000. P. 649&quot;/&gt;

Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 involved issues of ''lebensraum'', [[anti-communism]], and Soviet foreign policy.  After Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Nazi regime's stance towards an independent, territorially-reduced Russia was affected by pressure beginning in 1942 from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] on Hitler to endorse a Russian army led by [[Andrey Vlasov]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Hosking. ''Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union''. Harvard University Press, 2006 P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the proposal to support an anti-communist Russian army was met with outright rejection by Hitler, however by 1944 as Germany faced mounting losses on the Eastern Front, Vlasov's forces were recognized by Germany as an ally, particularly by [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Andreyev. ''Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet Reality and Emigré Theories''. First paperback edition. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Pp. 53, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, Germany supported Japan by declaring war on the US. During the war Germany denounced the [[Atlantic Charter]] and the [[Lend-Lease Act]] that the US adopted to support the Allied powers prior to entry into the alliance, as imperialism directed at dominating and exploiting countries outside of the continental [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall Bennett Woods 1990. P. 200&quot;&gt;Randall Bennett Woods. ''A Changing of the Guard: Anglo-American Relations, 1941–1946''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. P. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler denounced American President Roosevelt's invoking of the term &quot;freedom&quot; to describe US actions in the war, and accused the American meaning of &quot;freedom&quot; to be the freedom for democracy to exploit the world and the freedom for plutocrats within such democracy to exploit the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall Bennett Woods 1990.

====History====

At the end of World War I, German citizens felt that their country had been humiliated as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which included a [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|war guilt clause]] and forced Germany to pay enormous reparations payments and forfeit territories formerly controlled by the German Empire and all its colonies. The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (&quot;living space&quot;) in eastern Europe.

Germany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].

On 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.

====Occupied territories====
{{further|Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe}}

The [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was created from the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.

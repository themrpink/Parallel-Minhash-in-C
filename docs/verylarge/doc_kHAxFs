Fort Laramie was the end of most cholera outbreaks which killed thousands along the lower Platte and North Platte from 1849 to 1855. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal—up to 30&amp;nbsp;percent of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails&quot;.

After crossing the South Platte the trail continues up the North Platte River, crossing many small swift-flowing creeks. As the North Platte veers to the south, the trail crosses the North Platte to the Sweetwater River Valley, which heads almost due west. [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] is on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the [[Continental Divide]] at South Pass, Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing [[Big Sandy River (Wyoming)|Big Sandy Creek]]&amp;mdash;about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1|foot}} deep&amp;mdash;before hitting the Green River. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The deep, wide, swift, and treacherous Green River which eventually empties into the Colorado River, was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green, the main trail continued approximately southwest until the [[Blacks Fork]] of the Green River and Fort Bridger. From Fort Bridger the Mormon Trail continued southwest following the upgraded [[Hastings Cutoff]] through the [[Wasatch Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://scienceviews.com/historical/hastingsintro.html |title = The Hastings Cutoff Introduction |website = scienceviews.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the Bear River Valley. The trail turned north following the Bear River past the terminus of the [[California Trail#South Pass to Humboldt River|Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff]] at Smiths Fork and on to the Thomas Fork Valley at the present Wyoming&amp;ndash;Idaho border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/cokeville.html |title = Lincoln County Photos II-Wyoming Tales and Trails |publisher = Wyomingtalesandtrails.com |date = June 30, 1952 |access-date = March 19, 2011 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110527045350/http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/cokeville.html |archive-date = May 27, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, two major heavily used cutoffs were established in Wyoming. The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff was established in 1844 and cut about {{convert|70|mi|km}} off the main route. It leaves the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of South Pass and heads almost due west crossing Big Sandy Creek and then about {{convert|45|mi|km}} of waterless, very dusty desert before reaching the Green River near the present town of [[La Barge, Wyoming|La Barge]]. Ferries here transferred them across the Green River. From there the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff trail had to cross a mountain range to connect with the main trail near [[Cokeville, Wyoming|Cokeville]] in the Bear River Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/sublettegreenwood.htm |title = Sublette&amp;ndash;Greenwood Cutoff Map |publisher = Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office |access-date = May 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Trail#The Lander Road|Lander Road]], formally the Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake Wagon Road, was established and built by U.S. government contractors in 1858–59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/details/additionalestima00unitrich |title = Additional estimate for Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake wagon road: letter from the acting Secretary of the Interior, transmitting a communication from Colonel Lander in regard to the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake wagon road |publisher = United States.

The traffic in later years is undocumented.

The Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the {{convert|8800|ft|m}} Thompson Pass in the [[Wyoming Range]]. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another {{convert|8200|ft|m|adj=on}} pass on the [[Salt River Range]] of mountains and then descending into [[Star Valley]]. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of the town of [[Smoot, Wyoming|Smoot]]. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming&amp;ndash;Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the [[Salt River (Wyoming)|Salt River]] (which drains into the Snake River) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River Valley (Star Valley) about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north the road turned almost due west near the present town of [[Auburn, Wyoming|Auburn]], and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho, it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest until it crossed the [[Caribou Mountains (Idaho)|Caribou Mountains]] and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake. The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternatively, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of Soda Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/landerroad.htm |title = Lander Road Cutoff Map |publisher = Wyoshpo.state.wy.us |access-date = May 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Emigrant Trails of Southern Idaho&quot;; Bureau of Land Management &amp; Idaho State Historical Society;1993; pp 117–125 ASIN: B000KE2KTU&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous landmarks are located along the trail in Wyoming including Independence Rock, [[Ayres Natural Bridge]] and [[Register Cliff]].

=== Utah ===
In 1847, Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by [[Lansford Hastings]] to the Donner Party in 1846 through the Wasatch Mountains into Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm |title = An Emigrant Train from the top of Big Mountain entering the valley of the Great Salt Lake |website = Utah Division of Parks and Recreation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211220440/http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm |archive-date = February 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After getting into Utah, they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities—including Salt Lake City. In 1848, the Salt Lake Cutoff was established by Sam Hensley,&lt;ref name=&quot;hensley&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/060594.html |title = It's Sam Hensley-Not Hansel-Who Discovered Cutoff |last = Schindler |first = Hal |date = June 5, 1994 |newspaper = The Salt Lake Tribune |pages = D1 |access-date = September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and returning members of the Mormon Battalion providing a path north of the [[Great Salt Lake]] from Salt Lake City back to the California and Oregon trails. This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the City of Rocks near the Utah&amp;ndash;Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon bound travelers. Located about half way on both the California and Oregon trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one &quot;detoured&quot; to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the [[Weber River|Weber]], Bear, and [[Malad River (Gooding County, Idaho)|Malad]] rivers, which were used mostly by travelers bound for Oregon or California.

The main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the Bear River Valley, which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by a then-impassable cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idahohistory.net/OTbighill.html Big Hill Idaho]. OCTA Idaho accessed February 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (Much later, [[U.S. Highway 30|US-30]], using modern explosives and equipment, was built through this cut). In 1852 Eliza Ann McAuley found and with help developed the McAuley Cutoff which bypassed much of the difficult climb and descent of Big Hill. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} on they passed present-day [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]], Idaho, which is now the site of the National Oregon-California Trail Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregontrailcenter.org/ The National Oregon-California Trail Center] Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The trail follows the Bear River northwest to present-day Soda Springs. The springs here were a favorite attraction of the pioneers who marveled at the hot carbonated water and chugging &quot;steamboat&quot; springs. Many stopped and did their laundry in the hot water as there was usually plenty of good grass and fresh water available.&lt;ref&gt;Soda Springs quotes Idaho State Historical Society [http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0182.pdf] Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for the Great Salt Lake, and the main trail turns northwest to follow the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] valley to Fort Hall, Idaho. Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the Snake River. It was established in 1832 by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth and company and later sold in 1837 to the Hudson's Bay Company. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests, and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about {{convert|210|mi|km}}, taking nine to twelve days.

At Soda Springs was one branch of [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Lander Road|Lander Road]] (established and built with government contractors in 1858), which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day Auburn, Wyoming, and entering Idaho. From there it proceeded northwest into Idaho up Stump Creek canyon for about {{convert|10|mi|km}}. One branch turned almost 90 degrees and proceeded southwest to Soda Springs. Another branch headed almost due west past Gray's Lake to rejoin the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of Fort Hall.

On the main trail about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of Soda Springs Hudspeth's Cutoff (established 1849 and used mostly by California trail users) took off from the main trail heading almost due west, bypassing Fort Hall. It rejoined the California Trail at Cassia Creek near the City of Rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Hudspeth cutoff map (OCTA-Idaho) [http://www.idahoocta.org/Idaho_Trail_Sites.html] Accessed February 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hudspeth's Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall, but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it helped spread out the traffic during peak periods, making more grass available.&lt;ref&gt;For an Oregon-California trail map up to the junction in Idaho NPS [http://www.nps.gov/PWR/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=oreg&amp;parkname=Oregon%20National%20Historic%20Trail Oregon National Historic Trail Map].

West of Fort Hall the main trail traveled about {{convert|40|mi|km}} on the south side of the Snake River southwest past American Falls, [[Massacre Rocks]], Register Rock, and Coldwater Hill near present-day [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], Idaho. Near the junction of the [[Raft River]] and Snake River the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest past present day [[Almo, Idaho|Almo]]. This trail then passed through the City of Rocks and over Granite Pass where it went southwest along Goose Creek, Little Goose Creek, and Rock Spring Creek. It went about {{convert|95|mi|km}} through [[Thousand Springs Scenic Byway|Thousand Springs Valley]], West Brush Creek, and Willow Creek, before arriving at the Humboldt River in northeastern Nevada near present-day [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elkorose.com/osino/catrailsmap_smaller.jpg Northern Nevada and Utah, Southern Idaho Tail Map] Accessed February 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The California Trail proceeded west down the Humboldt before reaching and crossing the Sierra Nevadas.

There were only a few places where the Snake River was not buried deep in a canyon, and few spots where the river slowed down enough to make a crossing possible. Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale's Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail. Some lost their wagons and teams over the falls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0752.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042929/http://history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0752.pdf|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trails on the north side joined the trail from [[Three Island Crossing]] about {{convert|17|mi|km}} west of Glenns Ferry on the north side of the Snake River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/id/publications.Par.50091.File.dat/OCTAbooklet.pdf Oregon Trail North Side Alternate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325011951/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/id/publications.Par.50091.File.dat/OCTAbooklet.pdf|date=March 25, 2009}}, Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/ciro/hrs/images/fig7.jpg map of North Side Alternate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325012003/http://www.nps.gov/archive/ciro/hrs/images/fig7.jpg |date=March 25, 2009 }}, Retrieved February 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goodale's Cutoff]], established in 1862 on the north side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Native Americans and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the {{convert|230|mi|km|adj=on}} cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the [[Big Lost River|Lost River]] part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of [[Arco, Idaho]], and wound through the northern part of what is now [[Craters of the Moon National Monument]]. From there it went southwest to [[Camas Prairie]] and ended at [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834-54)|Old Fort Boise]] on the [[Boise River]]. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along [[U.S. Highway 20|US-20]], [[U.S. Highway 26|US-26]], and [[U.S. Highway 93|US-93]] between Craters of the Moon National Monument and [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodale's Cutoff NPS [http://www.nps.gov/archive/crmo/goodale.htm] Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From the present site of Pocatello, the trail proceeded almost due west on the south side of the Snake River for about {{convert|180|mi|km}}. This route passed [[Cauldron Linn (Idaho)|Cauldron Linn]] rapids, [[Shoshone Falls]], two falls near the present city of [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], and Upper Salmon Falls on the Snake River. At Salmon Falls there were often a hundred or more Native Americans fishing who would trade for their salmon, a welcome treat.

The trail continued west to Three Island Crossing (near present-day [[Glenns Ferry, Idaho|Glenns Ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativeamerican.co.uk/oregonroute15.html Three Island Crossing photos] Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Three Island Crossing quotes {{cite web |url = http://www.wvi.com/users/TIC/tic.htm |title = Archived copy |access-date = February 23, 2009 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206235002/http://www.wvi.com/users/TIC/tic.htm |archive-date = February 6, 2009 |df = mdy-all }} Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) Here most emigrants used the divisions of the river caused by three islands to cross the difficult and swift Snake River by ferry or by driving or sometimes floating their wagons and swimming their teams across. The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or entangle the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateparks.com/three_island_crossing.html Three Mile Island Crossing Park], Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about {{convert|130|mi|km}} long. The usually lush Boise River Valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Native American boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river—they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. In present-day Idaho, [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] roughly follows the Oregon Trail from the Idaho-Oregon State border at the Snake River. Approximately {{convert|7|mi|spell=in}} east of [[Declo, Idaho|Declo]] in  present-day rural [[Cassia County, Idaho|Cassia County]], [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] meets the western terminus of the western section of [[Interstate 86 (west)|I-86]]. I-86 heads east, then northeast to [[American Falls, Idaho|American Falls]] and [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] following the Oregon Trail, while [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] heads southeast to the State border with [[Utah]]. [[US Highway 30|US-30]] roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from [[Pocatello]] to [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]]

Starting in about 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day [[Ontario, Oregon]]. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water. Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf National Trail Map] Retrieved February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day Idaho, the state highway ID-78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.

In 1869, the Central Pacific established [[Kelton, Utah]] as a railhead and the terminus of the western mail was moved from Salt Lake City.

[[File:OregonTrailBakerCityOR.jpg|thumb|right|Present-day footpaths following ruts of the Oregon Trail near the [[National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center]] east of [[Baker City, Oregon]]]]

Once across the Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise the weary travelers traveled across what would become the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the [[Malheur River]] and then past [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]] on the Snake River, up the [[Burnt River (Oregon)|Burnt River]] canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]] before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the [[Whitman Mission]] near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the [[Whitman massacre|Whitmans were killed by Native Americans]]. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present-day [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], Oregon, crossing the [[Umatilla River]], John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.

Arriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the [[Cascade Mountains]] and Mount Hood, some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the Columbia River. Once they transited the Cascade's [[Columbia River Gorge]] with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the {{convert|1.6|mi|km|adj=on}} portage around the [[Cascade Rapids]] before coming out near the [[Willamette River]] where Oregon City was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough Lolo Pass.

Several Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved through the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.

In Central Oregon, there was the [[Santiam Wagon Road]] (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The [[Applegate Trail]] (established 1846), cutting off the California Trail from the Humboldt River in Nevada, crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. [[U.S. Route 99]] and [[Interstate 5]] through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.

== Travel equipment ==
=== Wagons and pack animals===
Three types of [[Working animal|draft]] and [[pack animal]]s were used by Oregon Trail pioneers: [[oxen]], [[mule]]s, and [[horse]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;&gt;David Dary, ''The Oregon Trail: An American Saga'' (Knopt, 2004), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1842, many emigrants favored oxen&amp;mdash;castrated bulls (males) of the genus ''[[Bos]]'' (cattle), generally over four years old&amp;mdash;as the best animal to pull wagons, because they were docile, generally healthy, and able to continue moving in difficult conditions such as mud and snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Oxen could also survive on [[Tallgrass prairie|prairie grasses]] and [[Artemisia tridentata|sage]], unlike horses, who had to be fed. Moreover, oxen were less expensive to purchase and maintain than horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Oxen also could stand idle for long periods without suffering damage to the feet and legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Oxen were trained by leading, the use of a [[whip]] or [[goad]], and the use of oral commands (such as &quot;[[Gee and haw|Gee]]&quot; (right), &quot;[[Gee and haw|Haw]]&quot; (left), and &quot;Whoa&quot; (stop)).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Two oxen were typically yoked together at the neck or head; the left ox was referred to as the &quot;near&quot; or &quot;nigh&quot; ox, and the right ox as the &quot;off&quot; ox.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; While no [[rein]]s, [[Bit (horse)|bits]], or [[halter]]s were needed, the trainer had to be forceful. Oxen typically traveled at a steady pace up to two miles an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt;

One drawback of oxen was the difficulty of shoeing. Oxen hooves are [[Cloven hoof|cloven]] (split), and they had to be shod with two curved pieces of metal, one on each side of the hoof. While horses and mules allowed themselves to be shod relatively easily, the process was more difficult with oxen, which would lie down and tuck their feet under themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt;  As a result, several men had to lift and hold an ox while he was being shod.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt;

Mules were used by some emigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; The competing merits of oxen and mules were hotly debated among emigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stamm&quot;&gt;Mike Stamm, ''The Mule Alternative: The Saddle Mule in the American West'' (1992), p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Some found oxen to be more durable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Others, by contrast, believed that mules were more durable, and mules may have had a lower attrition rate on the trail than oxen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stamm&quot;/&gt; Like oxen, mules could survive on prairie grasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Mules were, however, notoriously ill-tempered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dary&quot;/&gt; Mules also cost about three times as much as oxen, a deciding factor for many emigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stamm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George R. Stewart, ''The California Trail: An Epic with Many Heroes'' (1962), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three types of wagons were pulled:

* [[Conestoga wagon]]s, a heavy type of covered wagon 
* [[Covered wagon]] (&quot;prairie schooners&quot;), lighter than a Conestoga and often just a covered farm wagon.
* Studebaker (see [[Studebaker#History|§ History]])

=== Food ===
The typical cost of food for four people for six months was about $150.{{when|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Dary, David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

Food and water were key concerns for migrants. Wagons typically carried at least one large water keg,&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = McLynn, Frank |title = Wagons West: The Epic Story of America's Overland Trails |publisher = Random House |date = 2002 |pages = 103–04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;&gt;Reginald Horsman, ''Feast or Famine: Food and Drink in American Westward Expansion'' (University of Missouri Press, 2008), pp. 128–131.&lt;/ref&gt; and guidebooks available from the 1840s and later gave similar advice to migrants on what food to take. T. H. Jefferson, in his ''Brief Practice Advice'' guidebook for migrants, recommended that each adult take 200 pounds of flour: &quot;Take plenty of bread stuff; this is the staff of life when everything else runs short.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt;

Food often took the form of [[cracker (food)|crackers]] or [[hardtack]]; Southerners sometimes chose [[cornmeal]] or [[pinole]] rather than [[wheat]] flour.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;  Emigrants typically ate [[rice]] and [[bean]]s only at forts stopped at along the way, because boiling water was difficult on the trail, and fuel was not abundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; [[Lansford Hastings]] recommended that each emigrant take 200 pounds of [[flour]], 150 pounds of &quot;[[bacon]]&quot; (a word which, at the time, referred broadly to all forms of [[salt pork]]), 20 pounds of [[sugar]], and 10 pounds of [[salt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; [[Chipped beef]], rice, tea, dried beans, [[dried fruit]], [[saleratus]] (for raising bread), [[vinegar]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[tallow]] might also be taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt;  Joseph Ware's 1849 guide recommends that travelers take for each individual a barrel of flour or 180 pounds of ship's biscuit (i.e., hardtack), 150–180 pounds of bacon, 60 pounds of beans or [[pea]]s, 25 pounds of [[rice]], 25 pounds of [[coffee]], 40 pounds of sugar, a keg of lard, 30 or 40 pounds of [[dried fruit]] ([[peach]]es or [[apple]]s), a keg of clear, [[Rendering (animal products)|rendered]] beef [[suet]] (to substitute for butter), as well as some [[vinegar]], salt, and [[Black pepper|pepper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; Many emigrant families also carried a small amount of [[tea]] and [[maple sugar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;

[[Randolph B. Marcy]], an Army officer who wrote an 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended. He advised emigrants to drive cattle instead as a source of fresh beef.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; Marcy also instructed emigrants to store sides of bacon in canvas bags or in boxes surrounded by [[bran]] to protect against extreme heat, which could make bacon [[Rancidification|go rancid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; Marcy instructed emigrants to put salt pork on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; Marcy also recommended the use of [[pemmican]], as well as the storage of sugar in [[India-rubber]] or [[gutta-percha]] sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt;

[[Canning]] technology had just begun to be developed, and it gained in popularity through the period of westward expansion. Initially, only upper-class migrants typically used canned goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; There are references in sources to canned cheese, fruit, meat, [[oyster]]s, and [[sardine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon. Rather than canned vegetables, Marcy suggested that travelers take dried vegetables, which had been used in the [[Crimean War]] and by the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt;

Some pioneers took eggs and butter packed in barrels of flour, and some took [[dairy cow]]s along the trail.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; [[Hunting]] provided another source of food along the trail; pioneers hunted [[American bison]] as well as [[pronghorn antelope]], [[Odocoileus|deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], and wildfowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; From rivers and lakes, emigrants also fished for [[catfish]] and [[trout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; When emigrants faced starvation, they would sometimes slaughter their animals (horses, mules, and oxen).&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;  In desperate times, migrants would search for less-popular sources of food, including [[coyote]], [[fox]], [[jackrabbit]], [[marmot]], [[prairie dog]], and [[rattlesnake]] (nicknamed &quot;bush fish&quot; in the later period).&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;

At the time, [[scurvy]] was well-recognized, but there was a lack of clear understanding of how to prevent the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, pioneers' consumption of the wild [[berry|berries]] (including [[chokeberry]], [[gooseberry]], and [[serviceberry]]) and [[Ribes|currants]] that grew along the trail (particularly along the [[Platte River]]) helped make scurvy infrequent.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt; Marcy's guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, [[citric acid]] could be drunk with sugar and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horsman&quot;/&gt;

Emigrant families, who were mostly middle-class, prided themselves on preparing a good table. Although operating [[Dutch oven]]s and kneading dough was difficult on the trail, many baked good bread and even pies.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;

For fuel to heat food, travelers would collect [[cedar wood]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], or [[willow]] wood, when available, and sometimes dry prairie grass.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; More frequently, however, travelers relied on &quot;[[cow dung|buffalo chips]]&quot;—dried bison dung—to fuel fires.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; Buffalo chips resembled rotten wood and would make clear and hot fires.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; Chips burned quickly, however, and it took up to three [[bushel]]s of chips to heat a single meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;  Collecting buffalo chips was a common task for children and was one chore that even very young children could carry out.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt; As a result, &quot;memoirs written by those who were very young when they made the journey west invariably refer to this aspect of life on the trail.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLynn&quot;/&gt;

=== Clothing, equipment and supplies ===
Tobacco was popular, both for personal use, and for trading with natives and other pioneers. Each person brought at least two changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred once or twice a month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel.

Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. Storage boxes were ideally the same height, so they could be arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for a sleeping platform.

The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.

Travelers brought books, Bibles, trail guides, and writing quills, ink, and paper for writing letters or journalling (about one in 200 kept a diary).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 4–5|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A belt and folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, and thread for mending were required. Spare leather was used for repairing shoes, harnesses, and other equipment. Some used goggles to keep dust out of the eyes.

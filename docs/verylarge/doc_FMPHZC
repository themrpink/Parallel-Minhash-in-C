===Peninsula===
That spring, Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]]  [[George B. McClellan]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], launched the [[Peninsula Campaign]] intending to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=100}} In his memoirs, Longstreet would write that while in temporary command of the Confederate army he wrote to [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson]] proposing that he march to Jackson in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and combine forces. No evidence has emerged for this claim.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=65}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=100-101}}

Following the delay of the Union offensive against Richmond at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1862)|Siege of Yorktown]], Johnston oversaw a tactical withdrawal to the outskirts of Richmond, where defenses had already been prepared. Longstreet's division formed the rearguard, which was heavily engaged at the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] on May 5. There, Union troops beginning with [[Joseph Hooker]]'s division of the Union [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]], which was commanded by [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]], came out of a forest into open ground to attack Longstreet's men.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=267}} To protect the army's supply wagons, Longstreet launched a strong counterattack with the brigades of [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]], [[A. P. Hill]], Pickett and two other regiments. The assault drove the Union soldiers back.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=104-105}} Finding the ground he occupied untenable, Longstreet requested reinforcements from D.H. Hill's division a little further up the road and received Early's brigade, to which was later added the entire division.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=74}} Early then launched a fruitless and bloody attack well after the wagons had already been safely evacuated. Overall, the battle was a success, protecting the passage of Confederate supply wagons and delaying the advance of McClellan's army toward Richmond.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=106-107}} The affair resulted in the capture of nine Union artillery pieces.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=267}} Longstreet reported 9,000 Confederate troops engaged compared to 12,000 Union troops, and the Confederates suffered fewer casualties.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=79}} McClellan inaccurately characterized the battle as a Union victory in a dispatch to Washington.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=267}}

On May 31, during the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], Longstreet received his orders verbally from Johnston, but ended up apparently misremembering them. He marched his men in the wrong direction down the wrong road, causing congestion and confusion with other Confederate units, diluting the effect of the massive Confederate counterattack against McClellan. He then got into an argument with Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Huger (general)|Benjamin Huger]] over who had seniority, causing significant delay.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=19}} When D.H. Hill subsequently asked Longstreet for reinforcements, he complied, but failed to properly coordinate his brigades.{{snf|Wert|1993|p=124}} Late in the day, General [[Edwin Vose Sumner]] crossed the rain-swollen [[Chickahominy River]] with two divisions.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=121}} General Johnston was wounded during the battle. Although Johnston preferred Longstreet as his replacement, command of the Army of Northern Virginia shifted to [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|G. W. Smith]], the senior major general, for a single day.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=19-20}} On June 1, Richardson's division of Sumner's corps engaged Longstreet's men, routing [[Lewis Armistead]]'s brigade, but the brigades of Pickett, [[William Mahone]], and [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]] positioned in the woods managed to hold it back. After six hours of fighting, the battle ended in a draw.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=122-123}} Johnston praised Longstreet's performance in the battle. Biographer William Garrett Piston marks it as &quot;the lowest point in Longstreet's military career&quot;.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=19}} Longstreet's report unfairly blamed Huger for the mishaps.{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1214}} On June 1, the President's military advisor [[Robert E. Lee]] assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. In his memoirs, Longstreet suggested that he initially doubted Lee's capacity for command.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that his arrival &quot;was far from reconciling the troops to the loss of our beloved chief, Joseph E. Johnston&quot;. He wrote that Lee did not have much of a reputation at the time that he took command and that there were therefore &quot;misgivings&quot; about Lee's &quot;power and skill for field service&quot;.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=112}}

In late June, Lee organized a plan to drive McClellan's army away from the capital, which culminated in what became known as the [[Seven Days Battles]]. At daybreak on June 27 at [[Battle of Gaines's Mill|Gaines's Mill]], the Confederate Army attacked the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] of the Union Army under Brigadier General [[Fitz John Porter]], which was positioned north of the Chickahominy River on McClellan's right flank. Federal troops held their lines for most of the day against attacks from the divisions of A.P. Hill and D.H. Hill, and Jackson did not arrive until afternoon. At about 5 P.M., Longstreet received orders from Lee to join the battle. Longstreet's fresh brigades under Pickett and [[Richard H. Anderson]], accompanied by the brigades of Brigadier General [[John Bell Hood]] and Colonel [[Evander M. Law]] from [[William H.C. Whiting]]'s division, charged the Union lines, forcing them to retreat across the Chickahominy.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=125-129}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=138}} Longstreet was engaged again on June 30 with about 20,000 men at [[Battle of Glendale|Glendale]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=141-144}} He departed from his usual strategy of placing troops several lines deep and instead spread them out, which in the opinion of some military historians cost him the battle. His efforts were further damaged by the slowness of other Confederate commanders, and McClellan was able to withdraw his army to the high plateau of [[Malvern Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanger pp. 72-74&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson, engaged at [[Battle of White Oak Swamp|White Oak Swamp]], ignored reports of ways in which to cross the swamp, and refused to answer an inquiry from Longstreet's staff officer John Fairfax. Huger's advance was slow enough to allow Federal troops to be transported away from guarding him and towards Longstreet, and [[Theophilus Holmes]] also performed poorly. Nearly 50,000 Confederate troops stood within a few miles of the field at Glendale and rendered little to no assistance.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=144-145}} In a reconnaissance on the evening of June 30, Longstreet reported to Lee that conditions were favorable enough to justify assault. In the [[Battle of Malvern Hill|fighting]] the next day, Longstreet surrendered A.P. Hill's entire division to Magruder, and marched his remaining troops toward the Union positions on the Confederate extreme right. His men were exposed to fire on their flanks from McClellan's troops and were forced to withdraw without success.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Longstreet had operational command of nearly half of Lee's army&amp;mdash;15 brigades&amp;mdash;as it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and quite well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines's Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from poor maps, organizational flaws, and weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, and was unable to destroy the Union Army.{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=204}}{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1214}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=134-151}} Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: &quot;He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the world seemed flying to pieces.&quot; General Lee said shortly after Seven Days, &quot;Longstreet was the staff in my right hand.&quot; He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=151-152}} Lee reorganized the Army of Northern Virginia after Seven Days, increasing Longstreet's command from six brigades to 28.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=151}} Longstreet took command of the Right Wing (later to become known as the First Corps) and Jackson was given command of the Left Wing.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=164}} Over time, Lee and Longstreet became good friends, and set up headquarters very near each other. Despite sharing with Jackson a belief in [[Temperance movement|temperance]] as well as a deep religious conviction, Lee never developed as strong a friendship with him. Piston speculates that the more relaxed atmosphere of Longstreet's headquarters, which included gambling and drinking, allowed Lee to relax and take his  mind off the war, and reminded him of his more happy younger days.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=22-23}}

After the campaign, an editorial appeared in the ''Richmond Examiner'' inaccurately claiming that the Battle of Glendale &quot;was fought exclusively by General A.P. Hill and the forces under his command&quot;. Longstreet then drafted a letter refuting the article, which was published in the ''Richmond Whig.'' Hill took offense and requested that his division be transferred out of Longstreet's command. Longstreet agreed, but Lee took no action. Then, Hill refused to accede to Longstreet's repeated requests for information, and was eventually arrested on Longstreet's orders. He challenged Longstreet to a duel, who accepted, but Lee intervened and transferred Hill's division out of Longstreet's command and into Jackson's.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=153-155}}

===Second Bull Run===
The military reputations of Lee's corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee's army, with Longstreet more typically advocating and executing strong defensive strategies and tactics. Jackson has been described as the army's hammer, Longstreet its anvil.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=206}} In the first part of the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] of August 1862, this stereotype held true, but in the climactic battle, it did not. In June, the Federal Government created the 50,000-strong [[Army of Virginia]], and put Major Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] in command.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=156}} Pope moved south in an attempt to attack Lee and threaten Richmond through an overland march. Lee left Longstreet near Richmond to guard the city and dispatched Jackson to hinder Pope's advance. Jackson won a major victory at the [[Battle of Cedar Mountain]].{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=23}} After learning that McClellan, as ordered, had dispatched troops north to assist Pope, Lee ordered Longstreet north as well, leaving only three divisions under G.W. Smith to protect Richmond against McClellan's reduced force. Longstreet's men began their march on August 17, aided by Stuart's cavalry.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=157-168}} On August 23, Longstreet engaged Pope's position in a minor artillery duel at the [[First Battle of Rappahannock Station]]. The Confederate [[141st Field Artillery Regiment|Washington Artillery]] was heavily damaged and a Union shell landed feet away from Longstreet and Wilcox but failed to explode. Meanwhile, Stuart's cavalry rode around the Army of Virginia and captured hundreds of soldiers and horses as well as some of Pope's personal belongings.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=161}}

Jackson executed a sweeping flanking maneuver that captured Pope's main supply depot. He placed his corps in the rear of Pope's army, but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28 and August 29, the start of the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] (Second Manassas), Pope pounded Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched from the west, through Thoroughfare Gap, to reach the battlefield. On the afternoon of the 28th, Longstreet engaged a 5,000-man federal division under [[James B. Ricketts]] at the [[Battle of Thoroughfare Gap]]. Ricketts had been ordered to delay Longstreet's march towards the main Confederate army, but he took up his position too late, allowing [[George T. Anderson]]'s brigade to occupy the high ground. Lee and Longstreet watched the battle together and decided to flank the Union position. Hood's division and a brigade under [[Henry L. Benning]] advanced towards the gap from the north and the south, respectively, while Wilcox's division followed in a six-mile march northward. Ricketts realized his position was untenable and withdrew that evening, allowing Longstreet to join up with the rest of Lee's army. Postwar criticism of Longstreet claimed that he marched his men too slowly, leaving Jackson to bear the brunt of the fighting for two days, but they covered roughly {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} in a little over 24 hours and Lee did not attempt to get his army concentrated any faster.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=164-166}}

[[File:James Longstreet crop.png|thumb|upright|left|Longstreet circa 1862]]
When Longstreet's men arrived at Second Manassas, around midday on August 29, Lee planned a flanking attack on the Union Army, which was concentrating its attention on Jackson. Longstreet demurred against three suggestions from Lee, urging him to attack, recommending instead that a reconnaissance in force be conducted to survey the ground in front of him. This was done and confirmed the presence of Porter's V Corps in front of his lines. By 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Hood's division moved forward against Porter's corps and drove back the soldiers they encountered, but had to be withdrawn at night when it advanced too far ahead of the main lines. Despite the smashing victory that followed, Longstreet's performance at the battle was criticized by postbellum advocates of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]], claiming that his slowness, reluctance to attack, and disobedience to General Lee were a harbinger of his controversial performance to come on July 2, 1863, at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=205}}{{sfn|Gallagher|1998|pp=140-157}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=166-172}} Lee's biographer, [[Douglas Southall Freeman]], wrote: &quot;The seeds of much of the disaster at Gettysburg were sown in that instant&amp;mdash;when Lee yielded to Longstreet and Longstreet discovered that he would.&quot;{{sfn|Freeman|1936|p=325}} Longstreet biographer [[Jeffry D. Wert]] disputes this conclusion, pointing out that in a post-war letter to Longstreet, Porter told him that had he attacked him that day, his &quot;loss would have been enormous&quot;.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=172}}

Despite this criticism, the following day, August 30, was one of Longstreet's finest performances of the war. After his attacks on the 29th, Pope came to believe with little evidence that Jackson was in retreat.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=176}} He ordered a reluctant Porter to move his corps forward in pursuit, and they collided with Jackson's men and suffered heavy casualties. The attack exposed the Union left flank, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union flank with over 25,000 men. For over four hours they &quot;pounded like a giant hammer&quot;{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=177-178}} with Longstreet actively directing artillery fire and sending brigades into the fray. Longstreet and Lee were together during the assault and both of them came under Union artillery fire. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope's army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground.{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1214}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=180-198}} Longstreet gave all of the credit for the victory to Lee, describing the campaign as &quot;clever and brilliant&quot;. It established a strategic model he believed to be ideal&amp;mdash;the use of defensive tactics within a strategic offensive.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=179}} On September 1, Jackson's corps moved to cut off the Union retreat at the [[Battle of Chantilly]]. Longstreet's men remained on the field in order to fool Pope into thinking that Lee's entire army was still on his front.{{sfn|Hennessy|1993|pp=441-442}}

===Antietam and Fredericksburg===
Longstreet's actions in the final two major Confederate defensive battles of 1862 would be the proving grounds for his development of dominant defensive tactics.{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|p=35}} After the Confederate success at Second Manassas, Lee, holding the strategic initiative, decided to take the war to Maryland to relieve Virginia and hopefully induce foreign nations to come to the Confederates' aid. Longstreet supported the plan. &quot;The situation called for action&quot;, he later said, &quot;and there was but one opening – across the Potomac.&quot; His men crossed into Maryland on September 6 and arrived in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] the following day.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=180-181}} In the [[Maryland Campaign]] of September, at the [[Battle of Antietam]], Longstreet held his part of the Confederate defensive line against Union forces twice as numerous. After the delaying action Longstreet's corps fought at [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]], he retired to [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]] to join Stonewall Jackson, and prepared to fight a defensive battle. Using terrain to his advantage, Longstreet validated his idea that the tactical defense was now vastly superior to the exposed offense. While the offense dominated in the time of [[Napoleon]], the technological advancements had overturned this. Lt. Col. Harold M. Knudsen claims that Longstreet was one of the few Civil War officers sensible of this development.{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=35-42}} At the end of that bloodiest day of the Civil War, Lee greeted his subordinate by saying, &quot;Ah! Here is Longstreet; here's my old ''war-horse!''&quot;{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=200}} On October 9, a few weeks after Antietam, Longstreet was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]]. Lee arranged for Longstreet's promotion to be dated one day earlier than Jackson's, making the Old War-Horse the senior lieutenant general in the entire Confederate Army. In an army reorganization in November, Longstreet's command, now designated the [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]], consisted of five divisions, approximately 41,000 men.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=279-278}}{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1215}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=205, 208}}

[[File:Fredericksburg-Overview.png|thumb|A map of the Battle of Fredericksburg]]
In December, Longstreet's First Corps played the decisive role in the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], midway between the two opposing capitals, where the Confederate army made its stand to protect Richmond from the Army of the Potomac, now commanded by [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet to take the time to dig in portions of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a [[kill zone]] over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not build defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, [[abatis]], and fieldworks to be constructed south of the town along a stonewall at the foot of Marye's Heights, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. This was completed in the days before the battle. After failing to cross the [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] on December 11, Burnside ordered an artillery bombardment of the town, and forced his way across the following day.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=215-218}}

Longstreet had his men firmly entrenched along Marye's Heights. On December 13, under Burnside's orders, troops from the Union Right Grand Division under Sumner launched fourteen frontal assaults against Longstreet's troops, who unexpectedly found themselves at the center of the battle.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=218-221}} When Lee expressed apprehension that the Federal troops might overrun Longstreet's men, Longstreet replied that as long as he had sufficient ammunition he would &quot;kill them all&quot; before any of them reached his line. He advised him to look towards Jackson's more tenuous position to the right. Longstreet was proven correct, for from their strong position, Longstreet's men easily held off all of the Union assaults, while Jackson managed with greater difficulty to repel a much stronger Union attack led by the division of [[George Meade]]. One Union general compared the scene before Marye's Heights to &quot;a great slaughter pen&quot; and said that his men &quot;might as well have tried to take Hell&quot;.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=221}}

Burnside intended to attack again the next day, but several of his officers, particularly Sumner, advised him against it. He entrenched his men instead and withdrew on December 15.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=222-223}} The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights; Longstreet lost only 1,900. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=297-321}}{{sfn|Alexander|1989|pp=166-187}}

===Suffolk===
In October 1862, Longstreet had suggested to Joe Johnston that he be sent to fight in the war's [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=206}} Shortly after Fredericksburg, Longstreet vaguely suggested to Lee that &quot;one corps could hold the Rappahannock while the other was operating elsewhere&quot;. In February 1863, he made a more specific request, suggesting to Wigfall that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the [[Army of Tennessee]], where Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]] was being challenged in [[Middle Tennessee]] by the [[Army of the Cumberland]] under Union Maj. Gen. [[William S. Rosecrans]], Longstreet's roommate at West Point.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=227-228}} By this time, Longstreet could be identified as part of a &quot;western concentration bloc&quot; which believed that reinforcing Confederate armies operating in the Western Theater to protect the states in that part of the Confederacy from invasion was more important than offensive campaigns in the East. This group also included Johnston and Louis Wigfall, now a Confederate senator, both of whom Longstreet was very close with. These people were generally cautious and believed that the Confederacy, with its limited resources, should engage in a defensive rather than an offensive war.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=41-42}} Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps, but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. Seaborne movements of the Union [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] potentially threatened vital ports on the mid-Atlantic coast. Pickett's division started for the capital in mid-February, was followed by Hood's, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=228}}{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}} The divisions of McLaws and Anderson remained with Lee.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=373}}

In April, Longstreet [[Siege of Suffolk|besieged Union forces]] in the city of [[Suffolk, Virginia]], a minor operation, but one that was very important to Lee's army, still stationed in war-devastated central Virginia. It enabled Confederate authorities to collect huge amounts of provisions that had been under Union control. However, this operation caused Longstreet and 15,000 men of the First Corps to be absent from the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May. Despite Lee's brilliant victory at Chancellorsville, Longstreet once again came under criticism, claiming that he could have marched his men back from Suffolk in time to join Lee.{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=205}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=234-241}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=322-333}}{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=190}} However, from the Chancellorsville and Suffolk scenario, Longstreet brought forward the beginnings of a new Confederate strategy. These events proved that the Army of Northern Virginia could manage with fewer troops for periods of time, and units could be shifted to create windows of opportunity in other theaters. Longstreet advocated the first strategic movements to utilize rail, interior lines, and create temporary numerical advantages in Mississippi or Tennessee prior to Gettysburg.{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=62-65}}

===Gettysburg===

====Campaign plans====
Following Chancellorsville and the death of Stonewall Jackson, Longstreet and Lee met in mid-May to discuss options for the army's summer campaign. Longstreet once more pushed for the detachment of all or part of his corps to be sent to [[Tennessee]]. The justification for this course of action was becoming more urgent as Union Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was [[Vicksburg Campaign|advancing]] on the critical Confederate stronghold on the [[Mississippi River]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. Longstreet argued that a reinforced army under Bragg could defeat Rosecrans and drive toward the [[Ohio River]], which would compel Grant to break his hold on Vicksburg.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=242-246}} He advanced these views during a meeting with Confederate [[Confederate States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[James Seddon]], who approved of the idea but doubted that Lee would do so, and opined that Davis would be unlikely to go against Lee's wishes. Longstreet had criticized Bragg's generalship and may have been hoping to replace him, although he also might have wished to see Joseph Johnston take command, and indicated that he would be content to serve under him as a corps commander. Lee prevented this plan from taking place by telling Davis that parting with large numbers of troops would force him to move his army closer to Richmond, and instead advancing a plan to invade [[Pennsylvania]]. A campaign in the North would relieve agricultural and military pressure that the war was placing on Virginia and North Carolina, and, by threatening a federal city, disrupt Union offensives elsewhere and erode support for the war among Northern civilians.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=44}} In his memoirs, Longstreet described his reaction to Lee's proposal:

{{Quote|His plan or wishes announced, it became useless and improper to offer suggestions leading to a different course. All that I could ask was that the policy of the campaign should be one of defensive tactics; that we should work so as to force the enemy to attack us, in such good position as we might find in our own country, so well adapted to that purpose&amp;mdash;which might assure us of a grand triumph. To this he readily assented as an important and material adjunct to his general plan.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=331}}}}

There is conflicting evidence for the veracity of Longstreet's account. It was written years after the campaign and is affected by hindsight, both of the results of the battle and of the postbellum criticism of the Lost Cause authors. In letters of the time Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain with Lee. In April 1868, Lee said that he &quot;had never made any such promise, and had never thought of doing any such thing&quot;.{{sfn|Coddington|1968|p=11}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=246}} Yet in his post-battle report, Lee wrote, &quot;It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Gettysburg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://facweb.furman.edu/~benson/docs/lee.htm |title=Lee's Report of the Gettysburg Campaign |last=Lee |first=Robert E. |date=January 1864 |publisher=Furman University |access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army of Northern Virginia was reorganized after Jackson's death. Two division commanders, [[Richard S. Ewell]] and [[A. P. Hill]], were promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the Second and the newly created Third Corps respectively. Longstreet's First Corps gave up the division of Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]] during the reorganization, leaving him with the divisions of Hood, McLaws, and Pickett.{{sfn|Coddington|1968|p=12}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=248}}

After it was determined that an advance north was inevitable, Longstreet dispatched the scout [[Henry Thomas Harrison]], whom he had met during the Suffolk Campaign, to gather information. He paid Harrison in gold and told him that he &quot;did not care to see him till he could bring information of importance&quot;.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=333}} In the initial movements of the campaign, Longstreet's corps followed Ewell's through the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. Harrison reported to Longstreet on the evening of June 28, and was instrumental in warning the Confederates that the Army of the Potomac was advancing north to meet them more quickly than they had anticipated, and were already massing around [[Frederick, Maryland]]. Lee was initially skeptical, but the report prompted him to order the immediate concentration of his army north of Frederick near [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]. Harrison also brought news that [[Joseph Hooker]] had been replaced as commander of the Army of the Potomac by [[George Meade]].{{sfn|Coddington|1968|pp=188-190}}

====July 1–2====
[[File:Gettysburg Battle Map Day2.png|thumb|Gettysburg, July 2]]
Longstreet's actions at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] would become the centerpiece of the controversy that surrounded him for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, Stephen W. &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/1/2005_1_46.shtml General Longstreet and the American Cause] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120004214/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/1/2005_1_46.shtml |date=2008-11-20 }}&quot; ''American Heritage'', Feb/March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Longstreet arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of the first day, July 1, 1863, hours ahead of his troops. By then, two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill back through the town into defensive positions on [[Cemetery Hill]]. Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated, but chance and questionable decisions by A.P. Hill brought on the battle, which—on the first day—was an impressive Confederate victory. Meeting with Lee, Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position on elevated ground and advocated a strategic movement around the left flank of the enemy, to &quot;secure good ground between him and his capital&quot;, which would presumably compel Meade to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=346-361}}{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=206}}{{sfn|Coddington|1968|pp=360-361}} Instead, Lee exclaimed, &quot;If the enemy is there tomorrow, I will attack him.&quot; Longstreet replied, &quot;If he is there tomorrow it is because he wants you to attack.&quot;{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=358}}

Lee's plan for July 2 called for Longstreet to attack the Union's left flank, which would be followed up by Hill's attack on [[Cemetery Ridge]] near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet was not ready to attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]]'s brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and some distance from the attack positions they would need to reach.{{sfn|Fuller|1957|p=198}} All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.{{sfn|Coddington|1968|pp=378-379}}

Postbellum criticism of Longstreet claims that he was ordered by Lee to attack in the early morning and that his delays were a significant contributor to the loss of the battle.{{sfn|Dickson|2000|p=1215}} However, Lee agreed to the delays for arriving troops and did not issue his formal order for the attack until 11 a.m. Many historians agree that Longstreet did not aggressively pursue Lee's orders to launch an attack as early as possible. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert criticized Longsteet's performance and wrote that he &quot;allowed his disagreement with Lee's decision to affect his conduct.&quot;{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=268}} Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote, &quot;Unenthusiastic about the attack, Longstreet consumed so much time in properly assembling and aligning the corps that the assault did not commence until 4 p.m. During all the time that passed, Meade continued to move in troops to bring about a more and more complete concentration; by 6 p.m. he had achieved numerical superiority and had his left well covered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hattaway and Jones, pp. 406-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign historian Edwin Coddington presents the approach to the federal positions as &quot;a comedy of errors such as one might expect of inexperienced commanders and raw militia, but not of Lee's 'War Horse' and his veteran troops&quot;.{{sfn|Coddington|1968|pp=378-380}} An alternative view was expressed by John Lott, who argued that it would have been impossible to begin the attack much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ambiguous|date=July 2020}}

Regardless of the controversy regarding the preparations, however, once the assault began around 4 p.m., Longstreet pressed the assault by McLaws and Hood (Pickett's division had not yet arrived) competently against fierce Union resistance, but it was largely unsuccessful, with significant casualties.{{sfn|Tagg|1998|pp=206-207}}

====July 3====
On the night of July 2, Longstreet did not follow his usual custom of meeting Gen. Lee at his headquarters to discuss the day's battle, claiming that he was too fatigued to make the ride. Instead, he spent part of the night planning for a movement around [[Big Round Top]] that would allow him to attack the enemy's flank and rear. (Longstreet, despite his use of scouting parties, was apparently unaware that a considerable body of troops from the Union [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] was in position to block this move.) Shortly after issuing orders for the attack, around sunrise, Longstreet was joined at his headquarters by Lee, who was dismayed at this turn of events. The commanding general had intended for Longstreet to attack the Union left early in the morning in a manner similar to the attack of July 2, using Pickett's newly arrived division, in concert with a resumed attack by Ewell on Culp's Hill. What Lee found was that no one had ordered Pickett's division forward from its bivouac in the rear and that Longstreet had been planning an independent operation without consulting with him.{{sfn|Coddington|1968|pp=455-458}} Lee wrote with some restraint in his after-battle report that Longstreet's &quot;dispositions were not completed as early as was expected&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Gettysburg&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Pickett's-Charge.png|thumb|Pickett's Charge, July 3]]
Since his plans for an early-morning coordinated attack were now infeasible, Lee instead ordered Longstreet to coordinate a massive assault on the center of the Union line, employing the division of George Pickett and brigades from A.P. Hill's corps. Longstreet knew this assault had little chance of success.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The Union Army was in a position reminiscent of the one Longstreet had taken at Fredericksburg to defeat Burnside's assault.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The Confederates would have to cover almost a mile of open ground and spend time negotiating sturdy fences under fire. The lessons of Fredericksburg and Malvern Hill were lost to Lee on this day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} In his memoirs, Longstreet claims to have told Lee that he believed the attack on the Union center would fail:

{{Quote|General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, divisions, and armies, and should know, as well as any one, what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arranged for battle can take that position.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=283}}}}

During the artillery barrage that preceded the infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over the assault. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]]. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as [[Pickett's Charge]], suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.{{sfn|Alexander|1989|pp=254-265}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=385-485}}{{sfn|Tagg|1998|p=208}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=280-297}}

For years after the war, Longstreet's reputation suffered because he was blamed for the failed attack, even though Lee had ordered the advance despite Longstreet's repeated protests.{{sfn|Helen Dortch Longstreet|1904}}

===Chickamauga===
In mid-August 1863, Longstreet once again resumed his attempts to be transferred to the Western Theater. He wrote a private letter to Seddon, requesting that he be transferred to serve under his old friend Gen. Joseph Johnston. He followed this up in conversations with his congressional ally Wigfall, who had long considered Longstreet a suitable replacement for Braxton Bragg. Bragg had a poor combat record and was very unpopular with his men and officers. Since Bragg's army was under increasing pressure from Rosecrans outside of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Lee and President Davis agreed to the request on September 5. In one of the most daunting logistical efforts of the Confederacy, Longstreet, with the divisions of Lafayette McLaws and John Hood, a brigade from George Pickett's division, and Porter Alexander's 26-gun artillery battalion, traveled over 16 railroads on a {{convert|775|mi|km|0|adj=on}} route through the Carolinas to reach Bragg in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=300-305}} Although the entire operation would take over three weeks, lead elements of the corps arrived on September 17.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=305-306}}

On September 19 at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Bragg began an unsuccessful attempt to interpose his army between Rosecrans and Chattanooga before the arrival of most of Longstreet's corps.{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=81-82}} Throughout the day, Confederate troops launched largely unsuccessful assaults on Union positions that were highly costly for both sides. One of Longstreet's own divisions under Hood successfully resisted a strong Union counterattack from [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s division of the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]] that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Records'', Series I, Volume XXX, Part 1, pp. 498, 529&lt;/ref&gt; When Longstreet himself arrived on the field in the late evening, he failed to find Bragg's headquarters. He and his staff spent considerable time riding looking for them. They accidentally came across a federal picket line and were nearly captured.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=438}} When the two finally met at Bragg's headquarters late at night, Bragg placed Longstreet in command of the left wing of his army; Lt. Gen. [[Leonidas Polk]] commanded the right. On September 20, Longstreet lined up eight brigades in a deep column against a narrow front, an attack very similar to future German tank tactics in [[World War II]].{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=82-87}} The attack was supposed to begin early in the morning shortly after an assault by Polk's wing. However, confusion and mishandled orders caused Polk's attack to be delayed, and Longstreet's advance did not begin until just after 11 after hearing gunfire from his left.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=312}} By chance, a mistaken order from General Rosecrans caused a gap to appear in the Union line by transferring [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s division from the right to reinforce the [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]] under [[George Henry Thomas]] in the center.{{sfn|Cozzens|1994|p=365}}

Longstreet took additional advantage of the confusion to increase his chances of success. The organization of the attack was well suited to the terrain and would have penetrated the Union line regardless. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s division poured through the gap, driving the Union forces back.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=312-313}} After Longstreet ordered [[Thomas C. Hindman]]'s division forward, the Union right collapsed entirely.{{sfn|Alexander|1989|pp=293-294}} Rosecrans fled the field as units began to retreat in panic. Thomas managed to rally the retreating units and solidify a defensive position on Snodgrass Hill. He held that position against repeated afternoon attacks by Longstreet, who was not adequately supported by the Confederate right wing. Once night fell, the battle was over, and Thomas was able to extricate the units under his control to Chattanooga. Bragg's failure to coordinate the right wing and cavalry to further envelop Thomas prevented a total rout of the Union Army.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=313-318}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=445-479}} Bragg also neglected to pursue the retreating Federals aggressively, resulting in the futile [[Chattanooga Campaign|Siege of Chattanooga]]. He had dismissed a proposal from Longstreet that he do so, citing a lack of transportation and calling the plan a &quot;visionary scheme&quot;.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=318-319}} Nevertheless, Chickamauga was the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater and Longstreet deserved and received a good portion of the credit.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=320-322}}

===Tennessee===
Not long after the Confederates entered Tennessee following their victory at Chickamauga, Longstreet clashed with Bragg and became leader of the group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's subordinates had long been dissatisfied with his abrasive personality and poor battlefield record; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, and the fact that they quickly took their side, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, &quot;I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander.&quot; The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg &quot;was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight&quot; and that he &quot;knew nothing of the business&quot;. On October 12, Davis declared his support for Bragg. He left him and his dissatisfied subordinates in their positions.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=325-328}}

[[File:James Longstreet photograph.jpg|thumb|left|Carte de Visite portrait of Longstreet|160px]]
Bragg relieved or reassigned the generals who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units that he brought with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign.{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=83-87}} Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union [[Army of the Cumberland]] in Chattanooga. At about this time, Longstreet learned of the birth of a son, who was named Robert Lee.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=329-331}} Grant arrived in Chattanooga on October 23 and took overall command of the new Union [[Military Division of the Mississippi]]. He replaced Rosecrans with Thomas.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=306-309}}

While Longstreet's relationship with Bragg was extremely poor, his connections with his subordinates also deteriorated. He had a strong prewar friendship with McLaws, but it began to show signs of souring after McLaws blamed Longstreet for the defeat at Gettysburg and was accused by Longstreet of displaying lethargy after Chickamauga.{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=78}} Hood's old division was under the temporary command of Brigadier General [[Micah Jenkins]]. The brigadier general who had been in the division the longest was [[Evander M. Law]]. Both men disliked each other and desired permanent command of the division. Longstreet favored Jenkins, his longtime protégé, while most of the men favored Law. Longstreet had asked Davis to name a permanent commander, but he refused.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=337}}

On October 27, Union troops managed to open up a &quot;cracker line&quot; to bring food to their troops by defeating Law's brigade of Hood's division, temporarily commanded by Jenkins, at the [[Battle of Brown's Ferry]]. In the nighttime [[Battle of Wauhatchie]] from October 28–29, Jenkins failed to regain the lost position. He blamed Law and Brigadier General [[Jerome B. Robertson]] for the lack of success. Longstreet took no immediate action against Law but complained about Robertson. A court of inquiry was set up, but its proceedings were suspended and Robertson returned to command.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=332-338}} After the Confederate failures, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was [[Bridgeport, Alabama]], where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in [[Rome, Georgia]], to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis,{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=460-465}} but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=338}} and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union [[Army of the Ohio]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=338-339}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=467-481}}

Longstreet was criticized for the slow pace of his advance toward [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] in November and some of his troops began using the nickname &quot;Peter the Slow&quot; to describe him.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=357}} At the [[Battle of Campbell's Station]] on November 16, the Federals evaded Longstreet's troops. This was due both to the poor performance of Law, who exposed his brigade to the enemy and thus ruined what was supposed to be a surprise attack, and Burnside's skillful retreat. The Confederates also dealt with muddy roads and a shortage of good supplies.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=344-345}}

Burnside settled into entrenchments around the city, which Longstreet besieged. Longstreet soon learned that Bragg had been defeated at Chattanooga on November 25, and that [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s men were marching to relieve Burnside. He decided to risk a frontal attack on Union entrenchments before they arrived. On November 29, he sent his troops forward at the [[Battle of Fort Sanders]]. The attack was repulsed, and Longstreet was forced to retreat.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|pp=458-459}} When Bragg was defeated by Grant, Longstreet was ordered to join forces with the Army of Tennessee in northern Georgia. He demurred and began to move back to Virginia, soon pursued by Sherman. Longstreet defeated federal troops in an engagement at [[Battle of Bean's Station|Bean's Station]] on December 14 before the armies went into winter quarters. The greatest effect of the campaign was to deprive Bragg of troops he sorely needed in Chattanooga. Longstreet's second independent command (after Suffolk) was a failure and his self-confidence was damaged. He reacted to the failure of the campaign by blaming others. He relieved Lafayette McLaws from command and requested the court martial of Robertson and Law. He also submitted a letter of resignation to Adjutant General [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] on December 30, 1863, but his request to be relieved was denied.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=340-359; 360-375}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=480-523}}

The sufferings of the Confederate troops were to continue into the winter. Longstreet set up his headquarters in [[Rogersville, Tennessee|Rogersville]]. He attempted to keep communications open with Lee's army in Virginia, but Federal cavalry general [[William W. Averell]]'s raids destroyed the railroads, isolating him and forcing him to rely only on Eastern Tennessee for supplies. Longstreet's corps suffered through a severe winter in Eastern Tennessee with inadequate shelter and provisions. More than half of the men were without shoes.{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=459}} Writing to Georgia's Quartermaster General, [[Ira Roe Foster]] on January 24, 1864, Longstreet noted: &quot;There are five Georgia Brigades in this Army &amp;ndash; Wofford's, G.T. Anderson's, Bryan's, Benning's, and Crews' cavalry brigade. They are all alike in excessive need of shoes, clothing of all kinds, and blankets. All that you can send will be thankfully received.&quot;{{sfn|Poole|2000|p=106}} Meanwhile, Longstreet again developed strategic plans. He called for an offensive through Tennessee into Kentucky in which his command would be bolstered by P. G. T. Beauregard and 20,000 men. Although he had the concurrence of General Lee, Longstreet was unable to convince President Davis or his newly appointed military advisor, Braxton Bragg, who had finally been relieved and replaced by Joe Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee following the defeat at Chattanooga.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=369-371}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=544-546}}

In February 1864, the lines of communication were repaired. Once the weather warmed, Longstreet's men marched north and returned to the Army of Northern Virginia at [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]].{{sfn|Pollard|1866|p=459}}

===Wilderness to Appomattox===
[[File:Wilderness May6 1100.png|thumb|Longstreet's attack in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], May 6, 1864, shortly before he was wounded]]
Longstreet found out that his old friend Ulysses S. Grant had been appointed General-in-Chief of the Union Army, with headquarters in the field alongside the Army of the Potomac. Longstreet told his fellow officers that &quot;he will fight us every day and every hour until the end of the war.&quot;{{sfn|Rhea|1994|p=42}} Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee's army, the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] in May 1864.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=385-387}} After Grant moved south of the [[Rapidan River]] in an attempt to take Richmond, Lee intended to delay battle in order to give Longstreet's 14,000 men time to arrive on the field. Grant disrupted these plans by attacking him on May 5, and the fighting was inconclusive. The following morning at 5 A.M., Hancock led two divisions in a ferocious attack on A.P. Hill's corps, driving the men back two miles. Just as this was happening, Longstreet's men arrived on the field. They took advantage of an old roadbed built for an out-of-use railroad to creep through a densely wooded area unnoticed before launching a powerful flanking attack.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=379-381}} Longstreet's men moved forward along the Orange Plank Road against the II Corps and in two hours nearly drove it from the field. Once again he developed innovative tactics to deal with difficult terrain, ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines, which allowed his men to deliver a continuous fire into the enemy, while proving to be elusive targets themselves. Historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to &quot;the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength&quot;.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=385}} After the war, Hancock said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver: &quot;You rolled me up like a wet blanket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General James Longstreet.jpg|thumb|left|James Longstreet in 1865]]
Longstreet was wounded during the assault&amp;mdash;accidentally shot by his own men only about {{convert|4|mi|km}} away from the place where Stonewall Jackson suffered the same fate almost exactly a year earlier at Chancellorsville. A bullet passed through his shoulder, severing nerves, and tearing a gash in his throat. Jenkins, who was riding with Longstreet, was also shot and died from his wounds. The momentum of the attack subsided. As he was taken from the field, Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack. Instead, Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned, giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize. The subsequent attack was a failure.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=385-389}} Alexander called the removal of Longstreet the critical juncture of the battle: &quot;I have always believed that, but for Longstreet's fall, the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock's [II] Corps would have been extended &amp; have resulted in Grant's being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan.&quot;{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=360}}

Longstreet missed the rest of the 1864 spring and summer campaign, where Lee sorely missed his skill in handling the army.{{sfn|Sawyer|2005|p=63}} On May 1, he was confirmed as an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]].{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=392}} He was treated in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], and recuperated in Augusta, Georgia, with his cousin, Emma Eve Longstreet Sibley, the daughter of his father's brother, Gilbert.{{sfn|Sawyer|2005|p=63}} While in Augusta, he participated in the funeral service for Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk at Saint Paul's Church, joining the Bishops of Mississippi and Arkansas in casting earth onto the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/lpolk/funeral1864.html Project Canterbury website]&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined Lee in October 1864, with his right arm paralyzed and in a sling, initially unable to ride a horse. He had taught himself to write with his left hand; by periodically pulling on his arm, as advised by doctors, he was able to regain use of his right hand in later years.{{sfn|Welsh|1999|p=144}} At this time, Longstreet's staff underwent major changes. The most significant was the transfer of Sorrel, Longstreet's Chief of Staff, to brigade command. He was replaced by Major Osmun Latrobe.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=393-394}} For the remainder of the [[Siege of Petersburg]], Longstreet commanded the defenses in front of the capital of Richmond, including all forces north of the James River and Pickett's Division at Bermuda Hundred. He retreated with Lee in the [[Appomattox Campaign]], commanding both the First and Third Corps, following the death of A.P. Hill on April 2.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=390-403}}{{sfn|Alexander|1989|p=538}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|pp=573-631}}

As Lee's army attempted to escape to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]], Longstreet was engaged at [[Battle of Sailor's Creek|Sailor's Creek]] on April 6.{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=400}} The Confederates were unable to reach the town, but with the assistance of troops under Anderson and Ewell, managed to prevent federal troops from blocking the army's last path of escape. The overall battle ended in disaster, with nearly 7,000 of the 10,000 Confederate troops engaged killed, wounded, or captured.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger 298-300&lt;/ref&gt; By April 7, Lee's army had been reduced from nearly 40,000 men on March 31 to 25,000. A group of Confederate officers including [[William N. Pendleton]] concluded that the time had come to ask Lee to open negotiations for the army's surrender. Pendleton approached Longstreet and asked him to intercede with Lee, but he refused, saying, &quot;If General Lee doesn't know when to surrender until I tell him, he will never know.&quot; Nevertheless, Pendleton approached Lee, who was in communication with Grant on the subject of Confederate surrender, but refused to surrender the army.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger 302&lt;/ref&gt; Lee held his last conference of war on the night of April 8. It was decided that at daybreak, Longstreet would hold the Union troops back while [[John B. Gordon]] would lead an escape towards [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], and then cover his retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger 303&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]] that morning, Longstreet was heavily engaged with the Union II Corps under [[Andrew A. Humphreys]]. Gordon's troops were surrounded, and he requested reinforcements which Longstreet could not furnish. Lee was left with no alternative but to meet General Grant to discuss surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger 306-308&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee worried that his refusal to meet with Grant to discuss surrender terms at the latter's first request would cause him to demand harsher terms this time. Longstreet advised him of his belief that Grant would treat them fairly. As Lee rode toward [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, Longstreet said that if Grant gave too strong demands, he ought to &quot;break off the interview and tell General Grant to do his worst&quot;.{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=628}} After Lee's surrender, Longstreet arrived in the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]], where Grant happily greeted him. He offered Longstreet a cigar and invited him to play a card game. &quot;Why do men fight who were born to be brothers?...His whole greeting and conduct towards us was as though nothing had ever happened to mar our pleasant relations&quot;, Longstreet told a reporter.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=511}}

==Postbellum life==
[[File:JamesLongstreet.jpg|thumb|James Longstreet after the War]]
After the war, Longstreet and his family settled in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], a location popular with a number of former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created and prominent insurance company. He actively sought the presidency of the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from [[New Orleans]] around the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] south across the [[Rio Grande]] river and American-Mexican border to [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]. In 1870, he was named president of the newly organized [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]]. With Grant's support, he applied for a pardon from President [[Andrew Johnson]]. Johnson refused, however, telling Longstreet in a meeting: &quot;There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, and yourself. You have given the Union cause too much trouble.&quot; Regardless of such opposition, the Radical Republican-controlled [[United States Congress]] restored his citizenship rights in June 1868.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=407-410; 413-414}}{{sfn|Longstreet|1991|p=634}}

Longstreet was one of a small group of former Confederate generals, including [[James L. Alcorn]] and [[William Mahone]], to join or ally with the nationally dominant [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] during the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]]. He endorsed Grant for president in the election of [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]], attended his [[First inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant|inauguration ceremonies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and six days later was appointed by Grant as surveyor of [[United States Customs Service|customs]] in New Orleans. For these acts he lost favor with many white Southerners. His old friend Harvey Hill wrote to a newspaper: &quot;Our [[scalawag]] is the local leper of the community.&quot; Unlike Northerners who moved South and were sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Carpetbaggers]]&quot;, Hill wrote, Longstreet &quot;is a native, which is so much the worse&quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A major element of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] movement, aside from attacking Longstreet's war record, was the idea that the central cause of the Civil War was the protection of [[states' rights]], not [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Responding to such arguments, Longstreet once remarked, &quot;I never heard of any other cause of the quarrel than slavery.&quot;{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=857}}

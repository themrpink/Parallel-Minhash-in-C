While the Latin Church maintains the use of the [[Latin liturgical rites]], Protestant denominations and Independent Catholicism use a wide variety of liturgical practices.

For most of its history the church in Europe has been [[Greek East and Latin West|culturally divided]] between the Latin-speaking west, whose centre was [[Rome]], and the Greek-speaking east, whose centre was [[Constantinople]]. Cultural differences and political rivalry created tensions between the two churches, leading to disagreement over [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|doctrine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences|ecclesiology]] and ultimately to [[East-West schism|schism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;west_christ&quot;&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/west/westessay.html &quot;General Essay on Western Christianity&quot;], ''Overview Of World Religions''.

Like [[Eastern Christianity]], Western Christianity traces its roots directly to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and other early preachers of the religion. In Western Christianity's original area [[Latin]] was the principal language. Christian writers in Latin had more influence there than those who wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], or other Eastern languages. Though the first Christians in the West used Greek (such as [[Clement of Rome]]), by the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]] Latin had superseded it even in the cosmopolitan city of [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], while there is evidence of a Latin translation of the [[Bible]] in the 2nd century (see also [[Vetus Latina]]) in [[Early centers of Christianity#Southern Gaul|southern Gaul]] and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|Roman province of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article &quot;Latin&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], distinctions appeared also in organization, since the bishops in the West were not dependent on the [[Byzantine Empire|Emperor in Constantinople]] and did not come under the influence of the [[Caesaropapism#Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church|Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church]]. While the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|see of Constantinople]] became dominant throughout the Emperor's lands, the West looked exclusively to the [[Holy See|see of Rome]], which in the East was seen as that of one of the five [[patriarch]]s of the [[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Pentarchy]], &quot;the proposed government of universal [[Christendom]] by five [[patriarch]]al sees under the auspices of a single universal empire. Formulated in the legislation of the emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565), especially in his [[Corpus Juris Civilis#Novellae|Novella]] 131, the theory received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the [[Quinisext Council|Council in Trullo]] (692), which ranked the five sees as Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9059117/pentarchy Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Pentarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries, disagreements separated Western Christianity from the various forms of Eastern Christianity: first from [[Church of the East|East Syriac Christianity]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus (431)]], then from that of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), and then from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. With the last-named form of Eastern Christianity, reunion agreements were signed at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439), but these proved ineffective.

Historian Paul Legutko of [[Stanford University]] said the [[Catholic Church]] is &quot;at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call [[Western civilization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822150152/http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |archive-date=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[Protestantism]] led to major divisions within Western Christianity, which still persist, and wars&amp;mdash;for example, the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604]] had religious as well as economic causes.

In and after the [[Age of Discovery]], [[Europe]]ans spread Western Christianity to the [[New World]] and elsewhere. Roman Catholicism came to the Americas (especially South America), Africa, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. Protestantism, including Anglicanism, came to North America, Australia-Pacific and some African locales.

Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is now much less absolute, due to the great migrations of Europeans across the globe, as well as the work of [[missionary|missionaries]] worldwide over the past five centuries.

=== Filioque clause ===
{{See also|Filioque}}
Most Western Christians use a version of the [[Nicene Creed]] that states that the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] &quot;[[Filioque|proceeds from the Father and the Son]]&quot;, where the original text as adopted by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] had &quot;proceeds from the Father&quot; without the addition of either &quot;and the Son&quot; or &quot;alone&quot;. This Western version also has the additional phrase &quot;God from God&quot; (in [[Latin]] ''Deum de Deo''), which was in the Creed as adopted by the [[First Council of Nicaea]], but which was dropped by the First Council of Constantinople.

=== Date of Easter ===
{{Main|Easter controversy}}
The [[Easter#Date|date of Easter]] usually differs between Eastern and Western Christianity, because the calculations are based on the [[Julian calendar]] and [[Gregorian calendar]] respectively. However, before the Council of Nicea, various dates including Jewish Passover were observed. Nicea &quot;Romanized&quot; the date for Easter and anathematized a &quot;Judaized&quot; (i.e. Passover date for) Easter. The date of observance of Easter has only differed in modern times since the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar in 1582; and further, the Western Church did not universally adopt the Gregorian calendar at once, so that for some time the dates of Easter differed as between the Eastern Church and the Roman Catholic Church, but not necessarily as between the Eastern Church and the Western Protestant churches. For example, the Church of England continued to observe Easter on the same date as the Eastern Church until 1753.

Even the dates of other Christian holidays differ between Eastern and Western Christianity.

== Western denominations ==

Today, Western Christianity makes up close to 90% of [[Christianity by country|Christians worldwide]] with the Catholic Church accounting for over half and various Protestant denominations making up another 40%.

[[Hussites|Hussite]] movements of 15th century [[Bohemia]] preceded the main Protestant uprising by 100 years and evolved into several small Protestant churches, such as the [[Moravian Church]]. [[Waldensians]] survived also, but blended into the [[Reformed tradition]].

{{Eastern Christianity}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

'''Eastern Christianity''' comprises [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions and [[Christian denomination|church families]] that originally developed during [[Classical antiquity|classical]] and [[late antiquity]] in the [[Middle East]], [[Egypt]], [[Northeast Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Southeastern Europe]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Malabar coast]] of [[South India|southern India]], and parts of the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;
Historically, [[Christianity in the Persian Empire]] and in [[Nestorianism | Central Asia]] also had great importance, especially in proselytising in East and South Asia.
&lt;/ref&gt; The term does not describe a single [[Communion (Christian) |communion]] or [[religious denomination]]. Major Eastern Christian bodies include the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (which have re-established communion with [[Holy See|Rome]] but still maintain [[Christian liturgy|Eastern liturgies]]), [[Protestant Eastern Christianity|Protestant Eastern Christian churches]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HämmerliMayer2016&quot; /&gt; who are Protestant in theology but Eastern Christian in cultural practice, and the denominations descended from the historic [[Church of the East]]. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as &quot;Eastern&quot;, with the exception of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Ancient Church of the East]].

Historically the term '''Eastern Church''' was used in contrast with the (''Western'') [[Latin Church]], centered on [[Holy See|Rome]], which uses the [[Latin liturgical rites]]. The terms &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; in this regard originated with geographical divisions in Christianity mirroring the cultural divide between the [[Greek East and Latin West|Hellenistic East and the Latin West]], and the political divide of 395 AD between the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman empires]]. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, the term &quot;Eastern Christianity&quot; may be used in contrast with &quot;[[Western Christianity]]&quot;, which contains not only the Latin Church but also [[Protestantism]] and [[Independent Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSSR1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Bulletin for the Study of Religion, Volumes 9-12|year= 1978|publisher= Council on the Study of Religion|language= en|page= 29|quote= Since Eastern Christianity is difficult to define, or even to describe, the subject parameters of the proposed works will be somewhat open-ended.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another.

Because the largest church in the East is the body currently known as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the term &quot;Orthodox&quot; is often used in a similar fashion to &quot;Eastern&quot;, to refer to specific historical Christian communions. However, strictly speaking, most Christian denominations, whether Eastern or Western, regard themselves as [[Orthodoxy|&quot;orthodox&quot;]] (meaning: &quot;following correct beliefs&quot;) as well as [[Catholic (term)|&quot;catholic&quot;]] (meaning: &quot;universal&quot;), and as sharing in the [[Four Marks of the Church]] listed in the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (325 AD): &quot;One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic&quot; ({{lang-gr|μία, ἁγία, καθολικὴ καὶ ἀποστολικὴ ἐκκλησία}}).{{NoteTag|This ecumenical creed is today recited in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (both [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rites]]), the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]], the [[Moravian Church]], the [[Lutheran Church]]es, the [[Methodist Church]]es, the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Reformed Church]]es, and other [[Christian denominations]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last= Scharper |first= Philip J. |title= Meet the American Catholic |year= 1969|publisher= [[Broadman Press]]|language= en|page= 34|quote= It is interesting to note, however, that the Nicene Creed, recited by Roman Catholics in their worship, is also accepted by millions of other Christians as a testimony of their faith — Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists, Lutherans, and members of many of the Reformed Churches.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eastern churches (excepting the non-liturgical dissenting bodies) utilise several [[Christian liturgy|liturgical rites]]: the [[Alexandrian Rite]], the [[Armenian Rite]], the [[Byzantine Rite]], the [[East Syriac Rite]] (also known as Persian or Chaldean Rite), and the [[West Syriac Rite]] (also called the Antiochian Rite).

Eastern Christians do not share the same religious traditions, but do share many cultural traditions. Christianity divided itself in the East during its early centuries both within and outside of the Roman Empire in disputes about [[Christology]] and fundamental theology, as well as through national divisions (Roman, Persian, etc.). It would be many centuries later that Western Christianity fully split from these traditions as its own communion. Major branches or families of Eastern Christianity, each of which has a distinct [[theology]] and [[dogma]], include the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;HindsonMitchell2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hindson|first1=Edward E.|last2=Mitchell|first2=Daniel R.|title=The Popular Encyclopedia of Church History|date=1 August 2013|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|language=en|isbn=9780736948074|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Eastern churches, some parish priests administer the sacrament of [[chrismation]] to infants after [[baptism]], and priests are allowed to marry before ordination. While all the Eastern Catholic Churches recognize the authority of the [[Pope|Pope of Rome]], some of them who have originally been part of the Orthodox Church or Oriental Orthodox churches closely follow the traditions of Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy, including the tradition of allowing married men to become priests.

The Eastern churches' differences from Western Christianity have as much, if not more, to do with culture, language, and politics, as [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|theology]]. For the non-Catholic Eastern churches, a definitive date for the commencement of [[Schism (religion)|schism]] cannot usually be given (see [[East–West Schism]]). The Church of the East declared independence from the churches of the [[Roman Empire]] at its general council in 424, which was before the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and so had nothing to do with the theology declared at that council. Oriental Orthodoxy separated after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.

Since the time of the historian [[Edward Gibbon]], the split between the Church of Rome and the Orthodox Church has been conveniently dated to 1054, though the reality is more complex. This split is sometimes referred to as the ''Great Schism'', but now more usually referred to as the [[East–West Schism]]. This final schism reflected a larger cultural and political division which had developed in Europe and Southwest Asia during the [[Middle Ages]] and coincided with Western Europe's re-emergence from the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse of the Western Roman Empire]].

The Ukrainian Lutheran Church developed within [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] around 1926, with its rites being based on the [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]], rather than on the Western ''[[Formula missae|Formula Missae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bebis2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webber1992&quot;/&gt;

=== Eastern Orthodox Church ===
{{Further|History of the Orthodox Church}}

[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Christ Pantocrator, detail of the Deesis mosaic in [[Hagia Sophia]] – [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) 12th century]]

The Eastern Orthodox Church is a Christian body whose adherents are largely based in the Middle East (particularly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]) and [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Caucasus]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Ossetia]] etc.), with a growing presence in the [[Western world]]. Eastern Orthodox Christians accept the decisions of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|first seven ecumenical councils]].

Eastern Orthodox Christianity identifies itself as the original Christian church (see [[early centers of Christianity]]) founded by Christ and the Apostles, and traces its lineage back to the [[early church|early Church]] through the process of [[apostolic succession]] and unchanged theology and practice. Distinguishing characteristics of the Eastern Orthodox Church include the Byzantine Rite (shared with some Eastern Catholic Churches) and an emphasis on the continuation of [[Sacred tradition|Holy Tradition]], which it holds to be apostolic in nature.

The Eastern Orthodox Church is organized into self-governing jurisdictions along geographical, national, ethnic or linguistic lines. Eastern Orthodoxy is thus made up of fourteen or sixteen [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] bodies. Smaller churches are autonomous and each have a mother church that is autocephalous.

All Eastern Orthodox are united in doctrinal agreement with each other, though a few are not in communion at present, for non-doctrinal reasons. This is in contrast to the Catholic Church and its various churches. Members of the latter are all in communion with each other, parts of a top-down [[hierarchy]] (see [[primus inter pares]]).

The Eastern Orthodox reject the [[Filioque|Filioque clause]] as heresy, in sharp contrast with the majority of Catholics. Yet some Catholics who are not in communion with the Catholic Church side with the Eastern Orthodox here and reject this teaching, putting them in theological disagreement with the others.

It may also be noted that the Church of Rome was once in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church, but the two were split after the East–West Schism and thus it is no longer in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church.

It is estimated that there are approximately 240&amp;nbsp;million Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world.{{NoteTag|See details about [[major religious groups]].}} Today, many adherents shun the term &quot;Eastern&quot; as denying the church's universal character. They refer to Eastern Orthodoxy simply as the ''Orthodox Church''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ware |first=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |author-link=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |location=New York, NY |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
{{Main|Oriental Orthodox Churches}}
Oriental Orthodoxy refers to the churches of Eastern Christian tradition that keep the faith of the first three [[Ecumenical Council|ecumenical council]]s of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|undivided Christian Church]]: the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (AD 325), the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) and the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), while rejecting the [[dogmatic definition]]s of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). Hence, these churches are also called the ''Old Oriental churches''. They comprise the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite Syrian Church of Antioch]] and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

Oriental Orthodoxy developed in reaction to Chalcedon on the eastern limit of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and in [[Egypt]], Syria and [[Mesopotamia]]. In those locations, there are also Eastern Orthodox [[patriarch]]s, but the rivalry between the two has largely vanished in the centuries since the schism.

=== Church of the East ===
{{Main|Church of the East|Nestorianism|Lakhmids}}
Historically, the Church of the East was the widest reaching branch of Eastern Christianity, at its height spreading from its heartland in [[Persia]]n-ruled [[Assyria]] to the Mediterranean, India, and China. Originally the only Christian church recognized by [[Zoroastrian]]-led [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]] (through its alliance with the Lakhmids, the regional rivals to the Byzantines and its [[Ghassanid]] vassal), the Church of the East declared itself independent of other churches in 424 and over the next century became affiliated with Nestorianism, a Christological doctrine advanced by [[Nestorius]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 428 to 431, which had been declared heretical in the Roman Empire. Thereafter it was often known, possibly inaccurately, as the Nestorian Church in the West. Surviving a period of persecution within Persia, the Church of the East flourished under the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and branched out, establishing dioceses throughout Asia. After another period of expansion under the [[Mongol Empire]], the church went into decline starting in the 14th century, and was eventually largely confined to its founding [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] adherent's heartland in the [[Assyrian homeland]], although another remnant survived on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India.

In the 16th century, dynastic struggles sent the church into schism, resulting in the formation of two rival churches: The [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], which entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church, and the Assyrian Church of the East. The followers of these two churches are almost exclusively ethnic Assyrians. In India, the local Church of the East community, known as the Saint Thomas Christians, experienced its own rifts as a result of Portuguese influence.

==== Assyrian Church of the East ====
{{Main|Church of the East|Assyrian Church of the East}}
The Assyrian Church of the East emerged from the historical Church of the East, which was centered in Mesopotamia/Assyria, then part of the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]], and spread widely throughout Asia. The modern Assyrian Church of the East emerged in the 16th century following a split with the Chaldean Church, which later entered into communion with Rome as an Eastern Catholic Church.

The Church of the East was associated with the doctrine of Nestorianism, advanced by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 – 431, which emphasized the disunion between the human and divine natures of [[Jesus]]. Nestorius and his doctrine were condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, leading to the [[Nestorian Schism]] in which churches supporting Nestorius split from the rest of Christianity.

Many followers relocated to Persia and became affiliated with the local Christian community there. This community adopted an increasingly Nestorian theology and was thereafter often known as the Nestorian Church. As such, the Church of the East accepts only the first two ecumenical councils of the undivided Church—the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople—as defining its faith tradition, and rapidly took a different course from other Eastern Christians.

The Church of the East spread widely through Persia and into Asia, being introduced to India by the 6th century and to the Mongols and China in the 7th century. It experienced periodic expansion until the 14th century, when the church was nearly destroyed by the collapse of the Mongol Empire and the conquests of [[Timur]]. By the 16th century it was largely confined to Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest [[Iran]] and the Malabar Coast of India ([[Kerala]]). The split of the 15th century, which saw the emergence of separate Assyrian and Chaldean Churches, left only the former as an independent sect. Additional splits into the 20th century further affected the history of the Assyrian Church of the East.

==== Saint Thomas Christians ====
{{Main|Saint Thomas Christians}}
The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] are an ancient body of Christians on the southwest coast of [[India]] who trace their origins to the evangelical activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM&quot;&gt;A. E. Medlycott, ''India and The Apostle Thomas'', pp.1-71, 213-97; M. R. James, ''Apocryphal New Testament'', pp.364-436; Eusebius, ''History'', chapter 4:30; [[J. N. Farquhar]], ''The Apostle Thomas in North India'', chapter 4:30; V. A. Smith, ''Early History of India'', p.235; L. W. Brown, ''The Indian Christians of St. Thomas'', p.49-59&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th century the Saint Thomas Christians were part of the Church of the East, or Nestorian Church. Until the middle of the 17th century and the arrival of the Portuguese, the Thomas Christians were all one in faith and rite. Thereafter, divisions arose among them, and consequently they are today of several different rites.

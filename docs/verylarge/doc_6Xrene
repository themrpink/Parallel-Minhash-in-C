==Categorical interpretation==
One may elegantly define the closure operator in terms of universal arrows, as follows.

The [[powerset]] of a set ''X'' may be realized as a [[partial order]] [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''P'' in which the objects are subsets and the morphisms are inclusions &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt; whenever ''A'' is a subset of ''B''. Furthermore, a topology ''T'' on ''X'' is a subcategory of ''P'' with inclusion functor &lt;math&gt;I: T \to P&lt;/math&gt;. The set of closed subsets containing a fixed subset &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with the comma category &lt;math&gt; (A \downarrow I)&lt;/math&gt;. This category &amp;mdash; also a partial order &amp;mdash; then has initial object Cl(''A''). Thus there is a universal arrow from ''A'' to ''I'', given by the inclusion &lt;math&gt;A \to Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, since every closed set containing ''X'' \ ''A'' corresponds with an open set contained in ''A'' we can interpret the category &lt;math&gt; (I \downarrow X \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt; as the set of open subsets contained in ''A'', with terminal object &lt;math&gt;\text{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''A''.

All properties of the closure can be derived from this definition and a few properties of the above categories. Moreover, this definition makes precise the analogy between the topological closure and other types of closures (for example [[algebraic closure|algebraic]]), since all are examples of universal arrows.

'''Marien Ngouabi''' (or '''N'Gouabi''') (December 31, 1938 – March 18, 1977) was the third President of the [[Republic of the Congo]] from January 1, 1969, to March 18, 1977.

==Biography==

===Origins===
Marien Ngouabi was born in 1938 at the village of Ombellé, [[Cuvette Department]], in Kouyou territory to Dominique Osséré m'Opoma and Antoinette Mboualé-Abemba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consulatgeneralcongo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=167|language=French|date=17 August 2014|title=Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville|publisher=Consulate General of Congo in Tunis}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was of humble origin. From 1947 to 1953, he went to primary school in [[Owando]]. On 14 September 1953, he went to study at the ''Ecole des enfants de troupes Général Leclerc'' in [[Brazzaville]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DOSSIER DE DIGITAL CAFE2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://digitalcafe.over-blog.org/article-17800565.html |language=French |accessdate= 2017-09-03 |title= DOSSIER DE DIGITAL CAFE |publisher= Blogspot |date= 14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1957, he was sent to [[Bouar]], [[Oubangui-Chari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]).

After serving in [[Cameroon]] as a member of the second battalion of the [[Tirailleur|tirailleurs]] with the rank of Sergeant (1958–1960),&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot; /&gt; Ngouabi went to the ''Ecole Militaire Préparatoire'' in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]] in September 1960&lt;ref name=&quot;DOSSIER DE DIGITAL CAFE2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot; /&gt; and then to the ''Ecole Inter-armes'' at [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Coëtquidan Saint-Cyr]] in 1961. He returned to Congo in 1962 as Second Lieutenant and was stationed at the [[Pointe-Noire]] garrison. He was assigned to the Pointe-Noire garrison as a deputy commander of an infantry battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot; /&gt; In 1963, Ngouabi was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.

===Rise to power===
In 1965, he created the first battalion of [[paratrooper]]s in the Congo Republic. Known for his leftist views, in April 1966 Ngouabi was demoted to the rank of soldier second class when he refused to be posted again at Pointe-Noire, after rebelling against the army's inflexibility in politics and voicing strong criticism to the president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot; /&gt; President [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]] had Ngouabi and Second Lieutenant Eyabo arrested on July 29, 1968.

Ngouabi's arrest provoked discontent among the military, and on July 31, Ngouabi was freed by soldiers form the Civil Defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liste des présidents de la République du Congo Brazzaville2014&quot; /&gt; The National Revolutionary Council (CNR), headed by Ngouabi, was created on August 5, 1968. On 1 October 1968, he was promoted to the rank of Commanding Officer, a rank he held until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOSSIER DE DIGITAL CAFE2008&quot; /&gt; Massamba-Débat, whose powers had been curtailed by the CNR, resigned on September 4, and Prime Minister [[Alfred Raoul]] served as acting head of state until December 31, 1968, when the CNR formally became the country's supreme authority and Ngouabi, as head of the CNR, assumed the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://congagora.org/ngolongolo2.html &quot;L'histoire du Parti Congolais du Travail: de Marien Ngouabi à Denis Sassou Nguesso.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314155045/http://congagora.org/ngolongolo2.html |date=2008-03-14 }}, congagora.org {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head of state===
Once in power, President Ngouabi changed the country's name to the [[People's Republic of the Congo]], declaring it to be [[Africa]]'s first Marxist–Leninist state, and founded the [[Congolese Party of Labour|Congolese Workers' Party]] (''Parti Congolais du Travail'', PCT) as the country's sole legal political party.

Ngouabi was a [[Mbochi people|Koyo]] from the north and his regime shifted control of the country away from the south. Such moves created opposition among the population in the highly politicized environment of [[Brazzaville]]. Bureaucratic centralism, repression, the &quot;mechanism&quot; of the party apparatus, and Ngouabi's tribalist orientation towards Mboshi and La Cuvette immigrants created opposition within the Communist Party itself, especially its youth organization. In the fall of 1971, student and school strikes in [[Brazzaville]] and [[Pointe Noire]] began, severely repressed by the authorities. The situation in the country was severely destabilized. There was an attempted coup in February 1972 that triggered a series of 'purges' of the opposition. It is claimed that Ngouabi was under [[France|French]] pressure to annex the [[petroleum|oil]]-rich [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] [[enclave]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, a part of [[Portuguese Angola]], and his refusal to act cost him French support. There is some speculation that the French financed some of the following attempts to remove Ngouabi. Starting in February 1973, the army began military operations in the Goma Tse-tse region to dismantle the Diawara maquis. During the same month, Ngouabi denounced another attempted Diawara coup and arrested 45 people, including Pascal Lissouba and Sylvain Bemba, Minister of Information. His trial took place from March 16 to 23. Several sentences were pronounced, while Lissouba was acquitted.

The M22 business abruptly ended on April 24, 1973 with the capture and execution of the maquis. The bodies of Diawara, Ikoko and Bakekolo were toured around Brazzaville and exhibited by Ngouabi in person during a popular gathering held at the Stade de la Révolution. The lack of consideration for the lifeless bodies of the Maquis negatively affected the national opinion that was impacted on their Bantu sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.es/Crimes-sang-pouvoir-Congo-Brazzaville/dp/2747589536&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://zenga-mambu.com/2017/02/05/il-etait-une-fois-ange-diawara/&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the [[People's Republic of China]] in July 1973. 

Ngouabi was re-elected to his post as Chairman of the PCT Central Committee on December 30, 1974; he was additionally elected as Permanent Secretary of the PCT. He was then sworn in as President for another term on January 9, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keesings.com/search?kssp_selected_tab=article&amp;kssp_a_id=26964n01cog &quot;Feb 1975 - CONGO&quot;], Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 21, February, 1975 Congo, Page 26964.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1975, he signed an economic aid pact with the [[Soviet Union]].

On March 23, Lieutenant General Pierre Kinganga, in exile in Kinshasa since his alleged June 1969 attempt, disembarked in Brazzaville at the head of a command attempting to overthrow the Ngouabi regime. His attempt failed and he was shot dead near the national radio station he had just taken. His body and that of his command members who fell with him remained exposed for a long time in front of the radio building. Several enthusiastic young supporters who had joined Kinganga's column were also armed.&lt;ref&gt;https://n3k6.wordpress.com/tag/pierre-kinganga/&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Augustin Poignet, also involved, managed to escape to [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]]. A week later, 3 accomplices (Miawouama, Nkoutou and Mengo), sentenced by a court-martial, were executed. The command members and accomplices in the army and gendarmerie were convicted by the revolutionary court. After the events, Marien Ngouabi denounced the involvement of the CIA and President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo in the coup.

Following this attempt, the PCT met in an extraordinary congress from March 30 to April 2, 1970. The Political Bureau was expanded to 10 members, to the benefit of Ambroise Noumazalaye and Captain Sassou N'Guesso. The Gendarmerie, whose loyalty was not complete during the events, dissolved and its members joined the army. The Council of State was reorganized.

On August 29, 1970, former Minister Stéphane-Maurice Bongo-Nouarra was arrested for a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. He was sentenced to 10 years of forced labor.

===Assassination===
On March 18, 1977, at 14:30 hours,&lt;ref name=&quot;DOSSIER DE DIGITAL CAFE2008&quot; /&gt; President Ngouabi was assassinated. Those accused of taking part in the assassination were tried and some were executed including [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat|Massamba-Débat]].

In the aftermath of the assassination, the [[Military Committee of the Congolese Labour Party|Military Committee of the Party]] (CMP) was named to head an interim government with the conservative Colonel [[Joachim Yhombi-Opango]] to serve as Head of State.

==Commemoration==
March 18 is '''Marien Ngouabi Day''' in the Republic of Congo.

The country's only university is the [[Marien Ngouabi University]] in Brazzaville. Ngouabi is interred at the Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum in Brazzaville.

'''''The Wicker Man''''' is a 1973 British [[Horror film#Folk horror|folk horror]] film directed by [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]] and starring [[Edward Woodward]], [[Britt Ekland]], [[Diane Cilento]], [[Ingrid Pitt]], and [[Christopher Lee]].  The screenplay by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], inspired by [[David Pinner]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]'', centres on the visit of Police Sergeant Neil Howie to the isolated island of Summerisle, in search of a missing girl. Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned [[Christianity]] and now practice a form of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic paganism]]. [[Paul Giovanni]] composed the film score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bac941d|title=The Wicker Man (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Wicker Man 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95785/The-Wicker-Man/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 1973|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wicker Man'' is generally well-regarded by critics. Film magazine ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' described it as &quot;The ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of horror movies&quot;, and in 2004 ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named ''The Wicker Man'' the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], the burning Wicker Man scene was No. 45 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]'', and during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] the film was included as part of a sequence that celebrated British cinema. In 2013, a copy of the original U.S. theatrical version was digitally restored and released.

In 1989, Shaffer wrote a [[Film treatment|script treatment]] for ''The Loathsome Lambton Worm'', a direct sequel with fantasy elements. Hardy had no interest in the project, and it was never produced. In 2006, an ill-received&lt;ref&gt;''The Wicker Man'' (2006) has a [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wicker_man_2006/ 15% rating] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|American remake]] was released, from which Hardy and others involved with the original have dissociated themselves. In 2011, a [[Spiritual successor|spiritual sequel]] directed by Hardy entitled ''[[The Wicker Tree]]'' was released, and featured Lee in a cameo appearance.

==Plot==
Police Sergeant Neil Howie journeys by seaplane to the remote [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, about whom he has received an anonymous letter. Howie, a devout [[Christianity|Christian]], is disturbed to find the Islanders paying homage to the [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Celts|Celtic]] gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the [[May Day#Traditional May Day celebrations|May Day celebrations]], teach children of the phallic association of the [[maypole]], and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's own mother, appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.

While staying at the [[Green Man]] Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the [[May Queen]]. The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow, attempts to seduce Howie, but despite his inner turmoil he refuses her advances. He enters the local school and enquires about Rowan among the students, but all deny her existence. He checks the school register and finds Rowan's name in it. He questions the schoolteacher and she tells him about her burial plot.

After seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle, grandson of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Agronomy|agronomist]], to obtain permission for an exhumation. Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in [[Climate of Scotland|Scotland's climate]], and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced pagan religion.

Howie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes; the harvest had failed. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next harvest will be bountiful. He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. Realising he is out of his depth, Howie returns to his seaplane only to discover it is no longer functional, preventing him from leaving or calling for assistance. Later that day during the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of [[Punch and Judy|Punch]], the fool) and infiltrate the parade. When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her into a cave. Exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.

Summerisle tells Howie that Rowan was never the intended sacrifice: Howie himself is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, has &quot;the power of a king&quot; (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a fool. Defiant, Howie loudly warns Summerisle and the islanders that the fruit-tree strains are failing permanently and that the villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails as well; Summerisle angrily insists that the sacrifice of the &quot;willing, king-like, virgin fool&quot; will be accepted and that the next harvest will not fail. The villagers force Howie inside a giant [[Wicker Man|wicker man statue]] along with various animals, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the [[Middle English]] folk song &quot;[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]&quot;. Inside the wicker man, a terrified Howie recites [[Psalm 23]], and prays to God before cursing the islanders as he and the animals burn to death. The head of the wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.

===Background===
[[File:Christopher Lee, Women's World Awards 2009 a.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Christopher Lee|Sir Christopher Lee]], who appeared in more than 275 motion pictures, considered ''The Wicker Man'' his best film.&lt;ref name=TFInterview /&gt;]]
In the early 1970s, Christopher Lee was a [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]] regular, best known for his roles in a series of successful films, beginning with ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (as [[Frankenstein's monster|the monster]], 1957). Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles. The idea for The Wicker Man film began in 1971 when Lee met with screenwriter [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], and they agreed to work together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.steve-p.org/wm/ THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE WICKER MAN]&lt;/ref&gt; Film director [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]] and [[British Lion Films|British Lion]] head [[Peter_Snell_(producer)|Peter Snell]] became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centering on &quot;old religion&quot;, in sharp contrast to the Hammer films they had both seen as horror film fans.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Applebaum [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-wicker-man-caught-in-the-crossfire-412303.html &quot;The Wicker Man: Caught in the crossfire&quot;], ''The Independent'', 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaffer read the [[David Pinner]] novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]'', in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the [[ritual murder]] of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Pinner originally wrote ''Ritual'' as a film treatment for director [[Michael Winner]], who had [[John Hurt]] in mind as a possible star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|title=Wicker Man Trivia|publisher=Wicker-Man.com|accessdate=11 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210205628/http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|archivedate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winner eventually declined the project, so Pinner's agent convinced him to write ''Ritual'' as a novel instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b-music-collective.blogspot.com/2011/12/david-pinner-interview-cult-of-david.html|title=David Pinner Interview - The Cult of David Pinner|author=Orphan, David|publisher=B-Music Collective|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 for the rights to the novel, and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay. He soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well and drafted a new story based only loosely on the story of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/leisure/8985362.The_author_who_inspired_The_Wicker_Man___/ |title=The author who inspired The Wicker Man... |author=Gore, Will |publisher=Surrey Comet |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826092935/http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/leisure/8985362.The_author_who_inspired_The_Wicker_Man___/ |archivedate=26 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaffer wanted the film to be &quot;a little more literate&quot; than the average horror picture. He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he &quot;finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice.&quot; The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from one sentence in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|account of his wars]] in what is now France. Caesar claimed that the local tribes there had executed their most serious criminals by burning them alive in a huge man-shaped sculpture of woven twigs. For Shaffer, this was &quot;the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lori Anderson [http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/film/lori-anderson-worship-at-the-feet-of-the-wicker-man-1-3104662 &quot;Worship at the feet of The Wicker Man&quot;], ''The Scotsman'', 21 Septemberv 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote, pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer, who performed painstaking research on paganism. Brainstorming with Hardy, they conceived the film as presenting the pagan elements objectively and accurately, accompanied by authentic music and a believable, contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s1play.com/onstage/show/an-appointment-with-the-wicker-man-2/|title=An Appointment with the Wicker Man – preview, theatre listings and showing times|author=Brown, Allan|publisher=s1play.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their main resources was ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', a study of mythology and religion written by Scottish anthropologist [[James George Frazer|James Frazer]].&lt;ref&gt;Melanie J.

===Casting===
Television actor Edward Woodward was cast in the role of Sergeant Neil Howie after the part was declined by both [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] and [[David Hemmings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stevephilips&quot; /&gt; In Britain, Woodward was best known for the role of [[Callan (TV series)|''Callan'']], which he played from 1967 to 1972. After ''The Wicker Man'', Woodward went on to receive international attention for his roles in the 1980 film [[Breaker Morant (film)|''Breaker Morant'']] and the 1980s TV series ''[[The Equalizer]]''.

After Shaffer saw her on the stage, he lured [[Diane Cilento]] out of semi-retirement to play the town's schoolmistress.&lt;ref name=&quot;stevephilips&quot; /&gt; (They lived together in Queensland from 1975, and married in 1985.) [[Ingrid Pitt]], another British horror film veteran, was cast as the town librarian and registrar. The Swedish actress Britt Ekland was cast as the innkeeper's lascivious daughter, although two body doubles were used for her naked scenes below the waist. Ekland found out that she was three months pregnant with her son Nic, to [[Lou Adler]] two weeks into filming. Stuart Hopps (the film's choreographer) called upon Lorraine Peters, a nightclub dancer from Glasgow who gyrated at the doorway&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garycarpenter.net/archive/wicker3.htm|title=Gary Carpenter: The Wicker Man: Settling the Score|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the wall scenes although, in reality, the bedrooms of Willow and Sergeant Howie were not &quot;through the wall&quot; from each other: Willow's was upstairs in the Cally Estates offices in [[Gatehouse of Fleet]] whilst Howie's was {{convert|35|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} away in a family home in George Street of [[Whithorn]]. Her speaking and singing voices were dubbed by [[Annie Ross]] and Rachel Verney respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/scots-singing-legend-annie-ross-1116107|title=Scots singing legend Annie Ross talks Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday &amp; Judy Garland ahead of appearance at Glasgow Film Festival|accessdate=3 September 2017|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/a-very-nasty-piece-of-work-9269029.html|title=A very nasty piece of work|accessdate=3 September 2017|date=21 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

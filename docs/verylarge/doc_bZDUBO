[[File:1896 Olympic games countries.PNG|thumb|Participating countries]]

The concept of national teams was not a major part of the Olympic movement until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|Intercalated Games]] 10 years later, though many sources list the nationality of competitors in 1896 and give medal counts. There are significant conflicts with regard to which nations competed. The International Olympic Committee gives a figure of 14, but does not list them.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCA&quot; /&gt; The following 14 are most likely the ones recognised by the IOC. Some sources list 12, excluding Chile and Bulgaria; others list 13, including those two but excluding Italy. Egypt is also sometimes included because of [[Dionysios Kasdaglis]]' participation. Belgium and Russia had entered the names of competitors, but withdrew.

== Medal count ==
{{details|1896 Summer Olympics medal table}}
Ten of the 14 participating nations earned medals, in addition to three medals won by [[Mixed team at the Olympics|mixed teams]], i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;medal count&quot; /&gt; The United States won the most gold medals* (11), while host nation Greece won the most medals overall (46) as well as the most silver* (17) and bronze* (19) medals, finishing with one fewer gold medal than the United States, having 155 athletes more than the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;medal count&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2020}}
{{further|Baiyue#Language|Chu (state)#Language|Tai languages|Tai peoples}}
The Thai language is classified as a Tai language, closely related to other [[Southwestern Tai languages]] including Lao, [[Shan language|Shan]] in [[Myanma]]r, and numerous indigenous languages spoken in an arc from [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] south through Laos and Northern Vietnam to the Cambodian border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the [[Thai alphabet]].

Thai has undergone various historical sound changes.  Some of the most significant changes occurred during the evolution from Old Thai to modern Thai. The Thai writing system has an eight-century history and many of these changes, especially in consonants and tones, are evidenced in the modern [[Thai alphabet|orthography]].

===Old Thai===
Old Thai had a three-way tone distinction on live syllables (those not ending in a stop), with no possible distinction on dead syllables (those ending in a stop, i.e. either {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}} or the [[glottal stop]] which automatically closes syllables otherwise ending in a short vowel).

There was a two-way voiced vs. voiceless distinction among all [[fricative]] and [[sonorant]] consonants, and up to a four-way distinction among [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate]]s.  The maximal four-way occurred in [[labial consonant|labial]]s ({{IPA|/p pʰ b ʔb/}}) and [[dental consonant|dental]]s ({{IPA|/t tʰ d ʔd/}}); the three-way distinction among [[velar consonant|velar]]s ({{IPA|/k kʰ ɡ/}}) and [[palatal consonant|palatal]]s ({{IPA|/tɕ tɕʰ dʑ/}}), with the glottalized member of each set apparently missing.

The major change between old and modern Thai was due to voicing distinction losses and the concomitant [[tone split]].  This may have happened between about 1300 and 1600 CE, possibly occurring at different times in different parts of the Thai-speaking area.  All voiced–voiceless pairs of consonants lost the voicing distinction:
*Plain voiced stops ({{IPA|/b d ɡ dʑ/}}) became voiceless aspirated stops ({{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ tɕʰ/}}).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=&quot;Explanation 4&quot;&gt;The glottalized stops {{IPA|/ʔb ʔd/}} were unaffected, as they were treated in every respect like voiceless unaspirated stops due to the initial glottal stop. These stops are often described in the modern language as phonemically plain stops {{IPA|/b d/}}, but the glottalization is still commonly heard.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Voiced fricatives became voiceless.
*Voiceless sonorants became voiced.
However, in the process of these mergers the former distinction of voice was transferred into a new set of tonal distinctions.  In essence, every tone in Old Thai split into two new tones, with a lower-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiced consonant, and a higher-pitched tone corresponding to a syllable that formerly began with a voiceless consonant (including glottalized stops).  An additional complication is that formerly voiceless unaspirated stops/affricates (original {{IPA|/p t k tɕ ʔb ʔd/}}) also caused original tone 1 to lower, but had no such effect on original tones 2 or 3.

The above consonant mergers and tone splits account for the complex relationship between spelling and sound in modern Thai.  Modern &quot;low&quot;-class consonants were voiced in Old Thai, and the terminology &quot;low&quot; reflects the lower tone variants that resulted.  Modern &quot;mid&quot;-class consonants were voiceless unaspirated stops or affricates in Old Thai—precisely the class that triggered lowering in original tone 1 but not tones 2 or 3.  Modern &quot;high&quot;-class consonants were the remaining voiceless consonants in Old Thai (voiceless fricatives, voiceless sonorants, voiceless aspirated stops).  The three most common tone &quot;marks&quot; (the lack of any tone mark, as well as the two marks termed ''mai ek'' and ''mai tho'') represent the three tones of Old Thai, and the complex relationship between tone mark and actual tone is due to the various tonal changes since then.  Since the tone split, the tones have changed in actual representation to the point that the former relationship between lower and higher tonal variants has been completely obscured.  Furthermore, the six tones that resulted after the three tones of Old Thai were split have since merged into five in standard Thai, with the lower variant of former tone 2 merging with the higher variant of former tone 3, becoming the modern &quot;falling&quot; tone.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=&quot;Explanation 5&quot;&gt;Modern [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Northern Thai language|northern Thai dialects]] are often described as having six tones, but these are not necessarily due to preservation of the original six tones resulting from the tone split.  For example, in standard Lao, both the high and low variants of Old Thai tone 2 merged; however, the mid-class variant of tone 1 became pronounced differently from either the high-class or low-class variants, and all three eventually became phonemic due to further changes, e.g. {{IPA|/kr/}} &gt; {{IPA|/kʰ/}}.  For similar reasons, Lao has developed more than two tonal distinctions in &quot;dead&quot; syllables.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Old Thai====
{{further|Proto-Tai}}
Early Old Thai also apparently had velar fricatives {{IPA|/x ɣ/}} as distinct phonemes.  These were represented by the now-obsolete letters ฃ ''kho khuat'' and ฅ ''kho khon'', respectively.  During the Old Thai period, these sounds merged into the corresponding stops {{IPA|/kʰ ɡ/}}, and as a result the use of these letters became unstable.

At some point in the history of Thai, a palatal nasal phoneme {{IPA|/ɲ/}} also existed, inherited from [[Proto-Tai]].  A letter ญ ''yo ying'' also exists, which is used to represent a palatal nasal in words borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and is currently pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a syllable but {{IPA|/n/}} at the end of a syllable.  Most native Thai words that are reconstructed as beginning with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} are also pronounced {{IPA|/j/}} in modern Thai, but generally spelled with ย ''yo yak'', which consistently represents {{IPA|/j/}}.  This suggests that {{IPA|/ɲ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/j/}} in native words occurred in the pre-literary period.  It is unclear whether Sanskrit and Pali words beginning with {{IPA|/ɲ/}} were borrowed directly with a {{IPA|/j/}}, or whether a {{IPA|/ɲ/}} was re-introduced, followed by a second change {{IPA|/ɲ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/j/}}.

Proto-Tai also had a glottalized palatal sound, reconstructed as {{IPA|/ʔj/}} in Li Fang-Kuei (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}).  Corresponding Thai words are generally spelled หย, which implies an Old Thai pronunciation of {{IPA|/hj/}} (or {{IPA|/j̊/}}), but a few such words are spelled อย, which implies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/ʔj/}} and suggests that the glottalization may have persisted through to the early literary period.

===Vowel developments===
The vowel system of modern Thai contains nine pure vowels and three centering diphthongs, each of which can occur short or long. According to Li (1977{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), however, many Thai dialects have only one such short–long pair ({{IPA|/a aː/}}), and in general it is difficult or impossible to find minimal short–long pairs in Thai that involve vowels other than {{IPA|/a/}} and where both members have frequent correspondences throughout the Tai languages.  More specifically, he notes the following facts about Thai:
*In [[open syllable]]s, only long vowels occur. (This assumes that all apparent cases of short open syllables are better described as ending in a glottal stop.  This makes sense from the lack of tonal distinctions in such syllables, and the glottal stop is also reconstructible across the Tai languages.)
*In [[closed syllable]]s, the long high vowels {{IPA|/iː ɯː uː/}} are rare, and cases that do exist typically have diphthongs in other Tai languages.
*In closed syllables, both short and long mid {{IPA|/e eː o oː/}} and low {{IPA|/ɛ ɛː ɔ ɔː/}} do occur.  However, generally, only words with short {{IPA|/e o/}} and long {{IPA|/ɛː ɔː/}} are reconstructible back to Proto-Tai.
*Both of the mid back unrounded vowels {{IPA|/ɤ ɤː/}} are rare, and words with such sounds generally cannot be reconstructed back to Proto-Tai.
Furthermore, the vowel that corresponds to short Thai {{IPA|/a/}} has a different and often higher quality in many of the Tai languages compared with the vowel corresponding to Thai {{IPA|/aː/}}.

This leads Li to posit the following:
#Proto-Tai had a system of nine pure vowels with no length distinction, and possessing approximately the same qualities as in modern Thai: high {{IPA|/i ɯ u/}}, mid {{IPA|/e ɤ o/}}, low {{IPA|/ɛ a ɔ/}}.
#All Proto-Tai vowels were lengthened in open syllables, and low vowels were also lengthened in closed syllables.
#Modern Thai largely preserved the original lengths and qualities, but lowered {{IPA|/ɤ/}} to {{IPA|/a/}}, which became short {{IPA|/a/}} in closed syllables and created a phonemic length distinction {{IPA|/a aː/}}.  Eventually, length in all other vowels became phonemic as well and a new {{IPA|/ɤ/}} (both short and long) was introduced, through a combination of borrowing and sound change.  Li believes that the development of long {{IPA|/iː ɯː uː/}} from diphthongs, and the lowering of {{IPA|/ɤ/}} to {{IPA|/a/}} to create a length distinction {{IPA|/a aː/}}, had occurred by the time of Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but the other missing modern Thai vowels had not yet developed.

Note that not all researchers agree with Li.  Pittayaporn (2009{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}), for example, reconstructs a similar system for Proto-Southwestern-Tai, but believes that there was also a mid back unrounded vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} (which he describes as {{IPA|/ɤ/}}), occurring only before final velar {{IPA|/k ŋ/}}.  He also seems to believe that the Proto-Southwestern-Tai vowel length distinctions can be reconstructed back to similar distinctions in Proto-Tai.

===Connection to ancient Yue language(s)===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=May 2020}}
{{further|Baiyue#Language|Chu_(state)#Linguistic_influences}}
Thai descends from proto-Tai-Kadai, which has been hypothesized to originate in the Lower Yangtze valleys. Ancient Chinese texts refer to non-Sinitic languages spoken cross this substantial region and their speakers as ''&quot;[[Baiyue#Language|Yue]]&quot;''. Although those languages are extinct, traces of their existence could be found in unearthed inscriptional materials, ancient Chinese historical texts and non-Han substrata in various Southern Chinese dialects. Thai, as the most-spoken language in the [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai language family]], has been used extensively in historical-comparative linguistics to identify the origins of language(s) spoken in the ancient region of South China. One of the very few direct records of non-Sinitic speech in pre-Qin and Han times having been preserved so far is the ''&quot;[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]&quot;'' (Yueren Ge 越人歌), which was transcribed phonetically in Chinese characters in 528 BC, and found in the 善说 Shanshuo chapter of the Shuoyuan 说苑 or 'Garden of Persuasions'.  In the early 80's the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] linguist Wei Qingwen using reconstructed Old Chinese for the characters discovered that the resulting vocabulary showed strong resemblance to [[Zhuang language|modern Zhuang]].{{sfn|Edmondson|2007|p= 16}} Later, Zhengzhang Shangfang (1991) followed Wei's insight but used [[Thai script]] for comparison, since this orthography dates from the 13th century and preserves archaisms vis-à-vis the modern pronunciation.{{sfn|Zhengzhang|1991|pp= 159–168}} The following is a simplified interpretation of the ''&quot;[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]&quot;'' by Zhengzhang Shangfang quoted by David Holm (2013) with Thai script and Chinese glosses being omitted.{{sfn|Holm|2013|pp= 784-785}} The upper row represents the original text, the next row the Old Chinese pronunciation, the third a transcription of written Thai, and the fourth line English glosses. Finally, there is Zhengzhang's English translation.

Concentrated anthrax spores were used for bioterrorism in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America—Case Closed?|publisher=SkyhorsePublishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=https://archive.org/details/anthraxlettersbi0000cole|url-status=live|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were sent to several news media offices and two Democratic senators: [[Tom Daschle]] of South Dakota and [[Patrick Leahy]] of Vermont.

Due to these events, the US Postal Service installed [[Autonomous Detection System|biohazard detection systems]] at its major distribution centers to actively scan for anthrax being transported through the mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title       = Cepheid, Northrop Grumman Enter into Agreement for the Purchase of Anthrax Test Cartridges |publisher   = Security Products |date        = 16 August 2007 |url         = http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |accessdate  = 26 March 2009 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031354/http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |archivedate = 16 July 2011 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2020, no positive alerts by these systems have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/news/state-releases/sc/2013/FAQ-BDS.pdf|title=USPS BDS FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decontaminating mail ====
In response to the postal anthrax attacks and hoaxes, the United States Postal Service sterilized some mail using gamma [[irradiation]] and treatment with a proprietary [[enzyme]] formula supplied by Sipco Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/news/facts/lfu_021202.htm|accessdate=13 August 2008|title=Latest Facts Update |date=12 February 2002|publisher=USPS|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509204939/http://www.usps.com/news/facts/lfu_021202.htm |archivedate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scientific experiment performed by a high school student, later published in the ''Journal of Medical Toxicology'', suggested a domestic [[ironing|electric iron]] at its hottest setting (at least {{convert|400|°F|°C}}) used for at least 5 minutes should destroy all anthrax spores in a common postal envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seventeen-year-old devises anthrax deactivator |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator |publisher=[[NBC News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007082027/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator/ |archivedate=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular culture ===
In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', anthrax bombs are mentioned as the primary weapon by means of which original modern society is terrorised and in large part eradicated, to be replaced by a dystopian society.

The episode &quot;Diagnosis: Danger&quot; from the series [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]] concerns Health Department officials working to contain an anthrax outbreak.

Anthrax attacks have featured in the storylines of various television episodes and films. A ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode follows the attempt to identify an attacker who released anthrax spores in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Amplification |series=[[Criminal Minds]] |date=13 May 2009 |url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/episodes/25226/ |network=[[CBS]] |season=4 |number=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American 2001 [[Live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] action comedy film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', anthrax (referred to as 'Thrax') serves as the main [[antagonist]]; he is voiced by [[Laurence Fishburne]].

Anthrax is especially rare in dogs and cats, as is evidenced by a single reported case in the United States in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0110/articles/011030a.htm Can Dogs Get Anthrax?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406205603/http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0110/articles/011030a.htm |date=6 April 2012}}&quot; ''Canine Nation'', 30 October 2001.

Russian researchers estimate arctic [[permafrost]] contains around 1.5&amp;nbsp;million anthrax-infected reindeer carcasses, and the spores may survive in the permafrost for 105 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevichPodolnaya2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Revich|first1=Boris A.|last2=Podolnaya|first2=Marina A.|title=Thawing of permafrost may disturb historic cattle burial grounds in East Siberia|journal=Global Health Action|volume=4|pages=8482|year=2011|issn=1654-9880|doi=10.3402/gha.v4i0.8482|pmc=3222928|pmid=22114567}}&lt;/ref&gt; A risk exists that [[global warming in the Arctic]] can thaw the permafrost, releasing anthrax spores in the carcasses.

'''Anthrax''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from New York City, formed in 1981 by rhythm guitarist [[Scott Ian]] and bassist Dan Lilker. The group is considered one of the leaders of the [[thrash metal]] scene from the 1980s and is part of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the genre, along with [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Slayer]]. They were also one of the first thrash metal bands (along with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and [[Nuclear Assault]]) to emerge from the East Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;loudersound&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-z-of-anthrax|title=The A-Z of Anthrax|publisher=loudersound.com|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has released 11 studio albums, several other albums, and 26 singles, including collaborating on [[Bring the Noise|a single]] with American [[hip hop]] group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], Anthrax sold 2.5&amp;nbsp;million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of 10 million. Four of the band's studio albums have also achieved gold certifications by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], including their third full-length record ''[[Among the Living]]'' (1987), which cemented Anthrax's reputation as one of the most successful thrash metal bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=ANTHRAX&amp;ti=&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold &amp; Platinum - RIAA|publisher=riaa.com|accessdate=September 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/anthrax-among-the-living-1987-115448/ |title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time: Anthrax, 'Among the Living' (1987) |last=Considine |first=J.

Anthrax's lineup has changed numerous times over their career, leaving Ian as the only constant member of the band. The band has had a revolving cast of singers and lead guitarists, including [[Neil Turbin]], [[John Bush (musician)|John Bush]], [[Dan Spitz]] and [[Rob Caggiano]]. Since 2013, the band has consisted of Ian, drummer [[Charlie Benante]], bassist [[Frank Bello]], vocalist [[Joey Belladonna]] and lead guitarist [[Jonathan Donais]]. Ian and Benante (who replaced one-time drummer [[Greg D'Angelo]] in 1983) are the only two members to appear on every album, while Bello has been a member of Anthrax since 1984, replacing original bassist [[Dan Lilker]]. After two stints in Anthrax, from 1984 to 1992 and again from 2005 to 2007, Belladonna returned to the band in 2010.

==History==

===Formation (1981–1982)===
[[File:0701 Anthrax Logo LR.jpeg|thumb|alt=Stylized &quot;Anthrax&quot; in black on white|Anthrax logo used on all albums except ''[[Stomp 442]]'']]

Anthrax was formed in [[Queens]], New York City, on July 18, 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 685 - Scott Ian|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_685_-_scott_ian|website=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by guitarists [[Scott Ian]] and [[Dan Lilker]]. The band was named after the disease [[anthrax|of the same name]] which Ian saw in a biology textbook, chosen because it sounded &quot;sufficiently evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Anthrax's Scott Ian Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?'|url=http://loudwire.com/anthrax-scott-ian-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilker originally intended for Scott Setari to play bass in the band, during their early phases as a cover band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= NYHC Chronicles Live |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PFA9DYVJ34|series= NYHC Chronicles |access-date= 14 May 2020 |date=13 May 2020 |number=17 |minutes=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax's initial line-up was completed by singer [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]], drummer Dave Weiss and bassist Paul Kahn. Kahn was briefly replaced by bassist Kenny Kushner before Lilker took over on bass and Greg Walls joined as lead guitarist. Weiss was then replaced early on by [[Greg D'Angelo]], who was recommended to the band by Greg Walls. Scott Ian's younger brother Jason Rosenfeld was a temporary vocalist until Ian's former schoolmate [[Neil Turbin]] joined the band in late August 1982. The band recorded its first demo tape during this time.

===Neil Turbin era and debut album (1982–1984)===
[[file:Anthrax1983.jpg|thumb|left|Anthrax in 1983]]
The band's first performance with Neil Turbin was at Great Gildersleeves, a New York club, in September 1982. This line-up played regularly in the New York-New Jersey area over the next several months. Anthrax were also on the same bill as the up-and-coming [[Metallica]] for several shows in the spring of 1983. Guitarist Greg Walls left Anthrax that summer and was replaced by Bob Berry, who was recommended to Turbin by [[Rhett Forrester]] of [[Riot (band)|Riot]]. Berry was in turn soon replaced by [[Dan Spitz]], who was previously a member of the New Jersey thrash band [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]]. A second demo was recorded soon after.

Drummer [[Charlie Benante]] replaced D'Angelo (later of [[White Lion]]) in September 1983 after a several-month courtship by Ian. By this time, Ian and Lilker had befriended New Jersey record store owner [[Jon Zazula]], to whom they had given their demo tapes to critique. Zazula's new record label [[Megaforce Records]] had recently released Metallica's debut album ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' to great success. In late 1983, Zazula agreed to sign Anthrax and the band recorded the &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; single, which was produced by [[Ross the Boss]] of [[Manowar]]. The B-side was the song &quot;Howling Furies&quot; which was taken from a previous demo with Greg D'Angelo on drums (his only Anthrax recording).

Anthrax released their debut album ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'' in January 1984. However, tensions were building between Lilker and the rest of the band for various reasons, eventually leading to the band firing Lilker. He would soon form the band [[Nuclear Assault]] with former Anthrax roadie John Connelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Pasbani|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/oh/former-anthrax-vocalist-neil-turbin-claims-he-was-once-asked-to-be-the-frontman-of-metallica|title=Former Anthrax Vocalist Neil Turbin Claims He Was Once Asked to be the Frontman of Metallica|work=Metal Injection|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilker was replaced by Benante's nephew and roadie [[Frank Bello]]. The band then went on a successful US tour opening for [[Raven (British band)|Raven]] and others to support ''Fistful of Metal''.

In August 1984, Neil Turbin and Anthrax went their separate ways after long standing personal issues. In his book ''Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal'', music journalist [[Eddie Trunk]] admits pressuring [[Jon Zazula]], Scott Ian and Anthrax into firing Turbin because of his personal taste in vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trunk|first=Eddie|author-link=Eddie Trunk|title=Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal|chapter=Anthrax|page=240|publisher=[[Abrams Books]]|date=August 30, 2011|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Matt Fallon]] was briefly hired in late 1984, but he and the band soon parted ways.  The remaining members decided to play live shows as a four-piece billed as &quot;The Diseased&quot; with Scott Ian on vocals, performing [[hardcore punk]] covers until a permanent singer could be found.

===Initial Joey Belladonna era (1984–1992)===
[[File:Anthrax, Joey Belladonna at Wacken Open Air 2013.jpg|thumb|170px|alt=Smiling, casually-dressed singer with long, black hair onstage|Joey Belladonna contributed vocals to four studio albums during his first period with Anthrax.]]

In 1985, [[Joey Belladonna]] was chosen as the new vocalist. The ''[[Armed and Dangerous (EP)|Armed and Dangerous]]'' EP marked Belladonna's recording debut even though it featured two live tracks from 1984 and the two songs from the &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; single that all had Neil Turbin performing on them.

Anthrax's second album ''[[Spreading the Disease]]'' was released in October 1985. With left over studio time from the sessions for the album Ian, Benante and former bandmate Dan Lilker collaborated with vocalist [[Billy Milano]] and formed the side project [[Stormtroopers of Death]] and recorded the album ''[[Speak English or Die]]'' in three days, which was released in December 1985.

The US tour to support ''Spreading the Disease'' opening for [[Black Sabbath]] was cancelled after four dates due to Sabbath singer [[Glenn Hughes (English singer)|Glenn Hughes]]' voice problems. In April 1986 Anthrax attempted its first tour of Europe beginning in Bochum, Germany supported by [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and [[Agent Steel]]. The tour included a show near Chernobyl, Ukraine immediately after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loudwire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Hartmann|url=http://loudwire.com/rob-caggiano-plays-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|title=Rob Caggiano Plays Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=July 9, 2014|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Anthrax toured Europe with Metallica. The tour began on September 10 at [[St David's Hall]] and ended on September 26 in Solnahallen, Sweden. The Swedish show was Anthrax's last performance before the bus accident the following day which killed Metallica bassist [[Cliff Burton]].

The band's third studio album ''[[Among the Living]]'' was released in March 1987. It showcased the band's humorous, experimental side and began a lyrical trend focusing on movies, comic books and [[Stephen King]] novels. The album was dedicated to Cliff Burton's memory. &quot;I Am the Law&quot; was issued as a single backed with &quot;I'm the Man&quot;, a [[rap music|rap]]-metal hybrid.&lt;ref name=BW_Heavy_Metal/&gt; Anthrax further indulged its appreciation for rap by appearing on the title track of [[U.T.F.O.]]'s album, ''Lethal''. The band toured Europe with Metallica and [[Metal Church]], and the United States and Europe with [[Testament (band)|Testament]] to promote ''Among the Living''.

Anthrax returned in 1988 with their fourth album ''[[State of Euphoria]]''. The single &quot;[[Antisocial (Trust song)|Antisocial]]&quot;, originally by French heavy-metal band [[Trust (French band)|Trust]], became an MTV staple as part of the rotation on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''. The band expanded its horizons by touring the US with the [[funk metal]] band [[Living Colour]] and embarking on the [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Helloween]]. In 1989, MTV sponsored a contest in which the winner had her home trashed by the band. This would later inspire Anthrax's 1992 appearance on the television series ''[[Married... with Children]]'', in which the Bundys win a similar TV contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loudwire&quot;/&gt;

In 1990 Anthrax released the more serious ''[[Persistence of Time]]'', which surpassed ''State of Euphoria''{{'}}s success. The album was darker, more technical and more progressive than the band's previous work, striking a chord with metal fans wary of Anthrax's &quot;silly&quot; side. The most successful single from the album was a cover of [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]'s &quot;Got the Time&quot;, which Jackson said he enjoyed. In 1991, Anthrax collaborated with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] on a version of &quot;[[Bring the Noise]]&quot;. This was a hit, and a successful tour with Public Enemy followed. &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; has been a live staple for Anthrax since they first played it in concert in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bring the Noise by Anthrax Concert Statistics|website=setlist.fm|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/public-enemy-63d686a3.html?artist=7bd68e98&amp;song=Bring+the+Noise|accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compilation ''[[Attack of the Killer B's]]'' was released in 1991, and featured three tracks from their 1989 EP ''[[Penikufesin]]'', a new version of &quot;I'm the Man&quot; and a cover of &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; on which Ian did some vocals. In late 1992, singer Joey Belladonna was fired from Anthrax over creative and stylistic differences.

===Initial John Bush era (1992–2005)===

After firing Belladonna, the remaining members of Anthrax auditioned several vocalists including Mark Osegueda of [[Death Angel]] and Spike Xavier of [[Mind Over Four]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ian and Jon Weiderhorn (2014).

Da Capo Press, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Armored Saint]] vocalist [[John Bush (musician)|John Bush]] was the standout favorite and had in fact been floated as a potential replacement for Belladonna a few years earlier due to questions about his reliability stemming from drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Ian and Weiderhorn (2014), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The band left Island Records to sign with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], releasing ''[[Sound of White Noise]]'' in 1993. A change from Anthrax's earlier work, with a dark sound influenced by [[alternative rock]], ''Sound of White Noise'' received mostly-positive reviews. Critic Dave Connolley of Allmusic.com would write that Bush &quot;has a lower-register voice than Belladonna, and the result is menacing, premeditated, and sinister.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-of-white-noise-mw0000617745|title=Sound of White Noise - Anthrax - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;[[Only (Anthrax song)|Only]]&quot; was released as the album's first single. In the liner notes for ''[[Return of the Killer A's]]'', Ian said that [[James Hetfield]] told him it was a &quot;perfect song&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Anthrax's 'Sound of White Noise' Kicked Off the John Bush Era |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/anthrax-sound-of-white-noise/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |accessdate=11 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the band's eye for unlikely collaborations, classical composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] provided music for &quot;Black Lodge&quot; (a nod to ''[[Twin Peaks]]''). This album demonstrated that Anthrax had fully shed its cartoonish persona in favor of mature, thoughtful songwriting, which began with ''Persistence of Time''.

After ''Sound of White Noise'' longtime guitarist [[Dan Spitz]] left the band to become a watchmaker, leaving Anthrax a quartet for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spitz|first=Daniel|url=http://www.spitzwatch.com/bio/|title=Dan Spitz Biography|accessdate=September 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192841/http://www.spitzwatch.com/bio/|archive-date=September 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Anthrax released their seventh studio album ''[[Stomp 442]]'', on which Charlie Benante played most of the lead-guitar parts. Benante was assisted by [[Paul Crook]], who later became the band's touring lead guitarist for several years, and [[Dimebag Darrell]] of [[Pantera]]. Because Elektra did not promote the album it was less commercially successful than its predecessor, and Anthrax severed its ties with the label.

The band signed with independent label Ignition Records, releasing ''[[Volume 8: The Threat Is Real]]'' in 1998. As on ''Stomp 442'', Benante performed lead guitar parts along with Crook and Darrell. The album also features Pantera vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] making a guest vocal appearance. After the album's release the label went bankrupt, disrupting its distribution. Anthrax then signed with Beyond Records, who released the greatest-hits album ''[[Return of the Killer A's]]'' (1999), after which Beyond went out of business as well. During this period a two-vocalist tour with Belladonna and Bush was planned, but Belladonna decided not to participate at the last minute; however, on the mentioned ''Return of the Killer A's'' compilation, a cover of [[The Temptations]] song &quot;[[Ball of Confusion]]&quot; was recorded with the then-current lineup of the band (Ian/Benante/Bello/Bush/Crook), in addition to former vocalist Belladonna and former bassist Lilker. This is the only song to feature both Belladonna and Bush on co-vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Arto|last=Lehtinen|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Anthrax-Summer2003.htm|title=Anthrax Interviews with Scott Ian and John Bush|work=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite hardships and legal entanglements over album rights, Anthrax continued. In 2001, [[Rob Caggiano]] joined the band on lead guitar. During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States the band changed its website, providing information about the disease after people began searching &quot;anthrax.com&quot; on internet search engines. Amid a potential [[public relations|PR]] nightmare, Anthrax issued a press release on October 10, 2001 joking that the band's name would be changed to &quot;something more friendly, like 'Basket Full of Puppies'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthrax.com/html/ANTHRAX_PressRelease.htm |title=Anthrax: Press Release |publisher=Anthrax.com |date=November 8, 2004 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108091742/http://www.anthrax.com/html/ANTHRAX_PressRelease.htm |archive-date=November 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax dispelled any name-change rumors derived from the press release at the November 2001 [[New York Steel]] 9/11 [[benefit concert]], when they took the stage in [[Boilersuit|boiler suits]] with a different word on each one which ultimately read &quot;We're not changing our name&quot;. Bello has stated they did so after receiving support from members of the NYPD and NYFD, who believed that changing the name of the band would send the wrong message. A picture of the band in the suits is on the inner tray card of ''We've Come for You All''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loudwire&quot;/&gt;

In 2003, the band signed to [[Sanctuary Records]] and released their ninth studio album ''[[We've Come for You All]]'', praised by metal journalists as a return to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We've Come for You All - Anthrax |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weve-come-for-you-all-mw0000592708 |website=Allmusic |accessdate=10 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band then spent the summer of 2003 on tour with [[Motörhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Motörhead/Anthrax: First North American Tour Dates Announced |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mot-rhead-anthrax-first-north-american-tour-dates-announced/ |website=Blabbermouth |accessdate=10 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004 Anthrax released ''[[The Greater of Two Evils]]'', a &quot;live in the studio&quot; re-recording of the earlier work with the band's then current lineup. Bassist Frank Bello announced shortly afterwards that he was leaving the band to join [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], and was replaced by [[Fates Warning]] and Armored Saint member [[Joey Vera]].

===Reunions with Belladonna and Bush (2005–2010)===
In April 2005, Anthrax announced that the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, Dan Spitz, Joey Belladonna and Frank Bello would reform. At some shows on the following tour, they played ''Among the Living'' in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Official: Anthrax's 'Among The Living' Lineup To Reunite|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-anthrax-s-among-the-living-lineup-to-reunite/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 24, 2005|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lineup was expected to record a new album after the tour, in January 2007 Ian said that Belladonna had not agreed to a reunion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-guitarist-scott-ian-the-reunion-is-over/|title=Anthrax Guitarist Scott Ian: 'The Reunion Is Over'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 24, 2007|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bush also said he wasn't ready to re-commit to Anthrax and said he had been asked to return but had declined. Asked if he wanted to rejoin the band when Belladonna left, Bush said that he &quot;just didn't feel right to do that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/armored-saint-s-john-bush-metallica-philosophy-book-author-interviewed/|title=Armored Saint's John Bush, Metallica 'Philosophy' Book Author Interviewed|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/singer-john-bush-i-am-not-ready-to-commit-to-anthrax-again/|title=Singer John Bush: 'I Am Not Ready' To Commit To Anthrax Again|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anthrax-sonisphere-2009006.jpg|thumb|alt=Singer and guitarist onstage|Anthrax with vocalist John Bush at [[Sonisphere Festival#England|Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth]], 2009]]
In December 2007, it was announced that the band's new vocalist would be [[Dan Nelson]], formerly of Devilsize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Official: Anthrax Taps Former Devilsize Singer|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-anthrax-taps-former-devilsize-singer/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rob Caggiano would return as lead guitarist. In May 2008, Anthrax played its first show in 19 months at [[Double Door]] in Chicago.

In his monthly Food Coma column posted in December 2008, Scott Ian wrote that he had &quot;been in the studio working on the new Anthrax album&quot;, promising to be &quot;giving birth to a really pissed off, loud, fast and heavy child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott |last=Ian |url=http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23475/ |title=A Festive Feast of Awesomeness |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223125611/http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23475/ |archive-date=December 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that the album was being mixed by [[Dave Fortman]], who had worked with [[Evanescence]] and [[Slipknot (Band)|Slipknot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott |last=Ian |url=http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23687/ |title=Scott Ian's Food Coma: Uncorking Wine and Led Zep |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130549/http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23687/ |archive-date=May 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, Anthrax began a brief tour opening for [[Iron Maiden]] in South America. In July, band manager Izvor Zivkovic confirmed the departure of Dan Nelson due to illness. Nelson denied this, saying that he was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-anthrax-singer-dan-nelson-i-was-ready-willing-and-able-to-do-my-job/|title=Former Anthrax Singer Dan Nelson: 'I Was Ready, Willing And Able To Do My Job'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent performances were canceled except the August UK Sonisphere Festival, which featured John Bush on vocals. Fan response after his performance led to a &quot;Bring Back Bush&quot; campaign, which was endorsed by Ian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Terry |last=Bezer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/scott-ian-endorses-bring-back-bush-campaign/ |title=Scott Ian Endorses 'Bring Back Bush' Campaign |work=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=August 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809144113/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/scott-ian-endorses-bring-back-bush-campaign/ |archive-date=August 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Benante said that Bush had rejoined the band. In February 2010, Anthrax performed five shows as part of [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]] in Australia. After the Australian shows, Bush said the band intended to re-record the vocals of several tracks from the upcoming album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Ogle|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/john-bush-says-timing-is-right-for-anthrax-s-reunion-with-joey-belladonna/|title=John Bush Says 'Timing Is Right' For Anthrax's Reunion With Joey Belladonna|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 19, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Anthrax at Wacken Open Air 2013 05.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Anthrax during [[Wacken Open Air]] 2013]]
In late 2009, Anthrax confirmed their participation in several &quot;Big Four&quot; concerts with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer as part of the 2010 [[Sonisphere Festival]] dates in Europe. John Bush decided that he did not want to commit to the band full-time, and left Anthrax for the second time. Joey Belladonna returned to the band in early 2010 for the Sonisphere dates as well as committing to record a new studio album with the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-joey-belladonna-rejoins-anthrax-for-tour-studio-album/|title=It's Official: Joey Belladonna Rejoins Anthrax For Tour, Studio Album|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 10, 2010|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer performed on the same bill for the first time ever at seven [[Sonisphere Festival|Sonisphere]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallica-slayer-megadeth-anthrax-the-first-big-four-photo/|title=Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax: The First 'Big Four' Photo|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 15, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sofia]], Bulgaria show was broadcast in cinemas and later [[The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria|released on DVD and Blu-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andre|last=Paine|title=Metallica Heading To Cinemas|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957831/metallica-heading-to-cinemas|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bands would also play a few shows in the U.S. the following year, including a concert at [[Yankee Stadium]] in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratliff |first1=Ben |title=Metallica Earns Its Top Billing of the Big Four |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/arts/music/music-review-big-four-with-anthrax-megadeth-slayer-and-metallica.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=10 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

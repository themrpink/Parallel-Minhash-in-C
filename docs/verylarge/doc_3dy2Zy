{{Main|Tributaries of the River Thames}}
The Thames River Basin District, including the Medway catchment, covers an area of {{convert|6229|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Environment Agency&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/33130.aspx |title=Environment Agency More about the Thames River Basin District |author=The Environment Agency |date=5 October 2011 |work=web page |publisher=The Environment Agency |access-date=6 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908011951/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/33130.aspx |archive-date=8 September 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The river basin includes both rural and heavily urbanised areas in the east and northern parts while the western parts of the catchment are predominantly rural. The area is among the driest in the United Kingdom. Water resources consist of [[groundwater]] from aquifers and water taken from the Thames and its tributaries, much of it stored in large [[Reservoir#Bank-side reservoir|bank-side reservoirs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Environment Agency&quot;/&gt;

The Thames itself provides two-thirds of London's drinking water while groundwater supplies about 40 percent of public water supplies in the total catchment area. Groundwater is an important water source, especially in the drier months, so maintaining its quality and quantity is extremely important. Groundwater is vulnerable to surface pollution, especially in highly urbanised areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Environment Agency&quot; /&gt;

This is the usual [[tidal limit]]; however, high spring tides can raise the head water level in the reach above Teddington and can occasionally reverse the river flow for a short time. In these circumstances, tidal effects can be observed upstream to the next lock beside [[Molesey Lock|Molesey weir]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CEH&quot;/&gt; which is visible from the towpath and [[Hampton Court Bridge|bridge]] beside [[Hampton Court Palace]]. Before Teddington Lock was built in 1810–12, the river was tidal at peak spring tides as far as [[Staines upon Thames]].

In descending order, non-related tributaries of the non-tidal Thames, with river status, are the [[River Churn|Churn]], [[River Leach|Leach]], [[River Cole, Wiltshire|Cole]], [[River Ray, Wiltshire|Ray]], [[River Coln|Coln]], [[River Windrush|Windrush]], [[River Evenlode|Evenlode]], [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]], [[River Ock|Ock]], [[River Thame|Thame]], [[River Pang|Pang]], [[River Kennet|Kennet]], [[River Loddon|Loddon]], [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]], [[River Wey|Wey]] and [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]]. In addition, there are occasional backwaters and artificial cuts that form islands, [[distributary|distributaries]] (most numerous in the case of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]]), and man-made distributaries such as the [[Longford River]]. Three canals intersect this stretch: the [[Oxford Canal]], [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] and [[Wey Navigation]].

Its longest artificial secondary channel (cut), the [[Jubilee River]], was built between Maidenhead and Windsor for flood relief and completed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/seengland/thamesjubilee.htm |title=UK Rivers Guide Book Guide to the River Thames – Jubilee River |publisher=Ukriversguidebook.co.uk |date=23 January 2011 |access-date=2 April 2012 |archive-date=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503110907/http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/seengland/thamesjubilee.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/jubileerivermap_1200567.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152507/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/jubileerivermap_1200567.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2007 |title=Environment Agency – A map indicating the location and route of the Jubilee River |date=30 September 2007 |access-date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-tidal section of the river is managed by the [[Environment Agency]], which is responsible for managing the flow of water to help prevent and mitigate flooding, and providing for navigation: the volume and speed of water downstream is managed by adjusting the sluices at each of the weirs and, at peak high water, levels are generally dissipated over preferred flood plains adjacent to the river. Occasionally, flooding of inhabited areas is unavoidable and the agency issues flood warnings. Due to stiff penalties applicable on the non-tidal river, which is a drinking water source before treatment, [[sanitary sewer overflow]] from the many [[sewage treatment plant]]s covering the upper Thames basin should be rare in the non-tidal Thames.  However, storm sewage overflows are  still common in almost all the main tributaries of the thames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/water-firms-raw-sewage-england-rivers|title=Exclusive: water firms discharged raw sewage into England's rivers 200,000 times in 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 August 2020|date=1 July 2020|archive-date=27 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085619/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/water-firms-raw-sewage-england-rivers|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a6dd42e3bc264fc28134c64c00db4a5b&amp;extent=146436.9576%2C27590.8012%2C854242.0922%2C563326.0668%2C27700|publisher=The Rivers TRust|access-date=4 August 2020|title=Is my river fit to play in?}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite claims by Thames Water to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/tw/common/downloads/about%20us%20-%20corporate%20responsibility/annual-performance-report-2011-12.pdf|title=Report of the designated sewerage company for the entire Thames Basin and major supplier of London's water supply: Thames Water|access-date=20 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131021304/http://www.thameswater.co.uk/tw/common/downloads/about%20us%20-%20corporate%20responsibility/annual-performance-report-2011-12.pdf|archive-date=31 January 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The tidal section ====
{{Main|Tideway}}

[[File:Thames tide.jpg|thumb|Waterstand of Thames at low tide (left) and high tide (right) in comparison at Blackfriars Bridge in London]]
Below Teddington Lock (about {{convert|55|mi|km|0|disp=or}} upstream of the Thames Estuary), the river is subject to [[tide|tidal activity]] from the [[North Sea]]. Before the lock was installed, the river was tidal as far as Staines, about {{convert|16|mi|km}} upstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitthames.co.uk/text/106/free_fishing.html |title=River Thames Free Fishing |publisher=River Thames Alliance |access-date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; London, capital of [[Roman Britain]], was established on two hills, now known as [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Ludgate Hill]]. These provided a firm base for a trading centre at the lowest possible point on the Thames.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd ''London:The Biography'' Vintage 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A river crossing was built at the site of [[London Bridge]]. London Bridge is now used as the basis for published tide tables giving the times of [[tide|high tide]]. High tide reaches Putney about 30 minutes later than London Bridge, and Teddington about an hour later. The [[tidal reach|tidal stretch]] of the river is known as &quot;the [[Tideway]]&quot;. Tide tables are published by the [[Port of London Authority]] and are available online. Times of high and low tides are also posted on Twitter.

The principal [[tributaries of the River Thames]] on the Tideway include the rivers [[River Brent|Brent]], [[River Wandle|Wandle]], [[River Effra|Effra]], [[River Westbourne|Westbourne]], [[River Fleet|Fleet]], [[River Ravensbourne|Ravensbourne]] (the final part of which is called [[Deptford Creek]]), [[River Lea|Lea]], [[River Roding|Roding]], [[River Darent|Darent]] and [[River Ingrebourne|Ingrebourne]]. At London, the water is slightly [[brackish water|brackish]] with sea salt, being a mix of sea and fresh water.

This part of the river is managed by the [[Port of London Authority]]. The flood threat here comes from high tides and strong winds from the North Sea, and the Thames Barrier was built in the 1980s to protect London from this risk.

[[The Nore]] is the [[sandbank]]  that marks the mouth of the [[Thames Estuary]],  where the outflow from the Thames meets the [[North Sea]]. It is roughly halfway between [[River Roach#The tidal river|Havengore Creek]] in Essex and Warden Point on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in Kent. Until 1964 it marked the seaward limit of the Port of London Authority. As the sandbank was a major hazard for shipping coming in and out of London, in 1732 it received the world's first [[lightvessel|lightship]]. This became a major landmark, and was used as an assembly point for shipping. Today it is marked by Sea Reach No. 1 Buoy.&lt;ref name=PortCities&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/nav.001008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229125347/http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/nav.001008|url-status=dead|title=PortCities London|archive-date=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islands ===
{{Main|Islands in the River Thames}}

[[File:Aerial view of London City Airport 2007.jpg|thumb|right| [[London City Airport]] is on the site of a dock]]

The River Thames contains over 80 islands ranging from the large estuarial marshlands of the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and [[Canvey Island]] to small tree-covered islets like [[Rose Isle]] in Oxfordshire and [[Headpile Eyot]] in Berkshire. They are found all the way from the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in Kent to [[Fiddler's Island]] in Oxfordshire. Some of the largest inland islands, for example [[Formosa Island]] near Cookham and [[Andersey Island]] at Abingdon, were created naturally when the course of the river divided into separate streams.

In the Oxford area the river splits into several streams across the [[floodplain]] ([[Seacourt Stream]], [[Castle Mill Stream]], [[Bulstake Stream]] and others), creating several islands ([[Fiddler's Island]], [[Osney]] and others). [[Desborough Island]], [[Ham Island]] at Old Windsor and [[Penton Hook Island]] were artificially created by lock cuts and navigation channels. [[Chiswick Eyot]] is a landmark on the Boat Race course, while [[Glover's Island]] forms the centre of a view from [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]].

Islands of historical interest include [[Magna Carta Island]] at [[Runnymede]], [[Fry's Island]] at Reading, and [[Pharaoh's Island, River Thames|Pharaoh's Island]] near Shepperton. In more recent times [[Platts Eyot]] at [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] was the place where [[Motor Torpedo Boats]] (MTB)s were built, [[Tagg's Island]] near Molesey was associated with the impresario [[Fred Karno]] and [[Eel Pie Island]] at Twickenham was the birthplace of the South East's [[R&amp;B]] music scene.

[[Westminster Abbey]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]] (commonly known today as the [[Houses of Parliament]]) were built on [[Thorney Island (Westminster)|Thorney Island]], which used to be an [[eyot]].

[[File:Europe20000ya.png|thumb|European [[Last Glacial Maximum|LGM]] refuges, 20,000 years ago. The Thames was a minor river that joined the [[Rhine]], in the southern [[North Sea basin]] at this time.&lt;br/&gt;{{legend|#c54b00|[[w:Solutrean|Solutrean]] and Proto Solutrean Cultures}}{{legend|#ca00b0|Epi [[w:Gravettian|Gravettian]] Culture}}]]

Researchers have identified the River Thames as a discrete drainage line flowing as early as 58&amp;nbsp;million years ago, in the [[Thanetian]] stage of the late [[Palaeocene]] epoch.&lt;ref name=terriv&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/ |title= History of the major rivers of southern Britain during the Tertiary |publisher= Quaternary Palaeoenvironments Group |year= 2006 |access-date= 28 November 2007 |archive-date= 11 October 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112249/http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/tertiaryrivers/ |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until around 500,000 years ago, the Thames flowed on its existing course through what is now [[Oxfordshire]], before turning to the north-east through [[Hertfordshire]] and [[East Anglia]] and reaching the [[North Sea]] near present-day [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= The early Ice Age |url= http://www.geoessex.org.uk/the_early_ice_age.html |website= www.geoessex.org.uk |access-date= 7 February 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160119080111/http://geoessex.org.uk/the_early_ice_age.html |archive-date= 19 January 2016 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the river-system headwaters lay in the English [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and may, at times, have received drainage from the [[Berwyn Mountains]] in [[North Wales]]. Brooks and rivers like the [[River Brent]], [[Colne Brook]] and [[Bollo Brook]] either flowed into the then River Thames or went out to sea on the course of the present-day River Thames.

About 450,000 years ago, in the most extreme [[Ice Age]] of the [[Pleistocene]], the [[Anglian (stage)|Anglian]], the furthest southern extent of the ice sheet reached [[Hornchurch]] in east London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/geology3.htm|title= Essex Wildlife Trust, The Geology of Essex|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021073553/http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/geology3.htm|archive-date= 21 October 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dammed the river in [[Hertfordshire]], resulting in the formation of large ice lakes, which eventually burst their banks and caused the river to  divert onto its present course through the area of present-day London. Repeated advances of the ice sheet progressively pushed the channel southwards to form the [[St Albans]] depression.&lt;ref name=nwriv/&gt;

This created a new river-course through [[Berkshire]] and on into London, after which the river rejoined its original course in southern [[Essex]], near the present [[River Blackwater (Essex)|River Blackwater]] estuary. Here it entered a substantial freshwater lake in the southern North Sea basin, south of what is called [[Doggerland]]. The overspill of this lake caused the formation of the [[Channel River]] and later the [[Strait of Dover|Dover Strait]] gap between present-day [[Great Britain|Britain]] and France. Subsequent development led to the continuation of the course that the river follows at the present day.&lt;ref name=nwriv /&gt;

Most of the [[bedrock]] of the [[Aylesbury Vale|Vale of Aylesbury]] comprises [[clay]] and [[chalk]] that  formed at the end of the [[ice age]] and at one time was under the [[Ancestral Thames|Proto-Thames]]. At this time the vast underground reserves of water formed that make the [[water table]] higher than average in the Vale of Aylesbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buckingham Surface Water Management Plan |url=https://old.buckscc.gov.uk/media/2275771/Buckingham-phase1-swmp.pdf |publisher=Buckinghamshire County Council |access-date=27 August 2020 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085728/https://old.buckscc.gov.uk/media/2275771/Buckingham-phase1-swmp.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last advance of the [[Scandinavian ice sheet|Scandinavian ice-sheet]] to have reached this far south covered much of north-west [[Middlesex]] and finally forced the Proto-Thames to take roughly its present course. At the height of the last [[ice age]], around 20,000 BC, Britain was connected to mainland Europe by a large expanse of land known as [[Doggerland]] in the southern [[North Sea Basin]]. At this time, the Thames' course did not continue to Doggerland but flowed southwards from the eastern Essex coast where it met the waters of the proto-[[River Rhine|Rhine]], [[River Meuse|-Meuse]] and [[River Scheldt|-Scheldt]]&lt;ref name=nwriv&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/nweurorivers/ |title= History of the northwest European rivers during the past three million years |publisher= Quaternary Palaeoenvironments Group |year= 2007 |access-date= 28 November 2007 |archive-date= 2 November 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102213709/http://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/nweurorivers/ |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; flowing from what are now the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. These rivers formed a single river – the [[Channel River]] (''Fleuve Manche'') – that passed through the Dover Strait and drained into the Atlantic Ocean in the western [[English Channel]].

The ice sheet, which stopped around present-day [[Finchley]], deposited [[boulder clay]] to form [[Dollis Hill]] and Hanger Hill. Its torrent of [[meltwater]] gushed through the [[Finchley Gap]] and south towards the new course of the Thames, and proceeded to carve out the [[River Brent|Brent Valley]] in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mylondon.news/news/local-news/retro-a-river-worth-preserving-5989210 |title= Retro: A river worth preserving |publisher= Ealing Gazette |date= 18 February 2011 |access-date= 27 August 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the valley sides there can be seen other terraces of [[brickearth]], laid over and sometimes interlayered with the clays.

These deposits were brought in by the winds during the [[periglacial]] periods, suggesting that wide, flat marshes were then part of the landscape, which the new river Brent proceeded to cut down. The steepness of the valley sides indicates very much lower [[mean sea level]]s caused by the glaciation locking up so much water upon the land masses, thus causing the river water to flow rapidly seaward and so erode its bed quickly downwards.

The original land surface was around {{convert|350|to|400|ft|m|abbr= off}} above the current sea-level. The surface had sandy deposits from an ancient sea, laid over sedimentary clay (this is the blue [[London Clay]]). All the erosion down from this higher land surface, and the sorting action by these changes of water flow and direction, formed what is known as the Thames [[Fluvial terrace|River Gravel Terraces]].

Since Roman times and perhaps earlier, the [[isostasy|isostatic]] rebound from the weight of previous ice sheets, and its interplay with the [[eustatic]] change in sea level, have resulted in the old valley of the River Brent, together with that of the Thames, silting up again. Thus, along much of the Brent's present-day course, one can make out the [[water-meadow]]s of rich alluvium, which is augmented by frequent floods.

==== Conversion of marshland ====
After the river took its present-day course, many of the banks of the [[Thames Estuary]] and the [[Thames Valley]] in London were partly covered in [[marshland]], as was the adjoining [[Lower Lea Valley]]. Streams and rivers like the [[River Lea]], [[Tyburn Brook]] and [[Bollo Brook]] drained into the river, while some islands, e.g. [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]], formed over the ages. The northern tip of the ancient parish of [[Lambeth (parish)|Lambeth]], for example, was marshland known as ''Lambeth Marshe'', but it was drained in the 18th century; the street name [[Lower Marsh]] preserves a memory.&lt;ref name=ADMills&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DSIOAQAAMAAJ |title= Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names |author= Anthony David Mills |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-19-280106-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[East End of London]], also known simply as the '''East End''', was the area of London east of the medieval walled [[City of London]] and north of the River Thames, although it is not defined by universally accepted formal boundaries; the [[River Lea]] can be considered another boundary.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}} p. 582 &quot;'''East End''' the part of London east of the [[City of London|City]] as far as the River Lea, including the Docklands&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the local riverside was also marshland. The land was drained and became farmland; it was built on after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Use of the term &quot;East End&quot; in a pejorative sense began in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=ADMills /&gt;

[[Canvey Island]] in southern Essex (area {{convert|18.45|km2|abbr= on|disp= comma}}; population 40,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Canvey Island |url=https://canveyisland-tc.gov.uk/visitor-information/history-of-canvey/ |publisher=Canvey Island Town Council |access-date=27 August 2020 |archive-date=27 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827085619/https://canveyisland-tc.gov.uk/visitor-information/history-of-canvey/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was once marshy, but is now a fully reclaimed island in the Thames estuary, separated from the mainland of south [[Essex]] by a network of creeks. Lying below sea level, it is prone to flooding at exceptional tides, but has nevertheless been inhabited since Roman times.

=== Wildlife ===
[[File:Swan Upping.jpg|thumb|Swan Upping – [[Thames skiff|skiffs]] surround the swans]]

Various species of birds feed off the river or nest on it, some being found both at sea and inland. These include [[great cormorant|cormorant]], [[black-headed gull]] and [[European herring gull|herring gull]]. The [[mute swan]] is a familiar sight on the river but the escaped [[black swan]] is more rare. The annual ceremony of [[Swan Upping]] is an old tradition of counting stocks.

Non-native geese that can be seen include [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], [[Egyptian goose|Egyptian geese]] and [[bar-headed goose|bar-headed geese]], and ducks include the familiar native [[mallard]], plus introduced [[Mandarin duck]] and [[wood duck]]. Other water birds to be found on the Thames include the [[great crested grebe]], [[Eurasian coot|coot]], [[moorhen]], [[grey heron|heron]] and [[European kingfisher|kingfisher]]. Many types of British birds also live alongside the river, although they are not specific to the river habitat.

The Thames contains both sea water and fresh water, thus providing support for seawater and freshwater fish. However, many populations of fish are at risk and are being killed in tens of thousands because of pollutants leaking into the river from human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, ''Thames: The Biography''. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlantic Salmon|Salmon]], which inhabit both environments, have been reintroduced and a succession of [[fish ladder]]s have been built into [[weir]]s to enable them to travel upstream.

On 5 August 1993, the largest non-tidal salmon in recorded history was caught close to [[Boulters Lock]] in [[Maidenhead]]. The specimen weighed {{convert|14+1/2|lb|kg}} and measured {{convert|22|in|cm}} in length. The [[European eel|eel]] is particularly associated with the Thames and there were formerly many eel traps. Freshwater fish of the Thames and its tributaries include [[brown trout]], [[European chub|chub]], [[common dace|dace]], [[common roach|roach]], [[barbel (fish species)|barbel]], [[European perch|perch]], [[northern pike|pike]], [[common bleak|bleak]] and [[flounder]].

Aquatic mammals are also known to inhabit the Thames. The population of [[grey seal|grey]] and [[harbour seal]]s numbers up to 700 in the Thames Estuary.

On 20 January 2006, a {{convert|16-18|ft|m|abbr=on}} northern [[bottle-nosed whale]] was seen in the Thames as far upstream as Chelsea. This was extremely unusual: this whale is generally found in deep sea waters. Crowds gathered along the riverbanks to witness the spectacle but there was soon concern, as the animal came within yards of the banks, almost beaching, and crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding. About 12 hours later, the whale is believed to have been seen again near [[Greenwich]], possibly heading back to sea. A rescue attempt lasted several hours, but the whale died on a barge.

== Human history ==

The River Thames has played several roles in human history: as an economic resource, a maritime route, a boundary, a fresh water source, a source of food and more recently a leisure facility. In 1929, [[John Burns]], one-time MP for Battersea, responded to an American's unfavourable comparison of the Thames with the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] by coining the expression &quot;The Thames is liquid history&quot;.

There is evidence of human habitation living off the river along its length dating back to [[Neolithic]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Needham |year=1985 |title=Neolithic And Bronze Age Settlement on the Buried Floodplains of Runnymede |journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.1985.tb00237.x |pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum]] has a decorated bowl (3300–2700 BC), found in the river at [[Hedsor]], Buckinghamshire, and a considerable amount of material was discovered during the excavations of [[Dorney Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamdin-Whymark |first=H. |year=2001 |title=Neolithic activity on the floodplain of the river Thames at Dorney |journal=Lithics |volume=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Bronze Age]] sites and artefacts have been discovered along the banks of the river including settlements at [[Lechlade]], [[Cookham]] and [[Sunbury-on-Thames]].&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history1&quot;&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22094 The Physique of Middlesex], A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 1: Physique, Archaeology, Domesday, Ecclesiastical Organisation, The Jews, Religious Houses, Education of Working Classes to 1870, Private Education from Sixteenth Century (1969), pp. 1–10.

So extensive have the changes to this landscape been that what little evidence there is of man's presence before the ice came has inevitably shown signs of transportation here by water and reveals nothing specifically local. Likewise, later evidence of occupation, even since the arrival of the Romans, may lie next to the original banks of the Brent but have been buried under centuries of silt.&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history1&quot;/&gt;

=== Roman Britain ===
Some of the earliest written references to the Thames ({{lang-la|[[#Etymology|Tamesis]]}}) occur in [[Julius Caesar]]'s account of his second expedition to Britain in 54 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Julius Caesar ''De Bello Gallico'', Book 5, §§&amp;nbsp;11, 18&lt;/ref&gt; when the Thames presented a major obstacle and he encountered the [[Iron Age]] [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes the [[Catuvellauni]] and the [[Atrebates]] along the river. The confluence of the Thames and Cherwell was the site of early settlements and the River Cherwell marked the boundary between the [[Dobunni]] tribe to the west and the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe to the east (these were pre-Roman [[Celt]]ic tribes). In the late 1980s a large [[Romano-British]] settlement was excavated on the edge of the village of [[Ashton Keynes]] in Wiltshire.

In {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;43, under the [[Claudius|Emperor&amp;nbsp;Claudius]], the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Romans occupied England]] and, recognising the river's strategic and economic importance, built fortifications along the Thames valley including [[Durnovaria|a major camp]] at [[Dorchester, Oxfordshire|Dorchester]]. [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Ludgate Hill]] provided a defensible site near a point on the river both deep enough for the era's ships and narrow enough to be bridged; [[Londinium]] (London) grew up around the [[River Walbrook|Walbrook]] on the north bank around the year 47. [[Boudica]]'s [[Iceni]] razed the settlement in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;60 or 61 but it was soon rebuilt and, following the completion of its bridge, it grew to become the provincial capital of the island.

The next Roman bridges upstream were at [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]] on the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)|Devil's Highway]] between Londinium and [[Calleva Atrebatum|Calleva]] ([[Silchester]]). Boats could be swept up to it on the rising tide with no need for wind or muscle power.

=== Middle Ages ===
A Romano-British settlement grew up north of the confluence, partly because the site was naturally protected from attack on the east side by the [[River Cherwell]] and on the west by the River Thames. This settlement dominated the pottery trade in what is now central southern England, and pottery was distributed by boats on the Thames and its tributaries.

Competition for the use of the river created the centuries-old conflict between those who wanted to dam the river to build millraces and fish traps and those who wanted to travel and carry goods on it. Economic prosperity and the foundation of wealthy monasteries by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] attracted unwelcome visitors and by around AD 870 the [[Vikings]] were sweeping up the Thames on the tide and creating havoc as in their destruction of [[Chertsey Abbey]].

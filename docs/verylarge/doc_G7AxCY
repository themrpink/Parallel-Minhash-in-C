'''Uploading''' refers to ''transmitting'' [[Data (computing)|data]] from one [[Computer|computer system]] to another through means of a [[Computer network|network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Uploading? Definition from WhatIs.com|url=https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/uploading|website=WhatIs.com|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods of uploading include: uploading via [[Web browser|web browsers]], [[FTP]] [[Client-server model|client]]s, and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] ([[Secure copy|SCP]]/[[SSH File Transfer Protocol|SFTP]]). Uploading can be used in the context of (potentially many) [[Client_(computing)|clients]] that send files to a central [[Server_(computing)|server]]. While uploading can also be defined in the context of sending [[Computer file|files]] between [[Distributed computing|distributed]] clients, such as with a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file-sharing [[Communication protocol|protocol]] like [[BitTorrent]], the term [[file sharing]] is more often used in this case. Moving files within a computer system, as opposed to over a network, is called [[file copying]]. 

Uploading directly contrasts with [[download]]ing, where data is ''received'' over a network. In the case of users uploading files over the [[internet]], uploading is often slower than downloading as many [[Internet service provider|internet service providers]] (ISPs) offer [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|asymmetric connections]], which offer more network [[Bandwidth_(computing)|bandwidth]] for downloading than uploading. 

==Definition==
To transfer something (such as data or files), from a computer or other digital device to the [[Computer memory|memory]] of another device (such as a larger or remote computer) especially via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Upload|website=Merriam Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/upload|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Remote [[file sharing]] first came into fruition in January 1978, when [[Ward Christensen]] and [[Randy Suess]], who were members of the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists' Exchange (CACHE), created the [[CBBS|Computerized Bulletin Board System]] (CBBS). This used an early file transfer protocol (MODEM, later [[XMODEM]]) to send [[Binary file|binary files]] via a hardware [[modem]], accessible by another modem via a [[telephone number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Birth of the BBS. By Ward and Randy (1989)|url= https://www.chinet.com/html/cbbs.php|accessdate=11 June 2020|author=Christensen, Suess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, new protocols such as [[Kermit_(protocol)|Kermit]] were released,&lt;ref name=&quot;dacruz19860320&quot;&gt;{{cite mailing list|url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/e/mail.86a|title=Re: Printable Encodings for Binary Files|publisher=Kermit Project, Columbia University|mailinglist=Info-Kermit Digest|date=1986-03-20|accessdate=11 June 2020|author=da Cruz, Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) was standardized 1985 ({{IETF RFC|959}}). FTP is based on [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] and gave rise to many [[Comparison of FTP client software|FTP clients]], which, in turn, gave users all around the world access to the same standard [[Communication protocol|network protocol]] to transfer data between devices.

The transfer of data saw a significant increase in popularity after the release of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991, which, for the first time, allowed users who were not computer hobbyists to easily share files, directly from their web browser over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mwdwebsites.com/nj-web-design-world-wide-web.html|title=The Evolution of the World Wide Web|last=Enzer|first=Larry|date=August 31, 2018|website=Monmouth Web Developers|access-date=August 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118231641/https://www.mwdwebsites.com/nj-web-design-world-wide-web.html|archive-date=18 November 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resumability of file transfers===
Transfers became more reliable with the launch of HTTP/1.1 in 1997 ({{IETF RFC|2068}}), which gave users the option to resume downloads that were interrupted, for instance due to unreliable connections. Before web browsers widely rolled out support, software programs like [[GetRight]] could be used to resume downloads. Resuming uploads is not currently supported by HTTP, but can be added with the [[Tus open protocol for resumable file uploads]], which layers resumability of uploads on top of existing HTTP connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://tus.io/blog/2015/11/16/tus.1.0.html|title=tus 1.0 – Changing the future of uploading|last=Van Zonneveld|first=Kevin|date=16 November 2015|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tech.eu/features/6672/transloadit-tus-protocol-vimeo|title=Berlin-based Transloadit wants to fix broken file uploads once and for all, with support from Vimeo|last=Keane|first=Jonathan|date=16 November 2015|website=Tech EU|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of uploading==

===Client-to-server uploading=== 
Transmitting a local file to a remote system following the [[client-server model]], e.g., a web browser transferring a video to a website, is called '''client-to-server uploading'''.

===Remote uploading===
Transferring data from one [[Remote administration|remote system]] to another remote system under the control of a local system is called '''remote uploading''' or site-to-site transferring. This is used when a local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but these systems have a fast connection between them. Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be downloaded to the local system and then uploaded to the remote server, both times over a slower connection. Remote uploading is used by some online [[Comparison of file hosting services |file hosting services]]. Another example can be found in [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] clients, which often support the [[File eXchange Protocol]] (FXP) in order to instruct two [[Comparison of FTP server software packages|FTP servers]] with high-speed connections to exchange files. A web-based example is the [[Uppy file uploader]] that can transfer files from a user's [[cloud storage]] such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], directly to a website without first going to the user's device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tipsteacher.com|title=Uppy File Uploading|last=Walsh|first=David|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer-to-peer=== 
'''Peer-to-peer''' (P2P) is a [[Distributed computing|decentralized]] communications model in which each party has the same capabilities, and either party can initiate a communication session. Unlike the [[client-server model]], in which the client makes a service request and the server fulfils the request (by sending or accepting a file transfer), the [[peer-to-peer|P2P]] network model allows each [[Node (networking)|node]] to function as both client and server. [[BitTorrent]] is an example of this, as is the [[InterPlanetary File System]] (IPFS). Peer-to-peer allows users to both ''receive'' (download) and ''host'' (upload) content. Files are transferred directly between the users' computers. The same file transfer constitutes an upload for one party, and a download for the other party.

==Copyright issues==
The rising popularity of file sharing during the 1990s culminated in the emergence of [[Napster]], a music-sharing [[Computing platform|platform]] specialized in [[MP3]] files that used peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing technology to allow users exchange files freely. The P2P nature meant there was no central gatekeeper for the content, which eventually led to the widespread availability of [[Copyright|copyrighted]] material through Napster.

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) took notice of Napster's ability to distribute copyrighted music among its user base, and, on December 6, 1999, filed a [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. (2000)|motion]] for a [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] in order to stop the exchange of copyrighted songs on the service. After a failed appeal by Napster, the injunction was granted on March 5, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;2001 US Dist. LEXIS 2186 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2001), aff’d, 284 F. 3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 2001, Napster, which had already shut down its entire network two months earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/12/technology/ebusiness/napster-is-told-to-remain-shut.html|title=Napster is told to remain shut|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=12 July 2001|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to pay a $26 million dollar settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cnet.com/news/napster-reaches-settlement-with-publishers|title=Napster reaches settlement with publishers|last=Borland|first=John|date=2 March 2002|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Napster had ceased operations, many other P2P file-sharing services followed in its wake, such as [[Limewire]], [[Kazaa]] and [[Popcorn Time]]. Besides [[software|software programs]], there were many [[Comparison of BitTorrent sites|BitTorrent websites]] that allowed files to be indexed and searched. These files could then be downloaded via a [[Comparison of BitTorrent clients|BitTorrent client]]. While the BitTorrent protocol itself is legal and agnostic of the type of content shared, many of the services that did not enforce a strict policy to take down copyrighted material would eventually also run into legal difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/208895/Limewire_Shut_Down_Permanently.html|title=LimeWire shut down permanently|last=Jacobson Purewall|first=Sarah|date=27 October 2010|accessdate=11 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/11/30/KaZaA.shut.down.idg/index.html|title=

In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the [[Nawab of Bengal]] under [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[suzerainty]]. After the Nawab granted the [[East India Company]] a trading [[licence]] in 1690,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dutta|first1=K.|last2=Desai|first2=A.|date=April 2008|title=Calcutta: a cultural history|publisher=Interlink Books|location=Northampton, Massachusetts, US|pages=9–10|isbn=978-1-56656-721-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area was developed by the Company into [[Fort William, India|an increasingly fortified trading post]]. Nawab [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish rule, and [[Permanent Settlement|assumed full sovereignty]] of the region. Under the company rule and later under the [[British Raj]], Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in [[Bengal]], led to a shift of the capital to [[New Delhi]]. Calcutta was the centre for the [[Indian independence movement]]. Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of Indian commerce, culture, and politics, suffered many decades of [[political violence]] and [[economic stagnation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ianjack&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Kolkata}}
The word ''Kolkata''  ({{lang-bn|কলকাতা}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkolˌkata|}}) derives from ''[[Kalikata|Kôlikata]]'' ({{Lang-bn|কলিকাতা}} 
{{IPA-bn|ˈkɔliˌkata|}}), the Bengali name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British, in the area where the city was eventually established; the other two villages were [[Sutanuti]] and [[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Govindapur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spatialchange&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Globalizing cities: a new spatial order?|url= https://archive.org/details/globalizingcitie00marc|url-access= limited|last=Chakravorty|first=Sanjoy|editor1-last=Marcuse |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Kempen |editor2-first=Ronald van |chapter=From colonial city to global city?

There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:
* ''Kolikata'' is thought to be a variation of ''Kalikkhetrô'' ({{Lang-bn|কালীক্ষেত্র}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkaliˌkʰːetrɔ|}}), meaning &quot;Field of [the goddess] [[Kali]]&quot;. Similarly, it can be a variation of 'Kalikshetra' ([[Sanskrit]]: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. &quot;area of Goddess Kali&quot;).
* Another theory is that the name derives from [[Kalighat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalighattemple.com/|title=Kalighat Kali Temple|website=kalighattemple.com|language=en|access-date=24 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134630/http://kalighattemple.com/|archive-date=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term ''kilkila'' ({{lang-bn|কিলকিলা}}), or &quot;flat area&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatterjeename&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Water resources, conservation and management |last=Chatterjee |first=S.N. |year=2008 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-269-0868-4 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |access-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619194712/http://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |archive-date=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name may have its origin in the words ''khal'' ({{lang-bn|খাল}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkʰal|}}) meaning &quot;canal&quot;, followed by ''kaṭa'' ({{lang-bn|কাটা}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkaʈa|}}), which may mean &quot;dug&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
|last = Nair|first=P. Thankappan |title = Calcutta in the 17th century |pages=54–58|publisher = Firma KLM |location=Kolkata|year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] or ''koli chun'' ({{lang-bn|কলি চুন}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkɔliˌtʃun|}}) and coir or ''kata'' ({{lang-bn|কাতা}} {{IPA-bn|ˈkata|}}); hence, it was called ''Kolikata'').&lt;ref name=&quot;chatterjeename&quot; /&gt; 
Although the city's name has always been pronounced ''Kolkata'' or ''Kôlikata'' in Bengali, the anglicised form ''Calcutta'' was the official name until 2001, when it [[Renaming of cities in India|was changed]] to ''Kolkata'' in order to match Bengali pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/india.html |title= The politics of name changes in India|access-date=26 January 2012|last=Easwaran|first= Kenny|publisher=Open Computing Facility, University of California at Berkeley

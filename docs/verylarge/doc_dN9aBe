Although by now it was 3 p.m., Jackson decided to march his men two miles farther and turn right on the Turnpike instead, allowing him to strike the unprotected flank directly. The attack formation consisted of two lines—the divisions of Brig. Gens. [[Robert E. Rodes]] and [[Raleigh E. Colston]]—stretching almost a mile on either side of the turnpike, separated by 200 yards, followed by a partial line with the arriving division of A.P. Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 84–86; Salmon, p. 179; Cullen, p. 34; Sears, pp. 257–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant contributions to the impending Union disaster were the nature of the Union XI Corps and the incompetent performance of its commander, Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]]. Howard failed to make any provision for defending against a surprise attack, even though Hooker had ordered him to do so. The Union right flank was not anchored on any natural obstacle, and the only defenses against a flank attack consisted of two cannons pointing out into the Wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, p. 90; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Sears, pp. 237–38, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the XI Corps was not well respected – an outfit with poor morale and no history of battlefield success. Many of its officers and enlisted men were immigrants from Germany and other parts of Central Europe, including a number of political refugees from the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|1848 revolutions]]. The corps had been formed in the spring of 1862 by merging Brig. Gen [[Louis Blenker]]'s division with Maj. Gen [[John C. Frémont]]'s Mountain Department in West Virginia. After a miserable trek across Virginia in which Blenker's troops were provisioned inadequately and suffered from widespread hunger, disease, and desertion, they joined with Fremont in a campaign that resulted in them being soundly defeated by Stonewall Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, p. 90; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Sears, pp. 237–38, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fremont's army became part of Maj. Gen [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of Virginia]] in the summer. Fremont had refused to serve under Pope and was replaced by Maj. Gen [[Franz Sigel]], an inept political general who, however, was much beloved by his German troops. Louis Blenker fell from a horse during the [[northern Virginia campaign]] and suffered injuries that would claim his life later in 1863. The corps suffered heavy casualties at [[Second Bull Run]] and was left behind in Washington D.C. during the [[Maryland campaign]]. During the Fredericksburg campaign, it did not join the rest of the army until after the battle was over.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, p. 90; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Sears, pp. 237–38, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hooker took command, Sigel was the ranking general behind him. The XI Corps was the smallest in the army and Sigel's requests to general-in-chief [[Henry Halleck]] to have it enlarged were refused, so he resigned his command in March 1863 and was replaced by Maj. Gen [[Oliver O. Howard]], who was widely unpopular with the enlisted men and brought in several new generals such as Brig. Gen [[Francis C. Barlow|Francis Barlow]] who had a reputation of being aggressive martinets. Eight of the 27 regiments in the corps had never been in battle before, while the remaining 21 had never been on the winning side of a battle. The German soldiers suffered from widespread ethnic friction with the rest of the army although a number of the regiments in the XI Corps consisted of native-born Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, p. 90; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Sears, pp. 237–38, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker had no major plans for the corps except for mopping up after the main battle was over, and it was placed out on the army's right flank where it was not expected to be involved in any fighting, and the woods to the west were assumed to be so thick that enemy troops could not possibly move through them and form a line of battle. As far as Hooker knew, the only possible route for a Confederate attack was along the turnpike, which would cause them to run right into the II and XII Corps, both elite outfits and well-entrenched. Further north, the Union line was held by the V Corps, also first-rate troops occupying an almost impregnable position.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, p. 90; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Sears, pp. 237–38, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the day wore on, the men of the XI Corps became increasingly aware that something was going on in the woods to the west of them, but were unable to get any higher-ups to pay attention. Col. John C. Lee of the [[55th Ohio Infantry|55th Ohio]] received numerous reports of a Confederate presence out there, and Col. William Richardson of the [[25th Ohio Infantry|25th Ohio]] reported that huge numbers of Confederates were massing to the west. Col. Leopold von Gilsa, who commanded one of two brigades in Brig. Gen [[Charles Devens]]' division, went to Howard's headquarters warning him that an all-out enemy assault was imminent, but Howard insisted that it was impossible for the Confederates to get through the dense woods. 

Maj. Gen [[Carl Schurz]], who commanded the 3rd Division of the corps, began rearranging his troops into a line of battle. Captain [[Hubert Dilger]], who commanded Battery I of the 1st Ohio Artillery, rode out on a reconnaissance mission, narrowly missed being captured by the Confederates, and rode far north, almost to the banks of the Rapidan, and back south to Hooker's headquarters, but a haughty cavalry officer dismissed his concerns and would not let him in to see the general. Dilger next went to Howard's headquarters, but was merely told that the Confederate army was retreating and that it was not acceptable to make scouting expeditions without permission of higher-ups. As the sun started to go down, all remained quiet on the XI Corps's front, the noises of the III and XII Corps engaging Lee's rear guard coming from off in the distance.

[[File:Stampede of the XI Corps.jpg|thumb|The XI Corps routs before Jackson's evening dinner time surprise attack]]
Around 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 272; Furgurson, p. 171, estimates 5:15 and states that various reports from the combatants list the starting time from as early as 4 p.m. to as late as 6 p.m.&lt;/ref&gt;Jackson turned to Robert Rodes and asked him &quot;General, are you ready?&quot; When Rodes nodded, Jackson replied &quot;You may go forward then.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 261. Only two-thirds of Jackson's marching column participated in the assault. Some of A.P. Hill's men arrived late, other units were detached to guard the Orange Plank Road.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the men of the XI Corps were encamped and sitting down for supper and had their rifles unloaded and stacked. Their first clue to the impending onslaught was the observation of numerous animals, such as rabbits and foxes, fleeing in their direction out of the western woods. This was followed by the crackle of musket fire, and then the unmistakable scream of the &quot;[[Rebel Yell]]&quot;. 

Two of von Gilsa's regiments, the 153rd Pennsylvania and 54th New York, had been placed up as a heavy skirmish line and the massive Confederate assault rolled completely over them. A few men managed to get off a shot or two before fleeing. The pair of artillery pieces at the very end of the XI Corps line were captured by the Confederates and promptly turned on their former owners. Devens's division collapsed in a matter of minutes, slammed on three sides by almost 30,000 Confederates. Col. [[Robert Reily]] and his 75th Ohio managed to resist for about ten minutes before the regiment disintegrated with 150 casualties, including Reily himself, and joined the rest of the fleeing mob. 

Col. Lee would later write sarcastically, &quot;A rifle pit is useless when the enemy is on the same side and in rear of your line.&quot; Some men tried to stand and resist, but they were knocked over by their fleeing comrades and a hail of Confederate bullets. Maj. Gen. [[Carl Schurz]] ordered his division to shift from an east-west alignment to north-south, which they did with amazing precision and speed. They resisted for about 20 minutes and &quot;Leatherbreeches&quot; Dilger managed to drive the Confederates off the turnpike for a bit with his guns, but the sheer weight of Jackson's assault overwhelmed them, too, and they soon had to flee. 

Dilger for a time stood alone with a gun firing double-shotted canister at the attackers, then limbered up to flee as the Confederates closed in on him. Three of his artillery horses were shot dead, and when he realized that the gun could not be moved, he had to abandon it. General Howard partially redeemed his inadequate performance prior to the battle by his personal bravery in attempting to rally the troops. He stood shouting and waving a flag held under the stump of his amputated arm lost at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] in 1862, ignoring the danger of the heavy rifle fire, but he could only gather small pockets of soldiers to resist before his corps disintegrated. Col. Adolf Buschbeck's brigade put up a last-ditch stand along with Dilger's guns. They too had to retreat, but maintained good order as they went.

The chaos unfurling on the Union right had gone unnoticed at Hooker's headquarters until at last the sound of gunfire could be heard in the distance, followed by a panic-stricken mob of men and horses pouring into the Chancellorsville clearing. A staff officer yelled &quot;My God, here they come!&quot; as the mob ran to and past the Chancellor mansion. Hooker jumped onto his horse and frantically tried to take action. He ordered Maj. Gen [[Hiram Gregory Berry|Hiram Berry]]'s division of the III Corps, once his own division, forward, yelling &quot;Receive them on your bayonets!&quot; Artillerymen around the clearing began moving guns into position around Fairview Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 104–105, 118; Sears, pp. 260–81; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Cullen, p. 34; Welcher, p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, down at Hazel Grove, the [[8th Pennsylvania Cavalry]] were relaxing and awaiting orders to chase after Confederate wagon trains, also oblivious to the collapse of the XI Corps. The regiment's commander, Maj. Pennock Huey, received a notice that General Howard was requesting some cavalry. Huey saddled up his men and headed west along the turnpike, where they ran straight into Robert Rodes's division. After a confused fight, the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry retreated to the safety of the Chancellorsville clearing with the loss of 30 men and three officers.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 104–105, 118; Sears, pp. 260–81; Eicher, pp. 480–82; Cullen, p. 34; Welcher, p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Staying Jackson's Advance.jpg|thumb|right|XII Corps artillery halts Jackson's surprise attack]]
[[File:The Photographic History of The Civil War Volume 02 Page 125.jpg|thumb|upright|Lower right photograph of trees shattered by artillery shells near where Jackson was shot on the Orange Plank Road.]]

By nightfall, the Confederate Second Corps had advanced more than 1.25 miles, to within sight of Chancellorsville, but darkness and confusion were taking their toll. The attackers were almost as disorganized as the routed defenders. Although the XI Corps had been defeated, it had retained some coherence as a unit. The corps suffered nearly 2,500 casualties (259 killed, 1,173 wounded, and 994 missing or captured), about one quarter of its strength, including 12 of 23 regimental commanders, which suggests that they fought fiercely during their retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 281, 287, 289–91, 300–302, 488; Welcher, p. 673; Eicher, p. 483; Salmon, p. 180; Krick, pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jackson's force was now separated from Lee's men only by Sickles's corps, which had been separated from the main body of the army after its foray attacking Jackson's column earlier in the afternoon. Like everyone else in the Union army, the III Corps had been unaware of Jackson's attack. When he first heard the news, Sickles was skeptical, but finally believed it and decided to pull back to Hazel Grove.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 281, 287, 289–91, 300–302, 488; Welcher, p. 673; Eicher, p. 483; Salmon, p. 180; Krick, pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickles became increasingly nervous, knowing that his troops were facing an unknown number of Confederates to the west. A patrol of Jackson's troops was driven back by Union gunners, a minor incident that would come to be exaggerated into a heroic repulse of Jackson's entire command. Between 11 p.m. and midnight, Sickles organized an assault north from Hazel Grove toward the Plank Road, but called it off when his men began suffering artillery and rifle [[friendly fire]] from the Union XII Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 281, 287, 289–91, 300–302, 488; Welcher, p. 673; Eicher, p. 483; Salmon, p. 180; Krick, pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stonewall Jackson wanted to press his advantage before Hooker and his army could regain their bearings and plan a counterattack, which might still succeed because of the sheer disparity in numbers. He rode out onto the Plank Road that night to determine the feasibility of a night attack by the light of the full moon, traveling beyond the farthest advance of his men. When one of his staff officers warned him about the dangerous position, Jackson replied, &quot;The danger is all over. The enemy is routed. Go back and tell A.P. Hill to press right on.&quot; 

As he and his staff started to return, they were incorrectly identified as Union cavalry by men of the [[18th North Carolina Infantry]], who hit Jackson with [[friendly fire]]. Jackson's three bullet wounds were not in themselves life-threatening, but his left arm was broken and had to be amputated. While recovering, he contracted [[pneumonia]] and died on May 10. His death was a devastating loss for the Confederacy. Some historians and participants—particularly those of the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] movement—attribute the Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] two months later to Jackson's absence.

The Union gunners at Fairview Cemetery were alert and nervous; they were a few hundred yards behind Berry's division and still-intact elements of the XI Corps and they found it quite impossible to fire their guns without the shells going over the heads of the infantrymen in front of them. A few friendly-fire casualties resulted from this as the gunners were quick to shoot at anything that looked like enemy soldiers; when they got sight of a large body of Confederates drawing near, they let loose a huge cannonade that landed on and around the party that was carrying the wounded Jackson to the rear and did end up wounding A.P. Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, pp. 196–206, 213–16; Krick, pp. 136–46; Salmon, pp. 180–81; Sears, pp. 293–97, 306–307, 446–49; Smith, pp. 123–27.

===May 3: Chancellorsville===
[[File:Chancellorsville May3a.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Chancellorsville, actions on '''May 3''', '''dawn to 10 a.m.''']]
[[File:WPMA04 CHANCELLORSVILLE, 3 May 1863.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle of Chancellorsville, '''3 May''' 1863 ('''Situation Early''')]]
Despite the fame of Stonewall Jackson's victory on May 2, it did not result in a significant military advantage for the Army of Northern Virginia. Howard's XI Corps had been defeated, but the Army of the Potomac remained a potent force and Reynolds's I Corps had arrived overnight, which replaced Howard's losses. About 76,000 Union men faced 43,000 Confederate at the Chancellorsville front. The two halves of Lee's army at Chancellorsville were separated by Sickles's III Corps, which occupied a strong position on high ground at Hazel Grove.&lt;ref&gt;Goolrick, 140–42; Esposito, text for map 88; Sears, pp. 312–14, 316–20; Salmon, pp. 181–82; Cullen, pp. 36–39; Welcher, p. 675.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless Lee could devise a plan to eject Sickles from Hazel Grove and combine the two halves of his army, he would have little chance of success in assaulting the formidable Union earthworks around Chancellorsville. Fortunately for Lee, Joseph Hooker inadvertently cooperated. Early on May 3, Hooker ordered Sickles to move from Hazel Grove to a new position on the Plank Road. As they were withdrawing, the trailing elements of Sickles's corps were attacked by the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. [[James J. Archer]], which captured about 100 prisoners and four cannons. Hazel Grove was soon turned into a powerful artillery platform with 30 guns under Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander|Porter Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;Goolrick, 140–42; Esposito, text for map 88; Sears, pp. 312–14, 316–20; Salmon, pp. 181–82; Cullen, pp. 36–39; Welcher, p. 675.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jackson was wounded on May 2, command of the Second Corps fell to his senior division commander, Maj. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]. Hill was soon wounded himself. He consulted with Brig. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]], the next most senior general in the corps, and Rodes acquiesced in Hill's decision to summon Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]] to take command, notifying Lee after the fact. Brig. Gen. [[Henry Heth]] replaced Hill in division command.&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 676–77; Eicher, pp. 483–85; Salmon, pp. 182–83; Krick, p. 199. Sears, p. 325: &quot;Under the particular conditions he inherited, then, it is hard to see how Jeb Stuart, in a new command, a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time, could have done a better job.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Stuart was a cavalryman who had never commanded infantry before, he was to deliver a creditable performance at Chancellorsville. By the morning of May 3, the Union line resembled a horseshoe. The center was held by the III, XII, and II Corps. On the left were the remnants of the XI Corps, and the right was held by the V and I Corps. On the western side of the Chancellorsville salient, Stuart organized his three divisions to straddle the Plank Road: Heth's in the advance, Colston's 300–500 yards behind, and Rodes's, whose men had done the hardest fighting on May 2, near the Wilderness Church.&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 676–77; Eicher, pp. 483–85; Salmon, pp. 182–83; Krick, p. 199. Sears, p. 325: &quot;Under the particular conditions he inherited, then, it is hard to see how Jeb Stuart, in a new command, a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time, could have done a better job.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack began about 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. supported by the newly installed artillery at Hazel Grove, and by simultaneous attacks by the divisions of Anderson and McLaws from the south and southeast. The Confederates were resisted fiercely by the Union troops behind strong earthworks, and the fighting on May 3 was the heaviest of the campaign. The initial waves of assaults by Heth and Colston gained a little ground, but were beaten back by Union counterattacks.&lt;ref&gt;Welcher, pp. 676–77; Eicher, pp. 483–85; Salmon, pp. 182–83; Krick, p. 199. Sears, p. 325: &quot;Under the particular conditions he inherited, then, it is hard to see how Jeb Stuart, in a new command, a cavalryman commanding infantry and artillery for the first time, could have done a better job.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodes sent his men in last and this final push, along with the excellent performance of the Confederate artillery, carried the morning battle. Chancellorsville was the only occasion in the war in Virginia in which Confederate gunners held a decided advantage over their Federal counterparts. Confederate guns on Hazel Grove were joined by 20 more on the Plank Road to duel effectively with the Union guns on neighboring Fairview Hill, causing the Federals to withdraw as ammunition ran low and Confederate infantrymen picked off the gun crews.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 183; Sears, pp. 319–20; Welcher, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairview was evacuated at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., briefly recaptured in a counterattack, but by 10 a.m. Hooker ordered it abandoned for good. The loss of this artillery platform doomed the Union position at the Chancellorsville crossroads as well, and the Army of the Potomac began a fighting retreat to positions circling United States Ford. The soldiers of the two halves of Lee's army reunited shortly after 10 a.m. before the Chancellor mansion, wildly triumphant as Lee arrived on [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]] to survey the scene of his victory.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, p. 183; Sears, pp. 319–20; Welcher, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Lee's presence was the signal for one of those uncontrollable bursts of enthusiasm which none can appreciate who has not witnessed them. The fierce soldiers, with their faces blackened with the smoke of battle, the wounded crawling with feeble limbs from the fury of the devouring flames, all seemed possessed with a common impulse. One long unbroken cheer, in which the feeble cry of those who lay helpless on the earth blended with the strong voices of those who still fought, rose high above the roar of battle and hailed the presence of a victorious chief. He sat in the full realization of all that soldiers dream of—triumph; and as I looked at him in the complete fruition of the success which his genius, courage, and confidence in his army had won, I thought that it must have been from some such scene that men in ancient days ascended to the dignity of gods.|Charles Marshall, Lee's military secretary|An Aide-de-Camp to Lee&lt;ref&gt;Evans, vol. 3, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the height of the fighting on May 3, Hooker suffered an injury when at 9:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. a Confederate cannonball hit a wooden pillar he was leaning against at his headquarters. He later wrote that half of the pillar &quot;violently [struck me] ... in an erect position from my head to my feet.&quot; He likely received a concussion, which was sufficiently severe to render him unconscious for over an hour. Although clearly incapacitated after he arose, Hooker refused to turn over command temporarily to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. [[Darius N. Couch]], and, with Hooker's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Butterfield]], and Sedgwick out of communication (again due to the failure of the telegraph lines), there was no one at headquarters with sufficient rank or stature to convince Hooker otherwise. This failure may have affected Union performance over the next day and may have directly contributed to Hooker's seeming lack of nerve and timid performance throughout the rest of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 336–39; Welcher, p. 678; Eicher, pp. 485–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lee was savoring his victory at the Chancellorsville crossroads, he received disturbing news: Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]]'s force had broken through the Confederate lines at Fredericksburg and was headed toward Chancellorsville. On the night of May 2, in the aftermath of Jackson's flank attack, Hooker had ordered Sedgwick to &quot;cross the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg on the receipt of this order, and at once take up your line of march on the Chancellorsville road until you connect with him. You will attack and destroy any force you may fall in with on the road.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 308–11, 350–51; Welcher, pp. 679–80; Cullen, pp. 41–42; Goolrick, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee had left a relatively small force at Fredericksburg, ordering Brig. Gen. [[Jubal Early]] to &quot;watch the enemy and try to hold him.&quot; If he was attacked in &quot;overwhelming numbers,&quot; Early was to retreat to Richmond, but if Sedgwick withdrew from his front, he was to join with Lee at Chancellorsville. On the morning of May 2, Early received a garbled message from Lee's staff that caused him to start marching most of his men toward Chancellorsville, but he quickly returned after a warning from Brig. Gen. [[William Barksdale]] of a Union advance against Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 308–11, 350–51; Welcher, pp. 679–80; Cullen, pp. 41–42; Goolrick, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 7 a.m. on May 3, Early was confronted with four Union divisions: Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]] of the II Corps had crossed the Rappahannock north of town, and three divisions of Sedgwick's VI Corps—Maj. Gen. [[John Newton (engineer)|John Newton]] and Brig. Gens. [[Albion P. Howe]] and [[William T. H. Brooks]]—were arrayed in line from the front of the town to Deep Run. Most of Early's combat strength was deployed to the south of town, where Federal troops had achieved their most significant successes during the December battle. Marye's Heights was defended by Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Early ordered the Louisiana brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Harry T. Hays]] from the far right to Barksdale's left.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 308–11, 350–51; Welcher, pp. 679–80; Cullen, pp. 41–42; Goolrick, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

By midmorning, two Union attacks against the infamous stone wall on Marye's Heights were repulsed with numerous casualties. A Union party under flag of truce was allowed to approach ostensibly to collect the wounded, but while close to the stone wall, they were able to observe how sparsely the Confederate line was manned. A third Union attack was successful in overrunning the Confederate position. Early was able to organize an effective fighting retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 176–80; Welcher, pp. 680–81; Esposito, text for maps 88–89; Sears, pp. 352–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sedgwick's road to Chancellorsville was open, but he wasted time in gathering his troops and forming a marching column. His men, led by Brooks's division, followed by Newton and Howe, were delayed for several hours by successive actions against the Alabama brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]]. His final delaying line was a ridge at Salem church, where he was joined by three brigades from McLaws's division and one from Anderson's, bringing the total Confederate strength to about 10,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 176–80; Welcher, pp. 680–81; Esposito, text for maps 88–89; Sears, pp. 352–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artillery fire was exchanged by both sides in the afternoon and at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., two brigades of Brooks's division attacked on both sides of the Plank Road. The advance south of the road reached as far as the churchyard, but was driven back. The attack north of the road could not break the Confederate line. Wilcox described the action as &quot;a bloody repulse to the enemy, rendering entirely useless to him his little success of the morning at Fredericksburg.&quot; Hooker expressed his disappointment in Sedgwick: &quot;my object in ordering General Sedgwick forward ... Was to relieve me from the position in which I found myself at Chancellorsville. ... In my judgment General Sedgwick did not obey the spirit of my order, and made no sufficient effort to obey it. ... When he did move it was not with sufficient confidence or ability on his part to manoeuvre his troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson, pp. 273–88; Welcher, p. 681; Sears, pp. 378–86; Krick, pp. 181–85; Cullen, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting on May 3, 1863, was some of the most furious anywhere in the civil war. The loss of 21,357 men that day in the three battles, divided equally between the two armies, ranks the fighting only behind the [[Battle of Antietam]] as the bloodiest day of  war in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 4–6: Union withdrawals===

On the evening of May 3 and all day May 4, Hooker remained in his defenses north of Chancellorsville. Lee observed that Hooker was threatening no offensive action, so felt comfortable ordering Anderson's division to join the battle against Sedgwick. He sent orders to Early and McLaws to cooperate in a joint attack, but the orders reached his subordinates after dark, so the attack was planned for May 4.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 390–93; Welcher, pp. 681–82; Cullen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Sedgwick had placed his divisions into a strong defensive position with its flanks anchored on the Rappahannock, three sides of a rectangle extending south of the Plank Road. Early's plan was to drive the Union troops off Marye's Heights and the other high ground west of Fredericksburg. Lee ordered McLaws to engage from the west &quot;to prevent [the enemy] concentrating on General Early.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pp. 390–93; Welcher, pp. 681–82; Cullen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reoccupied Marye's Heights on the morning of May 4, cutting Sedgwick off from the town. However, McLaws was reluctant to take any action. Before noon, Lee arrived with Anderson's division, giving him a total of 21,000 men, slightly outnumbering Sedgwick. Despite Lee's presence, McLaws continued his passive role and Anderson's men took a few hours to get into position, a situation that frustrated and angered both Early and Lee, who had been planning on a concentrated assault from three directions.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 187–91; Sears, pp. 400–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack finally began around 6 p.m. Two of Early's brigades (under Brig. Gens. [[Harry T. Hays]] and [[Robert F. Hoke]]) pushed back Sedgwick's left-center across the Plank Road, but Anderson's effort was a slight one and McLaws once again contributed nothing. Throughout the day on May 4, Hooker provided no assistance or useful guidance to Sedgwick, and Sedgwick thought about little else than protecting his line of retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 187–91; Sears, pp. 400–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedgwick withdrew across the Rappahannock at Banks's Ford during the pre-dawn hours of May 5. When he learned that Sedgwick had retreated back over the river, Hooker felt he was out of options to save the campaign. He called a [[council of war]] and asked his corps commanders to vote about whether to stay and fight or to withdraw. Although a majority voted to fight, Hooker had had enough, and on the night of May 5–6, he withdrew back across the river at U.S. Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 191–96; Esposito, text for map 91; Welcher, p. 682; Cullen, p. 45; Sears, pp. 417–30. Goolrick, p. 158: In the council of war, Meade, Reynolds, and Howard voted to fight. Sickles and Couch voted to withdraw; Couch actually favored attack, but lacked confidence in Hooker's leadership. Slocum did not arrive until after the vote, and Sedgwick had already withdrawn from the battlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a difficult operation. Hooker and the artillery crossed first, followed by the infantry beginning at 6 a.m. on May 6. Meade's V Corps served as the rear guard. Rains caused the river to rise and threatened to break the pontoon bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 191–96; Esposito, text for map 91; Welcher, p. 682; Cullen, p. 45; Sears, pp. 417–30. Goolrick, p. 158: In the council of war, Meade, Reynolds, and Howard voted to fight. Sickles and Couch voted to withdraw; Couch actually favored attack, but lacked confidence in Hooker's leadership. Slocum did not arrive until after the vote, and Sedgwick had already withdrawn from the battlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

Couch was in command on the south bank after Hooker departed, but he was left with explicit orders not to continue the battle, which he had been tempted to do. The surprise withdrawal frustrated Lee's plan for one final attack against Chancellorsville. He had issued orders for his artillery to bombard the Union line in preparation for another assault, but by the time they were ready Hooker and his men were gone.&lt;ref&gt;Krick, pp. 191–96; Esposito, text for map 91; Welcher, p. 682; Cullen, p. 45; Sears, pp. 417–30. Goolrick, p. 158: In the council of war, Meade, Reynolds, and Howard voted to fight. Sickles and Couch voted to withdraw; Couch actually favored attack, but lacked confidence in Hooker's leadership. Slocum did not arrive until after the vote, and Sedgwick had already withdrawn from the battlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[George Stoneman]], after a week of ineffectual raiding in central and southern Virginia in which they failed to attack any of the objectives Hooker established, withdrew into Union lines east of Richmond—the peninsula north of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], across from [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]]—on May 7, ending the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 309; Eicher, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee, despite being outnumbered by a ratio of over two to one, won arguably his greatest victory of the war, sometimes described as his &quot;perfect battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; But he paid a terrible price for it, taking more casualties than he had lost in any previous battle, including the Confederate defeat at the [[Battle of Antietam]]. With only 60,000 men engaged, he suffered 13,303 casualties (1,665 killed, 9,081 wounded, 2,018 missing),&lt;ref name=casualties/&gt; losing some 22% of his force in the campaign—men that the Confederacy, with its limited manpower, could not replace. Just as seriously, he lost his most aggressive field commander, Stonewall Jackson. Brig. Gen. [[Elisha F. Paxton]] was the other Confederate general killed during the battle. After Longstreet rejoined the main army, he was highly critical of Lee's strategy, saying that battles like Chancellorsville cost the Confederacy more men than it could afford to lose.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 133,000 Union men engaged, 17,197 were casualties (1,606 killed, 9,672 wounded, 5,919 missing),&lt;ref name=casualties/&gt; a percentage much lower than Lee's, particularly considering that it includes 4,000 men of the XI Corps who were captured on May 2. When comparing only the killed and wounded, there were almost no differences between the Confederate and Federal losses at Chancellorsville. The Union lost three generals in the campaign: Maj. Gens. [[Hiram G. Berry]] and [[Amiel W. Whipple]] and Brig. Gen. [[Edmund Kirby (army officer)|Edmund Kirby]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of human capital==
===World Economic Forum Global Human Capital Index===
Since 2012 the [[World Economic Forum]] has annually published its Global Human Capital Report, which includes the Global Human Capital Index (GHCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-human-capital-report-2017|title=The Global Human Capital Report 2017|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2017 edition, 130 countries&lt;ref name=&quot;Observatory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitividad.org.do/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Indice-de-Capital-Humano-2017.pdf|title=Índice de Capital Humano 2017|website=Observatorio de Competitividad|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are ranked from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the quality of their investments in human capital. Norway is at the top, with 77.12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observatory&quot; /&gt;

===World Bank Human Capital Index===
{{main|Human Capital Index}}
In October 2018, the [[World Bank]] published the [[Human Capital Index]] (HCI) as a measurement of economic success. The Index ranks countries according to how much is invested in education and health care for young people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45816049 &quot;Not pounds and pence - here's a different way to measure our wealth&quot;], BBC, 11.10,2018&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; showcases the Index and explains its importance given the impact of technology on labor markets and the future of work.

===Other methods===
A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by ''[[The Lancet]]'' in September 2018. [[Finland]] had the highest level of expected human capital: 28·4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. [[Niger]] had the lowest at less than 1·6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext|title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016|last1=Lim|first1=Stephen|access-date=5 November 2018|publisher=Lancet|last2=et|first2=al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the human capital index of individual firms is also possible: a survey is made on issues like training or compensation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Community&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrmglobal.com/Qanda/54/1/What-is-Human-Capital-Index-.html|title=What is Human Capital Index ?|website=Community for Human Resource Management|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a value between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) is obtained. Enterprises which rank high are shown to add value to shareholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Community&quot; /&gt;

==Cumulative growth==
Human capital is distinctly different from the tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Human Capital: The most overlooked Asset Class |author=David Allison |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/09/human-capital.asp#axzz1Wb8QpjGs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of [[business cycle]]s. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of [[recession]] and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth over a long period of time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary|title=Human Capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis with special reference to Education|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=W. Lee|title=Education, Income and Human Capital|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human capital formation in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human capital formation in the current generation. This is the cumulative growth of human capital formation generated by superior quality of manpower in the succeeding generation as compared to the preceding generation.

===India===

In India, rate of human capital formation has consistently increased after Independence due to qualitative improvement in each generation. In the second decade of the 21st century, the third generation of India's population is active in the workforce of India. This third generation is qualitatively the most superior human resource in India. It has developed the service sector of India with the export of [[financial services]], software services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bagde|first=Surendrakumar|title=Human Capital and Economic Development in India|url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/research/251full.pdf|access-date=2018-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012224328/http://heinz.cmu.edu/research/251full.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; tourism services and improved the [[invisible balance]] of India's balance of payments. The rapid growth of the Indian economy in response to improvement in the service sector is evidence of cumulative growth of human capital in India.
This year(2019) India had ranked 158 out of 195 countries

==Importance==
The concept of human capital has relatively more importance in labour-surplus countries. These countries are naturally endowed with more of labour due to high birth rate under the given climatic conditions. The surplus labour in these countries is the human resource available in more abundance than the tangible capital resource. This human resource can be transformed into human capital with effective inputs of education, health and moral values. The transformation of raw human resource into highly productive human resource with these inputs is the process of human capital formation. The problem of scarcity of tangible capital in the labour surplus countries can be resolved by accelerating the rate of human capital formation with both private and public investment in education and health sectors of their national economies. The tangible financial capital is an effective instrument of promoting economic growth of the nation. The intangible human capital, on the other hand, is an instrument of promoting comprehensive development of the nation because human capital is directly related to human development, and when there is human development, the qualitative and quantitative progress of the nation is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflection on Human Development|last=Haq|first=Mahbub ul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|location=Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance of human capital is explicit in the changed approach of [[United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/|title=Official website|last=UN}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards comparative evaluation of economic development of different nations in the world economy. The United Nations publishes the [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/|title=HDR|last=Human Development Report|first=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; on human development in different nations with the objective of evaluating the rate of human capital formation in these nations.

The statistical indicator of estimating human development in each nation is [[Human Development Index]] (HDI). It is the combination of &quot;[[Life Expectancy Index]]&quot;, &quot;[[Education Index]]&quot; and &quot;Income Index&quot;. The life expectancy index reveals the standard of health of the population in the country; the education index reveals the educational standard and the literacy ratio of the population; and the income index reveals the standard of living of the population. If all these indices have a rising trend over a long period of time, it is reflected in a rising trend in HDI. Human capital is measured by health, education and quality of [[standard of living]]. Therefore, the components of HDI, viz, Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and Income Index, are directly related to human capital formation within the nation. HDI is indicator of positive correlation between human capital formation and economic development. If HDI increases, there is a higher rate of human capital formation in response to a higher standard of education and health. Similarly, if HDI increases, per capita income of the nation also increases. Implicitly, HDI reveals that the higher is human capital formation due to good levels of health and education, the higher is the per capita income of the nation. This process of human development is the strong foundation of a continuous process of economic development of the nation for a long period of time. This significance of the concept of human capital in generating long-term economic development of the nation cannot be neglected. It is expected that the macroeconomic policies of all the nations are focused towards promotion of human development and subsequently economic development.

Human capital is the backbone of human development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities: the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, and the capacity to draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form the backbone of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions that invest in the human capital and economic advancement of immigrants who are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/9/20%20immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer/immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer|title=Brookings Institution, ''Investing in the Human Capital of Immigrants, Strengthening Regional Economies'', September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301191252/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/9/20%20immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer/immigrants%20human%20capital%20singer|archive-date=2014-03-01|url-status=dead|access-date=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).

==Intangibility and portability==
Human capital is an [[intangible asset]], and it is not owned by the firm that employs it and is generally not fungible.  Specifically, individuals arrive at 9am and leave at 5pm (in the conventional office model) taking most of their knowledge and relationships with them.

Human capital when viewed from a time perspective consumes time in one of these key activities:

# Knowledge (activities involving one employee),
# Collaboration (activities involving more than 1 employee),
# Processes (activities specifically focused on the knowledge and collaborative activities generated by organizational structure&amp;nbsp;– such as silo impacts, internal politics, etc.) and
# Absence (annual leave, sick leave, holidays, etc.).

Despite the lack of formal ownership, firms can and do gain from high levels of training, in part because it creates a [[corporate culture]] or vocabulary teams use to create cohesion.

In recent economic writings the concept of [[firm-specific human capital]], which includes those social relationships, individual instincts, and instructional details that are of value within one firm (but not in general), appears by way of explaining some labour mobility issues and such phenomena as [[golden handcuffs]].  Workers can be more valuable where they are simply for having acquired this knowledge, these skills and these instincts.  Accordingly, the firm gains for their unwillingness to leave and market talents elsewhere.

==Marxist analysis==
[[File:Sabah Sarawak labour advert Kuala Lumpur.JPG|thumb|right|An advertisement for labour from Sabah and Sarawak, seen in Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur.]]
In some way, the idea of &quot;human capital&quot; is similar to [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of [[labor power]]: he thought in [[capitalism]] workers sold their labor power in order to receive income (wages and salaries). But long before Mincer or Becker wrote, Marx pointed to &quot;two disagreeably frustrating facts&quot; with theories that equate wages or salaries with the interest on human capital.

# The worker must actually ''work'', exert their mind and body, to earn this &quot;interest.&quot; Marx strongly distinguished between one's ''capacity'' to work, [[labor power]], and the activity of working.
# A free worker cannot sell his human capital in one go; it is far from being a liquid asset, even more illiquid than shares and land. He does not sell his skills, but contracts to utilize those skills, in the same way that an industrialist sells his produce, not his machinery. The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.

An employer must be receiving a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] from his operations, so that workers must be producing what Marx (under the [[labor theory of value]]) perceived as [[surplus-value]], i.e., doing work beyond that necessary to maintain their [[labor power]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]].  ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch29.htm volume III, ch. 29 pp. 465–6 of the International Publishers edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Though having &quot;human capital&quot; gives workers some benefits, they are still dependent on the owners of non-human wealth for their livelihood.

The term appears in Marx's article in the ''[[New-York Daily Tribune]]'' &quot;The Emancipation Question,&quot; January 17 and 22, 1859, although there the term is used to describe humans who act like a capital to the producers, rather than in the modern sense of &quot;knowledge capital&quot; endowed to or acquired by humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1858/12/31.htm ''The Emancipation Question'' in New-York Daily Tribune, January 17 and 22, 1859] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731022259/http://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1858/12/31.htm|date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Marxist economists such as Bowles have argued that education leads to higher wages not by increasing human capital, but rather by making workers more compliant and reliable in a corporate environment.

==Risk==
When human capital is assessed by activity based costing via time allocations it becomes possible to assess human capital risk. Human capital risks can be identified if HR processes in organizations are studied in detail. Human capital risk occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels.  For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the Process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human capital risk.  When wage costs are applied to this difference (the 8,000 hours) it becomes possible to financially value human capital risk within an organizational perspective.

Risk accumulates in four primary categories:
# Absence activities (activities related to employees not showing up for work such as sick leave, industrial action, etc.).  Unavoidable absence is referred to as Statutory Absence.  All other categories of absence are termed &quot;Controllable Absence&quot;;
# Collaborative activities are related to the expenditure of time between more than one employee within an organizational context.  Examples include: meetings, phone calls, instructor led training, etc.;
# Knowledge Activities are related to time expenditures by a single person and include finding/retrieving information, research, email, messaging, blogging, information analysis, etc.; and
# Process activities are knowledge and collaborative activities that result due to organizational context such as errors/rework, manual data transformation, stress, politics, etc.

==Corporate finance==
In [[corporate finance]], human capital is one of the three primary components of [[intellectual capital]] (which, in addition to tangible assets, comprise the entire value of a company).  Human capital is the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maddocks&quot;&gt;Maddocks, J. &amp; Beaney, M. 2002. See the invisible and intangible. Knowledge Management, March, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an organization's combined human capability for solving business problems. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital leaves an organization when people leave. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by creativity and innovation. A company's reputation as an employer affects the human capital it draws.&lt;ref name=&quot;sveiby.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sveiby 1997&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
Some [[labor economics|labor economists]] have criticized the Chicago-school theory, claiming that it tries to explain all differences in wages and salaries in terms of human capital.  One of the leading alternatives, advanced by [[Michael Spence]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], is &quot;signaling theory&quot;.  According to signaling theory, education does not lead to increased human capital, but rather acts as a mechanism by which workers with superior innate abilities can signal those abilities to prospective employers and so gain above average wages.

The concept of human capital can be infinitely elastic, including unmeasurable variables such as personal character or connections with insiders (via family or fraternity). This theory has had a significant share of study in the field proving that wages can be higher for employees on aspects other than human capital. Some variables that have been identified in the literature of the past few decades include, gender and nativity wage differentials, discrimination in the work place, and socioeconomic status.

The prestige of a [[credentialism|credential]] may be as important as the knowledge gained in determining the value of an education. This points to the existence of [[market failure|market imperfections]] such as non-competing groups and [[labor-market segmentation]]. In segmented labor markets, the &quot;return on human capital&quot; differs between comparably skilled labor-market groups or segments. An example of this is [[discrimination]] against minority or female employees.

Following Becker, the human capital literature often distinguishes between &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;general&quot; human capital. Specific human capital refers to skills or knowledge that is useful only to a single employer or industry, whereas general human capital (such as literacy) is useful to all employers. Economists view firm-specific human capital as risky, since firm closure or industry decline leads to skills that cannot be transferred (the evidence on the quantitative importance of firm specific capital is unresolved).

Human capital is central to debates about [[Social welfare|welfare]], [[education]], [[health care]], and [[retirement]].

In 2004, &quot;human capital&quot; ({{lang-de|Humankapital}}) was named the [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by a jury of linguistic scholars, who considered the term inappropriate and inhumane, as individuals would be degraded and their abilities classified according to economically relevant quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l42/l0/F.html#featuredEntry Spiegel Online: ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Human capital&quot; is often confused with human development. The UN suggests &quot;Human development denotes both the process of widening people's choices and improving their well-being&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdr.undp.org&quot;&gt;Composite indices — HDI and beyond,http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114183701/http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/indices/|date=2013-11-14}}, retrieved July 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Human Development indices suggest that human capital is merely a means to the end of human development: &quot;Theories of human capital formation and human resource development view human beings as means to increased income and wealth rather than as ends. These theories are concerned with human beings as inputs to increasing production&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdr.undp.org&quot; /&gt;

Garuda is a part of state insignia in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The [[Indonesia]]n official coat of arms is centered on the Garuda. The [[national emblem of Indonesia]] is called ''Garuda Pancasila''. The [[Indian Air Force]] also uses the Garuda in their coat of arms and named their special operations unit after it as [[Garud Commando Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;embassyofindonesia.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/about/natsymbols.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827103247/http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/about/natsymbols.htm |archivedate=27 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with the ''[[greater adjutant]] (Leptoptilos dubius)'' stork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garuda's population now 500 in Bhagalpur, Bihar|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/garudas-population-now-500-in-bihar_1617481.html|website=Zee News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723004138/http://zeenews.india.com/news/eco-news/garudas-population-now-500-in-bihar_1617481.html|archivedate=23 July 2015|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stork nests spread|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/stork-nests-spread/cid/1371119|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|date=16 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], {{IAST|Garuda}} is a divine eagle-like sun bird and the king of birds.&lt;ref name=williams21&gt;{{cite book|author=George M.

According to George Williams, Garuda has roots in the verb ''gri'', or speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p138&quot;/&gt; He is a metaphor in the Vedic literature for ''Rik'' (rhythms), ''Saman'' (sounds), ''Yajna'' (sacrifices), and the ''atman'' (Self, deepest level of consciousness). In the Puranas, states Williams, Garuda becomes a literal embodiment of the idea, and the Self who attached to and inseparable from the Supreme Self (Vishnu).&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008p138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyczkowski1988p40&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

===Iconography===
[[File:Bharhut portable Garuda pillar.jpg|thumb|upright|Relief depicting a portable Garuda pillar, one of the oldest images of Garuda, [[Bharhut]], 100 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, The Roots of Indian Art, 1980, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Hindu texts on Garuda iconography vary in their details. If in the bird form, he is eagle-like, typically with the wings slightly open as if ready and willing to fly wherever he needs to.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; In part human-form, he may have an eagle-like nose, beak or legs, his eyes are open and big, his body is the color of emerald, his wings are golden-yellow. He may be shown with either two or four hands.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; If he is not carrying Vishnu, he holds a jar of ''amrita'' (immortality nectar) in one hand in the rear and an umbrella in the other, while the front pair of hands are in ''anjali'' ([[namaste]]) posture. If he is carrying Vishnu, the rear hands provide the support for Vishnu's feet.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson2001p253&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E. Donaldson|title=The iconography of Vaiṣṇava images in Orissa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BvqAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=DK Printworld|pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the text ''Silparatna'', states Rao, Garuda is best depicted with only two hands and with four bands of colours: &quot;golden yellow colour from feet to knees, white from knees to the navel, scarlet from navel to neck, and black above the neck&quot;. His hands, recommends the text, should be in ''abhaya'' (nothing to fear) posture.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; In ''Sritatvanidhi'' text, the recommended iconography for Garuda is a kneeling figure, who wears one or more serpents, pointed bird-beak like nose, his two hands in ''namaste'' posture. This style is commonly found in Hindu temples dedicated to Vishnu.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt;

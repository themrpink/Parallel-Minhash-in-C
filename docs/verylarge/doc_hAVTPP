== Controversy ==
===Bash camps===
The college knew in 1982 of allegations of sadomasochistic abuse of boys and young men attending summer camps run by the [[Iwerne Trust]] in the 1970s, &quot;to ensure that future members of the establishment were committed Christians&quot; These were known as “Bash camps” after the nickname of their founder, [[E. J. H. Nash]]. Neither the college nor the Trust reported these bare-buttocks beatings to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laville |first1=Sandra |last2=Sherwood |first2=Harriet |title=Public school defends role in alleged cover up of abuse at Christian camps |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/02/public-school-defends-role-in-alleged-cover-up-of-abuse-at-christian-camps |accessdate=13 August 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator, [[John Smyth (barrister)|John Smyth]] QC, now deceased was warned off and moved to Zimbabwe and then South Africa where abuse continued. Hampshire police are investigating and the college is cooperating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sherwood |first1=Harriet |title=Welby in spotlight over sadistic abuse claims at Christian camps |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/justin-welby-church-scrutiny-sadistic-christian-camp |accessdate=13 August 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Price-fixing ===
In 2005, Winchester College was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an unlawful [[price-fixing]] cartel by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (&quot;OFT&quot;).&lt;ref name=SCASTPriceFixing&gt;[The Schools Competition Act Settlement Trust {{cite web |url=http://www.scast.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=54 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320120955/http://www.scast.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=54 |archive-date=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}]&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the schools involved agreed to make penalty payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in which fee information was shared.&lt;ref name=OFTPriceFixing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06|title=The Office of Fair Trading: OFT names further trustees as part of the independent schools settlement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=oft.gov.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610055129/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06|archive-date=10 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OFT offered both Winchester College and Eton a fifty percent reduction in their penalties in return for their full cooperation with the investigation.&lt;ref name=TimesPriceFixing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-26 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007080058/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece |archive-date=7 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }} The Times Online&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;&lt;ref name=TelegraphPriceFixing&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html | title = Private schools send papers to fee-fixing inquiry | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date = 3 January 2004 | accessdate = 15 March 2010 |url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130625070958/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html | archive-date = 25 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination fraud ===

In 2017 Winchester College suspended a member of the staff for providing students with information about questions on an upcoming public exam.&lt;ref name=TimesFraud&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/exam-fraud-scandal-at-winchester-college-7mff3dp8p|title=Exam fraud scandal at Winchester College|first=Callum|last=Adams|date=28 August 2017|accessdate=2 May 2018|newspaper=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster of Winchester confirmed that the school had treated the matter &quot;very seriously&quot; and that no boy was responsible for the &quot;exam irregularity&quot;.

==Southern Railway V (‘Schools’) Class Locomotive No. 901==

As with other prominent independent schools, a locomotive of the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] [[SR V Schools class|V Class]] was named after Winchester College. The second of the class, No. 901 ''Winchester'' was constructed by Southern at the nearby [[Eastleigh Works]]; it entered service in 1930. It was selected by the railway's new chief mechanical engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]] for rebuilding with a [[Lemaître exhaust|Lemaître]] multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney from 1939 onwards. Upon passing into [[British Railways]] ownership in 1948, it was renumbered 30901. It was withdrawn from service in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, J. H. ''A Pictorial History of Southern Locomotives'', Haynes Publishing, 1991, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Led Zeppelin Remasters''''' is a three-LP (or two-cassette or two-CD) [[compilation album]] of digitally remastered material by English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Containing songs from eight of the band's nine studio albums, it was initially released in the UK and Japan by [[Atlantic Records]] on 15 October 1990. The album is essentially a scaled-down version of the four-CD ''[[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set]]''.

This compilation set came about as a result of the initially rushed conversion of Led Zeppelin's album to the [[compact disc]] format in the late 1980s. Led Zeppelin were among the first rock bands to be re-issued on CD, but such was the haste to capitalise on the new format that the new CDs were derived not from re-equalised [[master tapes]], but from sound-generation tapes that had been equalised for the original vinyl platters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snow1990&quot;&gt;Mat Snow, &quot;Apocalypse Then&quot;, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, December 1990, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; For this 1990 reissue, Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] himself supervised the mastering process, which was based on Led Zeppelin's archive of master tapes.

The '''Democratic Republic of Afghanistan''' ('''DRA'''; {{lang-prs|جمهوری دمکراتی افغانستان}}, ''{{transl|prs|Jumhūri-ye Dimukrātī-ye Afġānistān}}''; {{lang-ps|دافغانستان دمکراتی جمهوریت}}, ''{{transl|ps|Dǝ Afġānistān Dimukratī Jumhūriyat}}''), renamed the '''Republic of Afghanistan''' in 1987 ({{lang-prs|جمهوری افغانستان}}; ''{{transl|prs|Jumhūrī-ye Afġānistān}}''; {{lang-ps|د افغانستان جمهوریت}}, ''{{transl|ps|Dǝ Afġānistān Jumhūriyat}}''), existed from 1978 to 1992, during which time the [[socialist]] [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) ruled [[Afghanistan]].

The PDPA came to power through a military coup known as the [[Saur Revolution]], which ousted the government of [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]]. Daoud was succeeded by [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] as head of state and government on 30 April 1978. Taraki and [[Hafizullah Amin]], the organiser of the Saur Revolution, introduced several contentious reforms during their rule, the most notable being equal rights to women, universal education and land reform. Soon after taking power a power struggle began between the [[Khalq faction]] led by Taraki and Amin and the [[Parcham faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]]. The Khalqists won and the Parchamites were purged from the party. The most prominent Parcham leaders were exiled to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

After the Khalq–Parcham struggle, a power struggle within the Khalq faction began between Taraki and Amin. Amin won the struggle, and Taraki was killed on his orders. His rule proved unpopular within his own country (due to the reforms mentioned earlier) and in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet Union intervened, supported by the Afghan government, in December 1979, and on 27 December Amin was assassinated by Soviet military forces. Karmal became the leader of Afghanistan in his place. The Karmal era, lasting from 1979 to 1986, is best known for the [[Soviet Afghan war|Soviet war effort in Afghanistan]] against [[mujahideen]] insurgents. The war resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties, as well as millions of refugees who fled into [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The Fundamental Principles, a constitution, was introduced by the government in April 1980, and several non-PDPA members were allowed into government as part of the government's policy of broadening its support base. Karmal's policies failed to bring peace to the war-ravaged country, and in 1986 he was succeeded as PDPA General Secretary by [[Mohammad Najibullah]].

Najibullah pursued a policy of [[National Reconciliation]] with the opposition, a new Afghan constitution was introduced in 1987 and [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1988|democratic elections were held in 1988]] (which were boycotted by the mujahideen). After the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan]] in 1988–1989, the government faced increasing resistance. 1990 proved to be a year of change in Afghan politics: a new constitution was introduced, which stated that Afghanistan was an [[Islamic republic]], and the PDPA was transformed into the Watan Party, which has survived to this day as the [[Democratic Watan Party of Afghanistan|Democratic Watan Party]]. On the military front, the government proved capable of defeating the armed opposition in open battle, as in the [[Afghan Civil War (1989–1992)#Battle of Jalalabad (1989)|Battle of Jalalabad]]. However, with an aggressive armed opposition, internal difficulties such as a [[1990 Afghan coup attempt|failed coup attempt]] by the Khalq faction in 1990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Najibullah government collapsed in April 1992.

Geographically, the DRA was bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; the [[Soviet Union]] (via the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen]], [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek]], and [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSRs]]) in the north; and [[China]] in the far northeast covering {{convert|652,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/25/ghosts-of-afghanistan-jonathan-steele|title=Ghosts of Afghanistan: Hard Truths and Foreign Myths by Jonathan Steele - review|work=The Guardian|date=25 September 2011|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammad Daoud Khan]], the President of the [[Republic of Afghanistan]] from 1973 to 1978, was ousted during the [[Saur Revolution]] (April Revolution) following the death of [[Mir Akbar Khyber]], a [[Parcham]]ite politician from the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) who died under mysterious circumstances.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp= [https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&amp;pg=PA110 110–111]}} [[Hafizullah Amin]], a [[Khalq]], was the coup's chief architect.{{sfn|Hussain|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRW_M_xybyYC&amp;pg=PA95 95]}} [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], the leader of the Khalqists, was elected [[President of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the Presidium of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]], [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]] and retained his post as General Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]].{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} Under him was [[Babrak Karmal]], the leader of the Parcham faction, as Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council{{sfn|Brecher|Wilkenfeld|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA356 356]}} and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Amin as Council of Ministers deputy chairman{{sfn|Asthana|Nirmal|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&amp;pg=PA219 219]}} and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]] as Council of Ministers deputy chairman.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}} The appointment of Karmal, Amin and Watanjar as Council of Ministers deputy chairmen proved unstable, and it led to three different governments being established within the government; the Khalq faction was answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA70 70–71]}}

The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, altered his position; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists (they implied that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution). To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}} On 27 June, three months after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA72 72–73]}} The meeting decided that the Khalqists had the exclusive right to formulate and decide policy, which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled. Later, a coup planned by the Parchamites, and led by Karmal, was discovered by the Khalqist leadership. The discovery of the coup prompted a swift reaction; a purge of Parchamites began. Parchamite ambassadors were recalled, but few returned; for instance, Karmal and [[Mohammad Najibullah]] stayed in their respective countries.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&amp;pg=PA73 73]}}

During Taraki's rule, an unpopular [[land reform]] was introduced, leading to the requisitioning of land by the government without compensation; it disrupted lines of credit and led to some boycotts by crop buyers of beneficiaries of the reform, leading agricultural harvests to plummet and rising discontent amongst Afghans.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&amp;pg=PA315 315]}} When Taraki realized the degree of popular dissatisfaction with the reform he began to curtail the policy.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|pp=315–316}} Afghanistan's long history of resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control further undermined his authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;MERIA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ishiyama, John |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue1/jv9no1a2.html |title=The Sickle and the Minaret: Communist Successor Parties in Yemen and Afghanistan after the Cold War |publisher=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]] | volume = 19 | number = 1 | date = March 2005 | accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, much of the land reform was not actually implemented nationwide. In the months following the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other policies that challenged both traditional [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghan values]] and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. The strength of the anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=356}}

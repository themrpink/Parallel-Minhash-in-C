In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for [[routing protocol|routing]] as its [[Convergence (routing)#Convergence time|time to converge]] and [[scale (computing)|scalability]] are poor compared to [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol|EIGRP]], [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]], or [[IS-IS]]. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters, unlike other protocols.

RIP uses the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved [[port number]] 520.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/|title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry|website=IANA|ref=https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?&amp;page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IANA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers | title= Port Numbers | accessdate = 25 May 2008 | date = 22 May 2008 |format= plain text |publisher= The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of distance-vector routing ==
Based on the [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]] and the [[Ford–Fulkerson algorithm]] distant-vector routing protocols started to be implemented from 1969 onwards in [[data networks]] such as the [[ARPANET]] and [[CYCLADES]]. The predecessor of RIP was the Gateway Information Protocol (GWINFO) which was developed by [[Xerox]] in the mid-1970s to route its experimental network. As part of the [[Xerox Network Systems]] (XNS) protocol suite GWINFO transformed into the XNS Routing Information Protocol. This XNS RIP in turn became the basis for early routing protocols, such as [[Novell]]'s IPX RIP, [[AppleTalk]]'s Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and the IP RIP. The 1982 [[Berkley Software Distribution]] of the [[UNIX]] operating system implemented RIP in the ''routed'' [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]. The 4.2BSD release proved popular and became the basis for subsequent UNIX versions, which implemented RIP in the ''routed'' or ''gated'' daemon. Ultimately RIP had been extensively deployed before the standard written by [[Charles Hedrick]] was passed as RIPv1 in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= CCIE Professional Development: Routing TCP/IP Volume I, Second Edition|authors =Jeff Doyle &amp; Jennifer Carroll |publisher= ciscopress.com|year=2005 |isbn= 9781587052026|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The RIP hop count==
The routing metric used by RIP counts the number of routers that need to be passed to reach a destination IP network. The hop count 0 denotes a network that is directly connected to the router. 16 hops denote a network that is unreachable, according to the RIP hop limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= CCIE Professional Development: Routing TCP/IP Volume I, Second Edition|authors =Jeff Doyle &amp; Jennifer Carroll |publisher= ciscopress.com|year=2005 |isbn= 9781587052026|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
There are three standardised versions of the Routing Information Protocol: ''RIPv1'' and ''RIPv2'' for [[IPv4]], and ''RIPng'' for [[IPv6]].

===RIP version 1===
The original specification of RIP, defined in RFC 1058, was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1058, ''Routing Information Protocol'', C. Hendrik, The Internet Society (June 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; When starting up, and every 30 seconds thereafter, a router with RIPv1 implementation [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcasts]] to 255.255.255.255 a request message through every RIPv1 enabled interface. Neighbouring routers receiving the request message respond with a RIPv1 segment, containing their [[routing table]]. The requesting router updates its own routing table, with the reachable IP network address, hop count and next hop, that is the router interface IP address from which the RIPv1 response was sent. As the requesting router receives updates from different neighbouring routers it will only update the reachable networks in its routing table, if it receives information about a reachable network it has not yet in its routing table or information that a network it has in its routing table is reachable with a lower hop count. Therefore, a RIPv1 router will in most cases only have one entry for a reachable network, the one with the lowest hop count. If a router receives information from two different neighbouring router that the same network is reachable with the same hop count but via two different routes, the network will be entered into the routing table two times with different next hop routers. The RIPv1 enabled router will then perform what is known as equal-cost load balancing for IP packets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt;

RIPv1 enabled routers not only request the routing tables of other routers every 30 seconds, they also listen to incoming requests from neighbouring routers and send their own routing table in turn. RIPv1 routing tables are therefore updated every 25 to 35 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt; The RIPv1 protocol adds a small random time variable to the update time, to avoid routing tables synchronising across a LAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= CCIE Professional Development: Routing TCP/IP Volume I, Second Edition|authors =Jeff Doyle &amp; Jennifer Carroll |publisher= ciscopress.com|year=2005 |isbn= 9781587052026|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought, as a result of random initialization, the routing updates would spread out in time, but this was not true in practice. Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson showed in 1994 that, without slight randomization of the update timer, the timers synchronized over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icir.org/floyd/papers/sync_94.pdf The Synchronization of Periodic Routing Messages], S. Floyd &amp; V. Jacobson,April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

RIPv1 can be configured into silent mode, so that a router requests and processes neighbouring routing tables, and keeps its routing table and hop count for reachable networks up to date, but does not needlessly send its own routing table into the network. Silent mode is commonly implemented to hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= CCIE Professional Development: Routing TCP/IP Volume I, Second Edition|authors =Jeff Doyle &amp; Jennifer Carroll |publisher= ciscopress.com|year=2005 |isbn= 9781587052026|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIPv1 uses [[classful address|classful]] routing. The periodic routing updates do not carry [[subnetwork|subnet]] information, lacking support for [[VLSM|variable length subnet masks]] (VLSM). This limitation makes it impossible to have different-sized [[subnetwork|subnet]]s inside of the same [[network class]]. In other words, all subnets in a network class must have the same size. There is also no support for router authentication, making RIP vulnerable to various attacks.

===RIP version 2===
Due to the deficiencies of the original RIP specification, RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed in 1993[4], published as RFC 1723 in 1994, and declared [[Internet Standard]] 56 in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc2453&quot;&gt;
{{Cite IETF|rfc=2453|std=56|title=RIP Version 2|author=G. Malkin|publisher=Network Working Group, [[IETF]]|date=November 1998}}, updated by RFC 4822&lt;/ref&gt; It included the ability to carry subnet information, thus supporting [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR). To maintain backward compatibility, the hop count limit of 15 remained. RIPv2 has facilities to fully interoperate with the earlier specification if all ''Must Be Zero'' protocol fields in the RIPv1 messages are properly specified. In addition, a ''compatibility switch'' feature&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc2453&quot; /&gt; allows fine-grained interoperability adjustments.

In an effort to avoid unnecessary load on hosts that do not participate in routing, RIPv2 ''[[multicast]]s'' the entire routing table to all adjacent routers at the address [[Multicast address|{{IPaddr|224.0.0.9}}]], as opposed to RIPv1 which uses [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]]. [[Unicast]] addressing is still allowed for special applications.

([[MD5]]) authentication for RIP was introduced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;
  RFC 2082, ''RIP-2 MD5 Authentication'', F. Baker, R. Atkinson, The Internet Society (January 1997)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  RFC 4822, ''RIPv2 Cryptographic Authentication'', R. Atkinson, M. Fanto, The Internet Society (January 2007)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Route tags were also added in RIP version 2. This functionality allows a distinction between routes learned from the RIP protocol and routes learned from other protocols.

===RIPng===
RIPng (RIP next generation), defined in RFC 2080,&lt;ref name=&quot;rfc2080&quot;&gt;{{Cite IETF|rfc=2080|title=RIPng for IPv6|author1=G. Malkin|author2=R. Minnear|publisher=Network Working Group, [[IETF]]|date=January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of RIPv2 for support of [[IPv6]], the next generation Internet Protocol. The main differences between RIPv2 and RIPng are:
* Support of IPv6 networking.
* While RIPv2 supports RIPv1 updates authentication, RIPng does not. IPv6 routers were, at the time, supposed to use [[IPsec]] for authentication.
* RIPv2 encodes the next-hop into each route entry, RIPng requires specific encoding of the next hop for a set of route entries.

RIPng sends updates on UDP port 521 using the multicast group {{IPaddr|FF02::9}}.

== RIP messages between routers ==
RIP messages use the [[User Datagram Protocol]] on port 520 and all RIP messages exchanged between routers are encapsulated in a UDP segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt;

===RIPv1 Messages===
RIP defined two types of messages:&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt; 
# Request Message: asking a neighbouring RIPv1 enabled router to send its routing table.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt;
# Response Message: carries the routing table of a router.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciscopress.com&quot;/&gt;

==Timers==
The routing information protocol uses the following timers as part of its operation:&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Balchunas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Balchunas|first=Aaron|title=Routing Information Protocol (RIP v1.03)|url=http://www.routeralley.com/guides/rip.pdf|publisher=routeralley.com.|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Update Timer: controls the interval between two gratuitous Response Messages. By default the value is 30 seconds. The response message is broadcast to all its RIP enabled interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Balchunas&quot;/&gt;
* Invalid Timer: The invalid timer specifies how long a routing entry can be in the routing table without being updated. This is also called as expiration Timer. By default, the value is 180 seconds. After the timer expires the hop count of the routing entry will be set to 16, marking the destination as unreachable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Balchunas&quot;/&gt;
* Flush Timer: The flush timer controls the time between the route is invalidated or marked as unreachable and removal of entry from the routing table. By default the value is 240 seconds. This is 60 seconds longer than Invalid timer.  So for 60 seconds the router will be advertising about this unreachable route to all its neighbours. This timer must be set to a higher value than the ''invalid timer.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Balchunas&quot;/&gt;
* Holddown Timer: The hold-down timer is started per route entry, when the hop count is changing from lower value to higher value. This allows the route to get stabilized. During this time no update can be done to that routing entry.  This is not part of the RFC 1058. This is [[Cisco Systems|Cisco's]] implementation.  The default value of this timer is 180 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Balchunas&quot;/&gt;

==Limitations==
* The hop count cannot exceed 15, or routes will be dropped.
* Variable Length Subnet Masks are not supported by RIP version 1 (which is obsolete).
* RIP has slow convergence and [[count to infinity]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1058|title=RFC 1058 Section 2.2|last=C. Hendrik|website=Routing Information Protocol|publisher=The Internet Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIP_2M is the standard RIPv2 implementation using multicasting - which requires all routers on the network to support RIPv2 and multicasting, whereas RIP_2B sends RIPv2 packets using subnet broadcasting - making it more compatible with routers that do not support multicasting, including RIPv1 routers.
* [[Huawei]] HG633 ADSL/VDSL routers support passive and active routing with RIP v1 &amp; v2 on the LAN and WAN side.

==Similar protocols==
[[Cisco]]'s proprietary [[Interior Gateway Routing Protocol]] (IGRP) was a somewhat more capable protocol than RIP. It belongs to the same basic family of [[distance-vector routing protocol]]s. Cisco has ceased support and distribution of IGRP in their router software. It was replaced by the [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol]] (EIGRP) which is a completely new design. While EIGRP still uses a distance-vector model, it relates to IGRP only in using the same routing metrics. IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Network delay|delay]], [[Load (computing)|load]], [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliability]].

'''Erich Dagobert von Drygalski'''{{Need-IPA|German}} (February 9, 1865 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1949) was a German [[geographer]], [[geophysicist]] and polar scientist, born in [[Königsberg]], then under the [[Province of Prussia]].

Between 1882 and 1887, Drygalski studied [[mathematics]] and [[natural science]] at the [[University of Königsberg]], [[Bonn]], [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]]. He graduated with a doctorate thesis about ice shields in Nordic areas. Between 1888 and 1891, he was an assistant at the [[Geodesy|Geodetic]] Institute and the Central Office of International Geodetics in Berlin. 

Drygalski led two expeditions between 1891 and 1893, which were supplied by the Society for [[Geoscience]] of Berlin. One expedition wintered during the winter between 1892 and 1893 in Western [[Greenland]]. He [[Habilitation|habilitated]] 1889 for geography and geophysics with the collected scientific evidence. In 1898, Drygalski became [[associate professor]] and 1899 extraordinary professor for [[geography]] and [[geophysics]] in Berlin.

== ''Gauss'' expedition ==
{{Main|Gauss expedition}}
[[Image:Gauss corp2854.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The ''Gauss'' enclosed in the ice. Photo taken from a balloon, the first [[aerial photography]] in Antarctica]]
Drygalski led the first German [[South Pole|South Polar]] expedition with the ship ''Gauss'' to explore the unknown area of [[Antarctica]] lying south of the [[Kerguelen Islands]]. The expedition started from [[Kiel]] in the summer of 1901. A small party of the expedition was also stationed on the Kerguelen Islands, while the main party proceeded further south. Drygalski also paid a brief call to [[Heard Island]] and provided the first comprehensive scientific information on the island's geology, flora and fauna. Despite being trapped by ice for nearly fourteen months until February 1903, the expedition discovered new territory in [[Antarctica]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]] with the [[Gaussberg]]. The expedition arrived back in Kiel in November 1903. Subsequently, Drygalski wrote the narrative of the expedition and edited the voluminous scientific data. Between 1905 and 1931, he published twenty [[Volume (disambiguation)|volumes]] and two [[atlas]]es documenting the expedition and was awarded the 1933 [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=24 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==
From October 1906 until his retirement, Drygalski was a professor in [[Munich]], where he also presided the Geographic Institute, founded by him, until his death. In 1910, he also took part in Count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s expedition to [[Svalbard|Spitsbergen]] and participated in other expeditions to [[North America]] and northeastern [[Asia]]. He died 1949 in Munich.

== Trivia ==
[[Drygalski Island]], [[Drygalski Fjord]] in South Georgia, and an avenue in the southern part of Munich were named after him, as is the crater [[Drygalski (crater)|Drygalski]] on the Moon. Two glaciers, including [[Drygalski Glacier (Antarctica)]] and [[Drygalski Glacier (Tanzania)]] on the slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] are also named for him. An archive in the [[Ludwig Maximilians University]] remembers his pioneering efforts. He also has a South African spider named after him, ''[[Araneus drygalskii]]'' (Strand, 1909), based on material collected on the Gauss expedition.

'''Alfred North Whitehead''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|FRS|FBA}} (15 February 1861&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1947) was an English [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]].  He is best known as the defining figure of the [[philosophical school]] known as [[process philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including [[ecology]], [[theology]], [[education]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[economics]], and [[psychology]], among other areas.

In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[physics]]. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), which he wrote with former student [[Bertrand Russell]]. ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in [[mathematical logic]], and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;&quot;The Modern Library's Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the Century&quot;, last modified 30 April 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'', accessed 21 November 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/library/books/042999best-nonfiction-list.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to [[philosophy of science]], and finally to [[metaphysics]]. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of [[Western philosophy]]. Whitehead argued that [[reality]] consists of [[Event (philosophy)|processes]] rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertMesle&quot;&gt;[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process-Relational Philosophy: An Introduction to Alfred North Whitehead'' (West Conshohocken: Templeton Foundation Press, 2009), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Whitehead's philosophical works&amp;nbsp;– particularly ''[[Process and Reality]]''&amp;nbsp;– are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.

Whitehead's process philosophy argues that &quot;there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertMesle&quot; /&gt; For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of [[ecological civilization]] and [[environmental ethics]] pioneered by [[John B. Cobb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilipRose&quot;&gt;Philip Rose, ''On Whitehead'' (Belmont: Wadsworth, 2002), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Putting Philosophy to Work&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb |first1=John B., Jr. |last2=Schwartz |first2=Wm.

==Life==
===Childhood and education===
[[File:cmglee Cambridge Trinity College Whewells Court.jpg|thumb|left|Whewell's Court north range at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge]].  Whitehead spent thirty years at Trinity, five as a student and twenty-five as a senior lecturer.]]
Alfred North Whitehead was born in [[Ramsgate]], [[Kent]], England, in 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe_c&quot;&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Alfred Whitehead, was a minister and schoolmaster of [[Chatham House Grammar School|Chatham House Academy]], a school for boys established by Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe&quot;&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schools, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man.&lt;ref name=&quot;VictorLowe&quot; /&gt; Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's brother [[Henry Whitehead (bishop)|Henry]] became [[Anglican Bishop of Madras|Bishop of Madras]], and wrote the closely observed ethnographic account ''Village Gods of South-India'' (Calcutta: Association Press, 1921).

Whitehead was educated at [[Sherborne School]], [[Dorset]], one of the best [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was described as over-protected,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; but when at school he excelled in sports and mathematics&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 54–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and was head [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] of his class.&lt;ref name= &quot;VictorLowe_a&quot;&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Whitehead began attending [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and studied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; His academic advisor was [[Edward Routh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mathgenealogy|id=101929&quot;&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=101929}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his B.A. from Trinity in 1884, and graduated as fourth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity in 1884, and marrying Evelyn in 1890, Whitehead would teach and write on [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his ''Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, [[Bertrand Russell]], on the first edition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;On Whitehead the mathematician and logician, see [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870–1940: Logics, Set Theories, and the Foundations of Mathematics from Cantor through Russell to Gödel'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000), and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s chapter in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp|Paul Schilpp]], ''The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (New York: Tudor Publishing Company, 1941), 125–163.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1907.  Russell was a student of Whitehead's at Trinity College, and a longtime collaborator and friend.]]
In 1910, Whitehead resigned his senior lectureship in mathematics at Trinity and moved to London without first obtaining another job.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After being unemployed for a year, he accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at [[University College London]], but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which he had hoped to be seriously considered.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Whitehead accepted a position as professor of applied mathematics at the newly chartered [[Imperial College London]], where his old friend [[Andrew Forsyth]] had recently been appointed chief professor of mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor Lowe 1990&quot;&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the [[University of London]] system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor Lowe 1990&quot;/&gt; Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

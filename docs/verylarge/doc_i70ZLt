[[File:Britskorthaar-64091287828362D7bA.jpg|thumb|right|A fully mature British Blue male, showing the characteristic heavy jowls and unique &quot;crisp&quot; texture of the coat]]

The British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking large cat, having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep coppery orange in the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAstandard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfainc.org/Portals/0/documents/breeds/standards/british.pdf|title=British Shorthair Breed Standard|publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association|work=www.cfainc.org|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Blue variant can often be confused with the grey [[Scottish Fold]]. However, the Shorthair can be characterised by having its pointy triangle ears, whereas the Fold has softer, folded ears.

They are slow to mature in comparison with most cat breeds, reaching full physical development at approximately three years of age. Unusually among domestic cats they are a noticeably sexually dimorphic breed, with males averaging {{convert|9|–|17|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|7|–|12|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAintro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfainc.org/Breeds/BreedsAB/BritishShorthair.aspx |title=CFA: Introduction to the British Shorthair |work=www.cfainc.org |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tica.org/en/cat-breeds/item/190-british-shorthair-introduction The International Cat Association – British Shorthair]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coat, colour, and patterns ===

The British Shorthair's coat is one of the breed's defining features. It is very dense but does not have an undercoat; thus, the texture is plush rather than woolly or fluffy, with a firm, &quot;crisp&quot; pile that breaks noticeably over the cat's body as it moves.&lt;ref name=&quot;TICAstandard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tica.org/en/cat-breeds/item/190-british-shorthair-introduction|title=British Shorthair|work=The International Cat Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031000536/http://www.tica.org/en/cat-breeds/item/190-british-shorthair-introduction|archive-date=October 31, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAstandard&quot; /&gt;

Although the British Blue remains the most familiar variant, British Shorthairs have been developed in many other colours and patterns. Black, blue, white, red, cream, silver, golden and—most recently—cinnamon and fawn are accepted by all official standards, either solid or in [[Colorpoint Shorthair|colourpoint]], [[Tabby cat|tabby]], shaded and [[Bicolor cat|bicolour]] patterns; the GCCF, FIFe and TICA also accept chocolate and its dilute lilac, disallowed in the CFA standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;GCCFstandard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishshorthairbac.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/breeding-policy_sep12.pdf |title=GCCF: British Shorthair breeding policy |publisher=Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (UK) |work=www.gccfcats.org |date=12 Sep 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814095116/http://britishshorthairbac.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/breeding-policy_sep12.pdf |archive-date=14 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; All colours and patterns also have [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAstandard&quot; /&gt;

The Tabby patterns include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gccfcats.org/Portals/0/BritishSH.SOP.pdf|title=British Shorthair General Type Standard|date=2018|website=Gccfcats.org|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic Tabby, Mackerel Tabby, Spotted &amp; Ticked Tabby. The non-tabby patterns include: Tortoiseshell, Bi-Colour, Van patterns Bi-Colour &amp; White, Smoke, Tipped &amp; Colourpointed.

=== Temperament ===
They are an easygoing and dignified breed, not as active and playful as many but sweet-natured and devoted to their owners, making them a favourite of animal trainers. They tend to be safe around other pets and children since they will tolerate a fair amount of physical interaction, but as a rule do not like to be picked up or carried. They require only minimal grooming and take well to being kept as indoor-only cats; however, they can be prone to obesity unless care is taken with their diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;TICAstandard&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAintro&quot; /&gt;

The UK breed committee considers the British Shorthair a long-lived cat, with a life expectancy of 14–20 years.&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Breeding Policy for the British Shorthair|url=http://britishshorthairbac.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/breeding-policy_sep12.pdf|publisher=British Shorthair Breed Advisory Committee|accessdate=2 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814095116/http://britishshorthairbac.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/breeding-policy_sep12.pdf|archive-date=14 August 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vet clinic data from England shows a median lifespan of 11.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1098612X14536176 |title=Longevity and mortality of cats attending primary care veterinary practices in England |journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery |date=2014 |first=D.

[[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HCM) can be a problem in the breed. A Danish prevalence study with more than 329 cats showed that 20.4% of males and 2.1% of the females had HCM. On top of this 6.4% of males and 3.5% of females were judged to be equivocal.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0751.x&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Granström |first1=S. |last2=Nyberg Godiksen |first2=M.

The breed is thought to be at high risk of [[polycystic kidney disease]] (PKD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): Gene test and negative register|url=http://www.icatcare.org:8080/advice/cat-health/polycystic-kidney-disease-pkd-gene-test-and-negative-register-0|publisher=International Cat Care|accessdate=2 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102081409/http://www.icatcare.org:8080/advice/cat-health/polycystic-kidney-disease-pkd-gene-test-and-negative-register-0|archive-date=2 November 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA test lab has noted a significant decrease of the PKD mutations in tested populations.

'''Potential Health Problems'''

[[Polycystic kidney disease]]

This disease forms a cyst in the cat's kidney, causing organ failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=What to know if you’re buying a… British Shorthair cat|url=https://www.petplan.co.uk/pet-information/blog/what-to-know-if-youre-buying-british-shorthair-cat-facts-temperament-health-illness/|access-date=2020-10-12|website=www.petplan.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;Polycystic kidney disease can be detected through genetic testing or ultrasound. There is no cure for polycystic kidney disease but there are drugs that can alleviate the effects and its advancement. 

[[Cardiomyopathy]]

The heart muscle thickens which limits the amount of blood that is pumped, leading to blood clots and health failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;Cardiomyopathy can be detected through ultrasound, EEG, and x-ray. Drugs can alleviate and slow down the advancement of the disease.

'''Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|ɡ|w|ɔːr|t|s}}) is a fictional British [[boarding school]] of [[Magic in Harry Potter|magic]] for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cleave, Maureen |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/0799-telegraph-cleave.html |via=Accio-quote.com |title=Wizard with Words |work=Telegraph Magazine |date=3 July 1999 |accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wohlberg2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Wohlberg|title=Hour of the Witch: Harry Potter, Wicca Witchcraft, and the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQ-4_ane91IC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=31 July 2011|date=April 2005|publisher=Destiny Image Publishers|isbn=978-0-7684-2279-5|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogwarts school was voted as the 36th best Scottish educational establishment in a 2008 online ranking, outranking Edinburgh's [[Loretto School]]. According to a director of the Independent Schools Network Rankings, it was added to the schools listing &quot;for fun&quot; and was then voted on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/jkrowlingharrypotter/Harry-Potter39s-school-outranks-Loretto.3929807.jp Harry Potter School Outranks Loretto], ''The Scotsman''&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is depicted as having numerous charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a [[Muggle]] to locate it. Muggles cannot see the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of danger.{{GF|ch=11}} The castle's setting is described as having extensive grounds with sloping lawns, flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a [[loch]] (called The Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the [[#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]), several [[greenhouse]]s and other outbuildings, and a full-size [[Quidditch#Pitches|Quidditch pitch]]. There is also an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and those owned by students.

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Hermione indicates that due to the high levels of magic, &quot;substitutes for magic (that) Muggles use&quot; such as computers, radar and electricity &quot;go haywire&quot; around Hogwarts. Radios however, make an exception. Rowling explains this by saying that the radios are not powered by electricity but by magic.

Hogwarts is on the shore of a lake, sometimes called the Black Lake. In that lake are [[merman|merpeople]], [[Grindylow]]s, and a [[Kraken|giant squid]]. The giant squid does not attack humans and sometimes acts as a [[lifeguard]] when students are in the lake.

Hogwarts is a [[coeducation]]al, secondary [[boarding school]], taking children from ages eleven to eighteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wohlberg2005&quot; /&gt; Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated in the seventh book.

==Admission==
According to the novels, admission to Hogwarts is selective, in that children who show magical ability will automatically gain a place,&lt;ref name=&quot;jkrowlingcom_id91&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=91 |title=J.K.Rowling Official Site |page=F.A.Q. – About the Books |quote=Everyone who shows magical ability before their eleventh birthday will automatically gain a place at Hogwarts; there is no question of not being 'magical enough'; you are either magical or you are not. |accessdate=2 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828105536/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=91|archivedate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Squibs|squibs]] cannot attend the school as students (though they can work there in other roles, as [[Argus Filch]] does).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 |title=J.K.Rowling Official Site |page=Extras – Miscellaneous |quote=Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. |accessdate=2 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208051328/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19|archivedate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magical quill at Hogwarts detects the birth of magical children and writes their names into a large parchment book,&lt;ref name=&quot;Accio-quote.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm |title=Accio-quote.org |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=3 February 2000 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no [[Secondary School Admission Test|admission test]] because &quot;you are either magical or you are not.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jkrowlingcom_id91&quot;/&gt; Every year, a teacher checks this book and sends a letter to the children who are turning eleven. Acceptance or refusal of a place at Hogwarts must be posted by 31 July. The letter also contains a list of supplies like spell books, uniform, and other things that the student will need. The prospective student is expected to buy all the necessary materials, normally from shops in [[Diagon Alley]], a concealed street near [[Charing Cross Road]] in London that can be found behind the wizarding pub, The Leaky Cauldron. Students who cannot afford their supplies can receive financial aid from the school, as happened with the young orphan [[Lord Voldemort|Tom Riddle]].

Letters to [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] witches and wizards, who may not be aware of their powers and are unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, are delivered in person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explains to the parents or guardians about magical society, and reassures them regarding this news.{{HP7}}

Though the school is in [[Great Britain]], its [[catchment area]] is the wider [[British Isles]], as Irish students can also attend.

Each student is allowed to bring an owl, a cat or a toad. Along with the acceptance letter, first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes a wand, subject books, a standard size 2 pewter cauldron, a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope (for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of protective gloves, and a black winter cloak with silver fastenings. Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag. First years are not allowed a [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomstick]] of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry in his first year after he demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in [[Quidditch]].

==Arrival==
The primary mode of transport to Hogwarts is the [[Hogwarts Express]] that students take at the start of each school year. Students board the train from the also fictional and hidden [[Platform 9¾]] at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London. The train arrives near Hogwarts, some time after nightfall.

From there, first-year students are accompanied by the &quot;Keeper of the Keys, Game and Grounds&quot; (which was Hagrid during the first novel) to small boats, which magically sail across the lake and get them near the entrance of Hogwarts. The older students ride up to the castle in carriages pulled by creatures called [[Thestrals]]. When the first-year students initially arrive at the castle, they wait in a small chamber off the entrance hall until the older students have taken their seats, and then enter the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony to determine their House assignments. As Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]] said in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', &quot;The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.&quot;
After the [[Sorting Hat]] sings a song, each student in turn is seated upon the stool in front of the rest of the student body. The Hat is placed on the student's head, whereupon it examines his or her mind and assigns them to one of the four Houses based on abilities, personality, and preferences. After the Sorting Ceremony, the students and teachers enjoy a feast, prepared by the Hogwarts [[House-elf|house-elves]]. If Dumbledore is feeling cheerful, he will lead the students in singing the school song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowling|first=JK|title=FAQ – We haven't heard the school song since the first book.

==Houses==

[[File:Coat of arms Hogwart with motto.svg|thumb| Coat of arm of Hogwarts]]
Hogwarts is divided into four [[House system|houses]], each bearing the last name of its founder: [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Salazar Slytherin]], [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] and [[Helga Hufflepuff]]. Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses. Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students. Each house is under the authority of one of the [[Hogwarts staff]] members. The Heads of the houses, as they are called, are in charge of giving their students important information, dealing with matters of severe punishment, and responding to emergencies in their houses, among other things. Each year, year level groups of every separate house share the same dormitory and classes. The dormitory and common room of a House are, barring rare exceptions, inaccessible to students belonging to other Houses.

In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders hand-picked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in [[Slytherin]] in the first book, but ultimately selecting [[Gryffindor]] after Harry asks it not to put him in Slytherin.

The translators of the books' foreign editions had difficulty translating the &quot;house&quot; concept; in countries where this system does not exist, no word could adequately convey the importance of belonging to a house, the loyalty owed to it, and the pride taken in prizes won by the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;russian&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Meta Translators' Journal]] | title = From Harry to Garri: Strategies for the Transfer of Culture and Ideology in Russian Translations of Two English Fantasy Stories | author=Judith Inggshttp | volume = 48 | issue = 1–2 Traduction pour les enfants / Translation for children | date = May 2003 | pages = 285–297 | doi=10.7202/006975ar | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gryffindorcolours.svg|32px|left]]

===Gryffindor ===
'''Gryffindor''' values courage, bravery, nerve, and chivalry. Gryffindor's mascot is the lion, and its colours are scarlet red and gold (maroon and gold on the ties and scarves). During the books, the Head of this house is the [[#Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] Professor and Deputy Headmistress, [[Minerva McGonagall]] until she becomes headmistress, and the house [[Ghosts (Harry Potter)|ghost]] is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, more commonly known as [[Nearly Headless Nick]]. According to Rowling, Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. The founder of the house is Godric Gryffindor.

The Gryffindor common room is in one of the castle's highest towers, and its entrance is on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a painting of [[The Fat Lady]], who is garbed in a pink dress. She permits entry only after being given the correct password, as was established in the third book, when Sirius Black tried forcing entry into the tower, only to be blocked by The Fat Lady after he could not give the correct password. In the first book, Neville Longbottom tends to forget the password and must wait near the painting until other Gryffindors arrive to open the way.&lt;ref&gt;Rowling, J.K. ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'', Ch. 9, p. 156. Scholastic: 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hufflepuff colours.svg|32px|left]]

===Hufflepuff===
'''Hufflepuff''' values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black (or golden yellow and graphite in the ''[[Fantastic Beasts]]'' films) are its colours. During the books, the Head of this house is the [[Herbology]] Professor [[Pomona Sprout]], and the house ghost is [[the Fat Friar]]. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff.

The entrance to the Hufflepuff dormitories and common room entrance is concealed in a pile of large barrels in an alcove in the corridor that holds the kitchen. To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom in the middle of the second row in the rhythm of &quot;Helga Hufflepuff&quot;. Unlike any other house, the Hufflepuff common room has a repelling device that douses the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped or the rhythm is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|authorlink=J. K. Rowling|title=Hufflepuff Common Room|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hufflepuff-common-room|work=[[Pottermore]]|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hufflepuff common room is filled with yellow hangings and fat armchairs and it has little tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops.&lt;ref name=webchat&gt;{{cite web|author=Melissa |url=http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=J.K. Rowling Web Chat Transcript |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ravenclawcolours.svg|32px|left]]

===Ravenclaw===
'''Ravenclaw''' values intelligence, learning, wisdom and wit.{{HP5}}{{HP7}} The house mascot is an eagle and the house colours are blue and bronze (blue and silver in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Beasts]]'' films and on the ties and scarves). During the books, the head of this house is the [[#Charms|Charms]] teacher, Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], and the house ghost is [[Helena Ravenclaw|the Grey Lady]]. According to Rowling, Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of [[Air (classical element)|air]]. The founder of this house is Rowena Ravenclaw.

The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, on the west side of Hogwarts. The common room is round and filled with blue hangings and armchairs, has a domed ceiling painted with stars and features a replica statue of Rowena wearing her [[diadem]]. Harry also notes that Ravenclaws &quot;have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains&quot;. A logical riddle must be solved to gain entry, whereas the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms only require a password (Hufflepuffs need to tap a barrel in the rhythm of &quot;Helga Hufflepuff&quot;), indicating that it may be easier for those students from other houses who possess a high degree of intelligence to enter this common room than others. Professor McGonagall, the head of the Gryffindor House, solves the riddle accurately.[[File:Slytherin colours.svg|32px|left]]

===Slytherin===
'''Slytherin''' values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness; the Sorting Hat said in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' that Slytherins will do anything to get their way. The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colours are green and silver.  Throughout the series, until the seventh book, the Head of House is Professor [[Severus Snape]]. Then, the previous Head of House Professor [[Horace Slughorn]] comes out of retirement, re-assuming authority after Snape becomes headmaster. The ghost of Slytherin house is [[The Bloody Baron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Three] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024931/http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview3.shtml |date=11 October 2007 }} ''MuggleNet'' Retrieved on 2 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of [[Water (classical element)|water]]. The founder of this house is Salazar Slytherin.

The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached by speaking a password to a patch of bare stone wall in the dungeons, which causes a hidden door to open. The Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book as having a greenish glow.

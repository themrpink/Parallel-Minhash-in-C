==Population==
{{Table Population Town}}
{{as of|2017}}, the metropolitan area (''[[unité urbaine]]'') of Nice, defined by INSEE, is home to 942,886 inhabitants (sixth most populous in France) and its urban area (''[[aire urbaine]]'') totals 1,006,201 inhabitants, which makes it the seventh largest in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=COM-06088+UU2010-06701+AU2010-007 Comparateur de territoire: Commune de Nice (06088), Unité urbaine de Nice (06701), Aire urbaine de Nice (007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nice vietnamese restaurant 3630.JPG|thumb|Nice residents of [[Vietnam]]ese descent stand in front of one of the many Vietnamese restaurants of the city.]]

Since the 1970s, the number of inhabitants has not changed significantly; the relatively high migration to Nice is balanced by a natural negative growth of the population.

==Observatory==
[[File:Coupole Bischoffsheim.jpg|thumb|View of the Bischoffsheim cupola, the main cupola of [[Nice Observatory]]]]
The ''Observatoire de Nice'' ([[Nice Observatory]]) is located on the summit of Mont Gros. The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Raphaël Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.

The 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.

==Culture==
Terra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located. It is an archaeological site with treasures, of which only a small part has been excavated. The excavated site includes thermal baths, arenas and Roman road.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Since the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]],  [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.

Nice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Musée Marc Chagall]], [[Musée Matisse (Nice)|Musée Matisse]] (arenas of Cimiez containing Roman ruins), [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky]], Musée Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] which devotes much space to the well-known '' École of Nice ''”), Museum of Natural History, Musée Masséna, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.

Being a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].

Nice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Niçard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than to other extant Provençal dialects.

In the past, Nice welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former Northern and Western African colonies, as well as southeast Asia{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] – an open-chain community dance.

Since 1860 a cannon (based at the Château east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice – French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''.

===Cuisine===
The cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provence]] but also [[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].

Nice has a few local dishes. There is a local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named &quot;[[Pissaladière]]&quot;. ''[[Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis niçois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade niçoise]]'' is a tomato salad with green peppers of the &quot;Corne&quot; variety, baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, and olives.

Local meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, and anchovies (alevins) are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: &quot;fish are born in the sea and die in oil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin UK|year=2010|isbn=9780141929927|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Niçois specialties include:
* ''[[Beignets de fleurs de courgettes]]''
* ''[[Ratatouille]]''
* ''[[Pichade]]''
* ''[[Pissaladière]]''
* ''[[Pan-bagnat]]''

==History==
''The Register'' was founded in [[London]] as an email newsletter called ''Chip Connection''. In 1998 ''The Register'' became a daily online news source. Magee left in 2001 to start competing publications ''[[The Inquirer]]'', and later the ''[[IT Examiner]]'' and ''[[TechEye]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;Walsh, Bob (2007). ''Clear Blogging: How People Blogging Are Changing the World and How You Can Join Them.'' Apress, {{ISBN|9781590596913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ''The Register'' expanded to have a presence in London and [[San Francisco]], creating ''The Register USA'' at theregus.com through a joint venture with'' [[Tom's Hardware]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cullen2002&quot;&gt;Cullen, Drew (25 February 2002). [http://www.theregister.com/2002/02/25/the_register_comes/ The Register Comes to the US.] ''The Register''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, that site moved to theregister.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;cullen2003&quot;&gt;Cullen, Drew (24 February 2003).

==Intel chips flaw investigation==
{{Further|Intel_Atom#Issues}}

On 6 February 2017, ''The Register'' was the first news outlet to accurately trace a recently discovered flaw in Cisco (and other makers) gear to a serious defect on [[Intel]]'s Atom C2000 series processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Thomas Claburn | publisher=The Register | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/06/cisco_intel_decline_to_link_product_warning_to_faulty_chip/ | title=FYI: Intel's Atom C2000 chips are bricking products – and it's not just Cisco hit | date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Meltdown (security vulnerability)|Spectre (security vulnerability)}}
Around 3 January 2018, ''The Register'' broke news about Google's long-ongoing investigation into Intel's processor design, which revealed that a serious flaw in the design of their chips would require Microsoft, Linux and Apple to update operating systems for computers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42553818|title=Major flaw in millions of Intel chips|last=Wakefield|first=Jane|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=20 January 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706013820/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42553818|archive-date=6 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edmund Ironside''' (c. 990{{snd}}30 November 1016; {{Lang-ang|Ēadmund}}, {{Lang-la|Edmundus}}; sometimes also known as '''Edmund II'''{{efn|Numbers were not used to identify kings until well after the Norman Conquest of 1066, so their use to identify Anglo-Saxon kings is anachronistic. However, since Edmund I is usually identified as such, Edmund Ironside is sometimes referred to in the same manner.}}) was [[King of the English]] from 23 April to 30 November 1016. He was the son of King [[Æthelred the Unready]] and his first wife, [[Ælfgifu of York]]. Edmund's reign was marred by a war he had inherited from his father; his [[cognomen]] &quot;Ironside&quot; was given to him &quot;because of his valour&quot; in resisting the Danish invasion led by [[Cnut the Great]].{{sfn|Lawson|2004}}

Edmund was not expected to be King of England; however, by June 1014 two elder brothers had died, making him [[heir apparent]]. England was conquered by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] at the end of the same year, but he died shortly thereafter, paving the way for Æthelred to return to the throne, which he did, but not without opposition. Sweyn's son, Cnut, was defeated and returned to [[Denmark]], where he assembled an invasion force to re-conquer England. It would not arrive for another year.

After regaining the throne, the royal family set about strengthening its hold on the country with the assistance of [[Eadric Streona]] (Edmund's brother in law). People who had sided with the Danes in 1014 were punished, and some were killed. In one case, two brothers, [[Morcar (thegn)|Morcar]] and [[Sigeferth (died 1015)|Sigeferth]], were killed and their possessions were taken by Æthelred. Sigeferth's widow  [[Ealdgyth (wife of Edmund Ironside)|Ealdgyth]] was imprisoned within a monastery, but she had already captured Edmund's attention. Cnut returned to England in August 1015. Over the next few months, Cnut pillaged most of England. Edmund joined Æthelred to defend [[London]], but in 1016 Edmund unofficially named himself the Earl of the East Midlands and raised a revolt against his father. Without the king's permission he took Ealdgyth from the monastery, and married her; it would have been a politically advantageous marriage, since she was a member of one of the strongest families in the Midlands.

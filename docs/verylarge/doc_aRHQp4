===Fiat Argentina===
Fiat has been present in Argentina since the beginning of the 20th century. There was a Fiat manufacturing plant in Córdoba at least as far back as 1954 when Fiat entered into a joint venture with two local companies to manufacture tractors. The company was known as Fiat-Concord until 1980. In 1959 the construction of a car plant in [[Caseros, Buenos Aires|Caseros]] was approved, and 1960 saw the production there of the first Argentinian produced Fiat passenger car, a [[Fiat 600]], after the [[Fiat 1100]] Export and after in 1963 the [[Fiat 1300/1500|Fiat 1500]]. In 1977 appears the Fiat 133, just a rebadged Seat 133 but made in Argentina. By 1978 a car manufacturing facility was well established in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], producing [[Fiat 128]]s as well as two models which from the Italian perspective belonged in earlier decades, the [[Fiat 125|125]] (with some derivates) and the [[Fiat 600|600R]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoMotoruSport1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bunte Mischung: Wo und welche Fiat-Modelle in aller Welt produziert werden | journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=7 |page=15 |date=29 March 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 a joint venture with [[PSA Group|PSA]] called [[Sevel Argentina S.A.]] was begun, which lasted until 1995. The current day automobile manufacturing started with a new factory opened in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] on 20 December 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto-historia.com.ar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autohistoria.com.ar/Historias/Fiat_Argentina.htm|title=Historia de Fiat en Argentina|language=es|access-date=21 May 2009|work=auto-historia.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 1997 the Siena and Palio models production started.

Production was suspended in the early 2000s as the Argentinean economy went downhill. In 2008 Fiat invested new money and the production of Fiat Siena saloon and the Fiat Palio was started. In October 2009, a Fiat Siena HLX becomes the 2 million unit produced by Fiat in Argentina. The Fiat Auto Argentina S.A. is Fiat S.p.A. owned company.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com/article&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN3046210520070530|title=Fiat Argentina to resume production of own model|access-date=21 May 2009|work=Reuters |date=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiat Automobili Srbija===
Its first enterprise came in 1955, when it agreed to a deal with [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] carmaker [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] to assemble Fiats for Eastern Europe. The first cars produced by Zastava were its versions of the [[Fiat 1300]] and [[Fiat 1400]]. By 1970, Zastava was producing parts for the newer [[Fiat 124]] and [[Fiat 125]] models, which were assembled in Poland. The [[Zastava 750]], launched in 1962, was Zastava's version of the iconic [[Fiat 600]] [[City car|minicar]]. It outlived the car on which it was based, with production lasting until 1981. Zastavas were not popular outside of Eastern Europe before the 1980s, although they were exported to the US and several European countries under the Yugo brand during the 1980s.

The most famous product launched by Zastava is the [[Zastava 101]], a front-wheel drive car based on the [[Fiat 128]], also available as a [[hatchback]] version never sold in Italy. With the demise of the [[Zastava 750]] in 1981, the minicar gap in the Zastava range was filled by the [[Zastava Koral]], which was best known in Britain and America as the Yugo Tempo or Yugo 45/55. It was based on the 1971 [[Fiat 127]], which was due to be replaced by the [[Fiat Uno]] in 1983. Hostility towards Yugoslavia in the wake of the 1992 civil unrest saw a swift ending of imports to both Britain and America. The Zastava factory in [[Kragujevac]] was later bombed, but was rebuilt after the war ended, and production continued at another factory in [[Kragujevac]].

In 1987, Zastava came up with a new car design. The [[Yugo Florida|Zastava Florida]] — also known as a Yugo, and in other markets as the Yugo Sana — was styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] at the [[ItalDesign]] studio, later featured a range of more modern [[Peugeot]] engines. Sales continued in its homeland, with an update at the end of the 1990s. Zastava did not launch another new car for another 16 years. The 2003 [[Zastava 10]] model was another Fiat design—this time the second generation [[Fiat Punto#Mark 2|Punto]], and in 2009 was renamed Fiat Punto Classic

A new memorandum of understanding between Fiat and the Serb ministry of economic and regional development about the acquisition of Zastava's Kragujevac plant in 2008 led to a new company being set up in which the Italians would have a 70 percent stake and the Serb government 30 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes.com/feeds&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/04/30/afx4951532.html |title=Fiat signs agreement with Serb govt to acquire Zastava's Kragujevac plant |access-date=21 October 2009 |work=forbes.com/feeds |date=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019041914/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/04/30/afx4951532.html |archive-date=19 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory was renamed from &quot;Zastava Automobili Srbija&quot; to &quot;Fiat Automobili Srbija&quot;. In 2010 and 2011, FAS (Fiat Automobili Srbija) underwent large-scale reconstruction for production of the [[Fiat 500L]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiat opens 500L production line in Serbia|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/serbia-fiat-idUSL6E8FGAXC20120416|work=Reuters|access-date=24 July 2012|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polski Fiat/FSO (Poland)===
{{main|Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych}}
[[File:Fiat500126.JPG|thumb|Fiat 500 and 126]]
Fiat automobiles have been made in Poland since 1920. In 1932, the [[Polski Fiat|Polskie Zakłady Inżynieryjne (Polish Engineering Works, PZInż)]] started the production of [[Fiat 508]], produced until 1939 also as a military vehicle. In 1936 the licence was extended to include the [[Fiat 518]] model. In 1965, the Polish communist government signed a deal with Fiat to produce selected Fiat models in Poland at the [[Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych|FSO]] factory in [[Warsaw]] that had been built in 1951. Production of the new car—the [[Polski Fiat 125p]]—began in 1967. It was visually identical to the [[Fiat 125]], but it made use of older Fiat mechanicals which dated back to 1960. The car sold well in its homeland and was soon exported to Western Europe. 1978 saw the appearance of a new five-door hatchback, the [[FSO Polonez]], that made use of Fiat 125p [[running gear]]. After 1982, Fiat withdrew its licence; since then FSO badge was reinstated with the [[Polski Fiat 125p]] surviving until 1991, and the Polonez production ending in 2002. FSO was taken over by [[Daewoo]] of South Korea in 1995, and become independent again in late 2000, after Daewoo went bankrupt and was taken over by General Motors.

[[Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych]] (FSM) in [[Bielsko-Biała]] and [[Tychy]] was a joint venture between FSO and Fiat, and manufactured the [[Fiat 126p#Polski Fiat 126p|Fiat 126(p)]] in 1973 and the [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]] in 1991. In 1992 Fiat owned 90% of FSM (called Fiat Auto Poland, since 1993) and since then it produced [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]], [[Fiat Uno|Uno]], [[Fiat Seicento|Seicento]], [[Fiat Siena|Siena]] and [[Fiat Palio Weekend|Palio Weekend]] models with the capacity up to 200.000 cars a year. In 2003, FSM become the sole producer of [[Fiat Panda]], and in 2007, the [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]] and the related [[Ford Ka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Ka|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/ford/ka/road-test/1.2-zetec|work=Top Gear|access-date=30 January 2014|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacity was increased with production reaching over 600,000 in 2009, but dropped below 300,000 in 2013, resulting in the workforce being cut by a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/fiat-poland-idUSL5E8N790J20121207 |title=UPDATE 2-Fiat Poland to slash workforce as slack demand bites |date=7 December 2012 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AutoVAZ Lada (Russia)===
{{Main|Lada}} 
In 1966, Fiat helped [[USSR]] state industries build a new car factory ([[AvtoVAZ]]) on the [[Volga]] river. A planned city called [[Tolyatti]] (named after [[Palmiro Togliatti]], former [[Italian Communist Party]] [[General Secretary|Secretary]]) was developed around the factory, which started producing a &quot;people's car&quot; similar to the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[Citroën 2CV]] of Germany and France. The new Soviet car, called the [[Lada]], was a more spacious offering, in [[Sedan (car)|four-door saloon]] and [[Station wagon|five-door estate]] variants. Fiat installed British machine tools supplied by Herbert-BSA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bsamachinetools.com/main.htm |title=Main |publisher=Bsamachinetools.com |access-date=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Birmingham]] for the manufacture of many Lada parts. The 124's design was mechanically upgraded to survive treacherous Russian driving conditions and extremely cold winters. Imports to Western Europe, Canada, and some third world countries sold well owing to their low price. This car was upgraded to become the [[Lada Riva]] (marketing name in some markets) in 1980. Lada has gone on to develop some of its own models. The [[Off-road vehicle|four-wheel drive]] [[Lada Niva]] uses some Fiat based components, e.g. engine and gearbox, but the body and four-wheel drive system are VAZ designs.

===Bulgaria===
1967–1971 produced [[Pirin-Fiat]] in [[Lovech]], Bulgaria.

===Tofaş (Turkey)===
[[Tofaş]] is joint venture owned by Fiat SpA and [[Koç Holding]] (37.8% Fiat Group Automobiles, 37.8% Koc and 24.3% others).&lt;ref name=&quot;fiat.co.nz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiat.co.nz/default.aspx?MenuId=240|title=Fiat and PSA Citroën reveal new van family|access-date=18 April 2009|work=fiat.co.nz|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015100157/http://fiat.co.nz/default.aspx?MenuId=240|archive-date=15 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiat 124 was produced under licence by [[Tofaş]] as the [[Fiat 124#Turkish|Tofaş Murat]]. This was replaced by a version of the [[Fiat 131]], known as the [[Tofaş Şahin]]. Today the [[Fiat Linea]] car is amongst those manufactured by the Fiat-Tofas joint venture in Turkey, and the company has 12.1% of the Turkish car market as of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;koc.com.tr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koc.com.tr/en-US/Business/FordOtosan/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719072216/http://www.koc.com.tr/en-US/Business/FordOtosan/|archive-date=19 July 2008|title=Automotive Group|access-date=18 April 2009|work=koc.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEAT (Spain)===
In Spain, [[SEAT]]—Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo (Spanish Touring Car Company)—was established with Fiat assistance in 1950, producing Fiat models under its own brand name until 1981, when Fiat withdrew its support. In 1982 SEAT signed a cooperation agreement with the German manufacturer [[Volkswagen]] and by the end of 1986 after a purchase of a majority stake SEAT had become part of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. However, production of some Fiat-based models continued, ending with the Fiat-based [[SEAT Marbella|Marbella]] in 1998.

===Ethiopia===
The [[Fiat 131]], known as the [[Holland Car]] DOCC.

===Egypt===
Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] ordered the EGID (General Intelligence Agent) to establish a state owned automobile company. [[Nasr (car company)|Nasr]] was founded in 1960 in Helwan, Egypt. It began producing some Fiat based models, but later produced the [[Tofaş Şahin]] under license by Tofaş. The last Fiat 128 model was built in 2008, while the Şahin is still in production in Egypt.

Currently the ''El-Mashreq Company'', a part of the [[Seoudi Group]] is the main manufacturer of Alfa Romeo and Fiat vehicles for the Egyptian market. [[Arab American Vehicles]] (AAV) also manufactured Fiats in Egypt. They assembled the [[Fiat Ritmo]] at the behest of Nasr.

===India===
[[Fiat India Automobiles|Fiat India Automobiles Private Limited]] (FIAPL) is a joint venture between Fiat and [[Mumbai]] based [[Tata Motors]], founded in 1997. Fiat builds the [[Fiat Palio|Palio Stile]], Linea and [[Fiat Punto|Punto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techno season at FIAT Caffé|url=http://www.fiat-india.com/docs/pdf/Fiat_Caffe-_Italian_technological_press_note_Pune.pdf|work=Fiat India|access-date=21 February 2013|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiat plant is situated in Ranjangaon near Pune in Maharashtra and also manufactures the [[Tata Indica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fiat-india.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiat-india.com/Fiat_Aboutus/fiat_AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|access-date=3 July 2008|work=fiat-india.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080702173715/http://www.fiat-india.com/Fiat_Aboutus/fiat_AboutUs.aspx  |archive-date = 2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a subsidiary of Fiat, [[Premier Automobiles]] of Mumbai was licensed to manufacture versions of the [[Fiat 500]] for the Indian market. This was followed by the [[Fiat 1100]] in 1954. In 1973, the Fiat label was replaced with the Premier name.

===Pakistan===
Raja Motors are the authorized manufacturers of Fiat motor vehicles in Pakistan since 1948. The manufacturing started with VESPA scooters in 1948. The project was expanded in 2001 to facilitate assembly-cum-manufacturing of the [[Fiat Uno]]. The production facility is located in Landhi Industrial Area, [[Karachi]], Pakistan.

===Sri Lanka===
In 1973, entrepreneur [[Upali Wijewardena]]'s Upali Motor Company began assembly of the local variant of Fiat 128, known as UMC-Fiat 128.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Production ended with the introduction of the open-market economy in 1978.

===North Korea===
The North Korean car manufacturer and dealer [[Pyeonghwa Motors]] assembles two Fiat models under licence since 2002: Hwiparam&amp;nbsp;(whistle)—based on the [[Fiat Siena]], Bbeokgugi&amp;nbsp;(owl)—based on the [[Fiat Doblò]].

Year '''210''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCX]]''') was a [[common year starting on Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Faustinus and Rufinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 963 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 210 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

In September 1999, with the fighting over and an international force in place within Kosovo, the KLA was officially disbanded and thousands of its members entered the [[Kosovo Protection Corps]], a civilian emergency protection body that replaced the KLA and Kosovo Police Force, as foreseen in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The ending of the Kosovo war resulted in the emergence of offshoot guerilla groups and political organisations from the KLA continuing violent struggles in [[Insurgency in the Preševo Valley|southern Serbia]] (1999–2001) and [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|northwestern Macedonia]] (2001), which resulted in peace talks and greater Albanian rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koktsidis|first1=Pavlos Ioannis|last2=Dam|first2=Caspar Ten|title=A success story?

The KLA is regarded as one of the most successful insurgencies of the post-[[Cold War]] period and as a model insurgency, with its quick success coming mostly from an unusual configuration of geopolitical and popular phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLA received large funds from Albanian diaspora organizations. There have been allegations that it used [[narcoterrorism]] to finance its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Narco-terrorism: international drug trafficking and terrorism, a dangerous mix : hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, One Hundred Eighth Congress, first session|date=May 20, 2003|publisher=United States Senate U.S. G.P.O.|page=[https://books.google.rs/books?id=B0gTAAAAIAAJ 111]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perritt8893&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|pp=88–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Abuses and war crimes were committed by the KLA during and after the conflict, such as massacres of civilians, prison camps and destruction of cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref name=hrw1&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword.htm UNDER ORDERS: War Crimes in Kosovo. executive summary]. hrw.org (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] considered and approved the establishment of a [[Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution|special court]] to try cases involving crimes and other serious abuses allegedly committed in 1999–2000 by members of the KLA.&lt;ref name=announcementNL&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Government of the Netherlands]]|url=https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2016/01/15/kosovo-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague|title=Kosovo court to be established in The Hague|date=15 January 2016|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2020 the [[Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office]] filed indictments for [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s against a number of former KLA members, including the president of Kosovo [[Hashim Thaçi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_06-24-2020&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)}}
A key precursor to the Kosovo Liberation Army was the [[People's Movement of Kosovo]] (LPK). This group, who argued Kosovo's freedom could be won only through armed struggle, traces back to 1982, and played a crucial role in the creation of the KLA in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Judah|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_F0lqCkITqcC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6iBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423 423]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fund-raising began in the 1980s in Switzerland by Albanian exiles of the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|violence of 1981]] and subsequent émigrés.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA88 88], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA7 7]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slobodan Milošević]] revoked Kosovan autonomy in 1989, returning the region to its 1945 status, ejecting ethnic Albanians from the Kosovan bureaucracy and violently putting down protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kola|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nAANq88bBH8C&amp;pg=PA180 180–3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Vickers 2001 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vickers|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_F0lqCkITqcC&amp;pg=PA32 32]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Kosovar Albanians established the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] (LDK). Headed by [[Ibrahim Rugova]], its goal was independence from Serbia, but via peaceful means. To this end, the LDK set up and developed a &quot;parallel state&quot; with a particular focus on education and healthcare.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vickers 2001 32&quot; /&gt;

The KLA made their name known publicly for the first time in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a first public appearance followed in 1997, at which time its membership was still only around 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; Critical of the progress made by Rugova, the KLA received boosts from the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]]— these granted Kosovo nothing, and so generated a more widespread rejection of the LDK's peaceful methods — and from looted weaponry that spilled into Kosovo after the [[Albanian rebellion of 1997]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_F0lqCkITqcC&amp;pg=PA26 26]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1997–98, the Kosovo Liberation Army moved ahead of Rugova's LDK, a fact starkly illustrated by the KLA's [[Hashim Thaçi]] leading the Kosovar Albanians at the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet negotiations]] of spring 1999, with Rugova as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Judah|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_F0lqCkITqcC&amp;pg=PA24 24]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, the KLA undertook a series of attacks against police stations and Yugoslav government officers, saying that they had killed Albanian civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unknown Albanian 'liberation army' claims attacks&quot;, Agence France Presse, 17 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the British weekly ''[[The European (newspaper)|The European]]'' carried an article by a French expert stating that &quot;German civil and military intelligence services have been involved in training and equipping the rebels with the aim of cementing German influence in the [[Balkan]] area. (...) The birth of the KLA in 1996 coincided with the appointment of Hansjoerg Geiger as the new head of the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] (German secret Service). (...) The BND men were in charge of selecting recruits for the KLA command structure from the 500,000 Kosovars in Albania.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fallgot, Roger (1998): &quot;How Germany Backed KLA&quot;, in ''The European'', 21–27 September. pp.&amp;#8239;21–27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthias Küntzel]] tried to prove later on that German secret diplomacy had been instrumental in helping the KLA since its creation.&lt;ref&gt;Küntzel, Matthias (2002): ''Der Weg in den Krieg. Deutschland, die Nato und das Kosovo'' (The Road to War. Germany, Nato and Kosovo). Elefanten Press. Berlin, Germany. pp. 59–64 {{ISBN|3885207710}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian authorities denounced the KLA as a terrorist organisation and increased the number of security forces in the region. This had the effect of boosting the credibility of the embryonic KLA among the Kosovo Albanian population. Not long before NATO's military action commenced, the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] reported that &quot;Kosovo Liberation Army ... attacks aimed at trying to 'cleanse' Kosovo of its ethnic Serb population.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Hammond 2004 178&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hammond|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=skdoYDs1e8AC&amp;pg=PA178 178]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO North Atlantic Council had stressed that KLA was &quot;the main initiator of the violence&quot; and that it had &quot;launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hammond 2004 178&quot; /&gt;

One of the goals mentioned by the KLA commanders was the formation of [[Greater Albania]], [[irredentist]] concept of lands that are considered to form the national homeland by many Albanians, encompassing Kosovo, Albania, and the ethnic Albanian minority of neighbouring [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name=Janssens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Funding==

The KLA received large funds from the Albanian diaspora in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that those funds amounted from $75 million to $100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perritt8893&quot;/&gt; According to some sources the KLA received substantial funds from its involvement in the drug trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sörensen|first=Jens Stilhoff|year=2009|title=State Collapse and Reconstruction in the Periphery: Political Economy, Ethnicity and Development in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Kosovo|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-84545-560-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZXaFrO1AlEC|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jonsson|first=Michael|editor1-last=Cornell|editor1-first=Svante|editor2-last=Jonsson|editor2-first=Michael|year=2014|title=Conflict, Crime, and the State in Postcommunist Eurasia|chapter=The Kosovo Conflict: From Humanitarian Intervention to State Capture|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-81224-565-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYpwAgAAQBAJ|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; However insufficient evidence exists that the KLA itself was involved in such activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perritt93&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Perritt|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlHqkxGk4Q8C&amp;pg=PA93 93]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization in 1998, it noted its links to the heroin trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCollum|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-lFsChydhccC&amp;pg=PA43 43]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a briefing paper for the U.S. Congress stated: &quot;We would be remiss to dismiss allegations that between 30 and 50 percent of the KLA's money comes from drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebnikov|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mOcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 65]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, Western intelligence agencies estimated that over $250m of narcotics money had found its way into KLA coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dempsey|Fontaine|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0V2QAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the NATO bombing, KLA-linked heroin traffickers began using Kosovo again as a major supply route; in 2000, an estimated 80% of Europe's heroin supply was controlled by Kosovar Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebnikov|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mOcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 64]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

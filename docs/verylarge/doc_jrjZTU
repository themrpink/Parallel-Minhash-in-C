Although studying various subjects, Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and most significantly, [[Martin Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=34|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=46}} He began reading the publications of philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]], taking a particular interest in his work exploring the [[history of science]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=35|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=60–61}} He graduated from the ENS with a [[Licence (France)|B.A. (licence)]] in Philosophy in 1948&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift p. 126&quot;/&gt; and a DES (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]]) in Philosophy in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift p. 126&quot;/&gt; His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled ''La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Phénoménologie de l'esprit de Hegel'' (''The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's [[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift p. 126&quot;/&gt;

In 1948, the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] became a tutor at the ENS. A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste français'', PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] viewpoint, rejecting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32–36, 51–55|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23–26, 37–40|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the 1952–53 &quot;[[Doctors' plot]]&quot; in the [[Soviet Union]]. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=56–57|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=39–40|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=57–58}} Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy on the second try, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=36–38|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=43–45|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=61}} Excused from [[national service]] on medical grounds, he decided to start a [[doctorate]] at the [[Fondation Dosne-Thiers|Fondation Thiers]] in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=39–40|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=45–46, 49}} but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Derek. 2012. ''French Post-War Social Theory: International Knowledge Transfer.'' SAGE Publications. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault was also interested in psychology and he attended [[Daniel Lagache]]'s lectures at the University of Paris, where he obtained a [[Licence (France)|B.A. (licence)]] in Psychology in 1949 and a [[Specialist diploma|Diploma]] in [[Psychopathology]] (''Diplôme de psychopathologie'') from the University's Institute of Psychology (now {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut de psychologie de l'université Paris Descartes|fr}}) in June 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrift p. 126&quot;/&gt;

==Early career (1951–1955)==
[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|right|175px|In the early 1950s, Foucault came under the influence of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who remained a core influence on his work throughout his life.]]
Over the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|p=61}} From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser's invitation.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=50|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=49|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=62}} In Paris, he shared a flat with his brother, who was training to become a surgeon, but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of [[Lille]], teaching psychology at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|Université de Lille]] from 1953 to 1954.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=61–62|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=47}} Many of his students liked his lecturing style.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=56}} Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] every day to read the work of psychologists like [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Karl Jaspers]].{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=49|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=61–62}} Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] laboratory.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=41–49|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=56–58|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=62}} Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]], undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo [[Rorschach test]]s.{{Sfnm|Eribon|1991|1pp=30, 43|Miller|1993|2pp=62–63}}

Embracing the Parisian ''avant-garde'', Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the [[serialism|serialist]] composer [[Jean Barraqué]]. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] sexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=65–68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50–53|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=66, 79–82, 89–91}} In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqué holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' (1873–76), a set of four essays by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Later describing Nietzsche's work as &quot;a revelation&quot;, he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=52|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=64–67}} Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s new play, ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=41|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=64–65}}

Interested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s book reviews published in ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]''. Enamoured of Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of &quot;interviewing&quot; himself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=58|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=55|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=82–84}} Foucault also came across [[Hermann Broch]]'s 1945 novel ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'', a work that obsessed both him and Barraqué. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an [[epic opera]], Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=66|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=53|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=84–85}} The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Jean Genet]], all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=31|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=51–52}}

{{rquote|right|''I belong to that generation who, as students, had before their eyes, and were limited by, a horizon consisting of Marxism, phenomenology and existentialism. For me the break was first Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'', a breathtaking performance.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=65}}}}

Interested in the work of Swiss psychologist [[Ludwig Binswanger]], Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger's studies of [[Ellen West]] who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=44–45|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=59–61|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=73–75}} In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger's paper &quot;Dream and Existence&quot;, in which he argued that dreams constituted &quot;the birth of the world&quot; or &quot;the heart laid bare,&quot; expressing the mind's deepest desires.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=45–46|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=67–69|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=76–77}} That same year, Foucault published his first book, ''Maladie mentale et personalité'' (&quot;Mental Illness and Personality&quot;), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of [[Sociology|sociologists]] and anthropologists such as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Margaret Mead]], he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=68–70|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=63–66|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=63}} Biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]] noted that while the book exhibited &quot;erudition and evident intelligence,&quot; it lacked the &quot;kind of fire and flair&quot; which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=63}} It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=67}} Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=70}}

===Sweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955–1960===
Foucault spent the next five years abroad, first in [[Sweden]], working as cultural diplomat at the [[University of Uppsala]], a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion [[Georges Dumézil]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=73–74|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=70–71}} At [[Uppsala]] he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=76–78|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=73, 76}} Although finding it difficult to adjust to the &quot;Nordic gloom&quot; and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-François Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-Lépine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=74–77|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=74–75}} In spring 1956 Barraqué broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the &quot;vertigo of madness&quot;.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=81|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's ''[[Carolina Rediviva]]'' library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=78}} Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped that Uppsala University would accept it, but [[Sten Lindroth]], a [[positivism|positivistic]] historian of science there, remained unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=83–86|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=79–80}} Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190}}

Again at Dumézil's behest, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the capital of [[Polish People's Republic]], [[Warsaw]] and took charge of the [[University of Warsaw]]'s Centre Français.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=87|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=84|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the [[Polish October]] of 1956, when students had protested against the governing communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he felt that most Poles despised their government as a [[puppet regime]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and thought that the system ran &quot;badly&quot;.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=194|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=84–85}} Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of ''de facto'' cultural attaché.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=85–86}} Like France and Sweden, Poland legally tolerated but socially frowned on homosexual activity, and Foucault undertook relationships with a number of men; one was with a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which therefore would reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered{{by whom|date=August 2020}} to leave Poland for a new destination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=86–87}} Various positions were available in [[West Germany]], and so Foucault relocated to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut français Hamburg|de}} (where he served as director in 1958–60), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=89–90|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=87–88}}&lt;ref name=&quot;21st Century&quot;&gt;

== Growing career (1960–1970) ==

===''Madness and Civilization'': 1960===
{{rquote|right|Histoire de la folie ''is not an easy text to read, and it defies attempts to summarise its contents. Foucault refers to a bewildering variety of sources, ranging from well-known authors such as [[Erasmus]] and [[Molière]] to archival documents and forgotten figures in the history of medicine and psychiatry. His erudition derives from years pondering, to cite [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], '[[The Raven|over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore]]', and his learning is not always worn lightly.''|Foucault biographer [[David Macey]], 1993{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=96}}}}

In West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (''thèse principale'') for his [[State doctorate]], titled ''[[Madness and Civilization|Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique]]'' (trans. &quot;Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age&quot;), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the [[history of medicine]]. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with [[Insanity|madness]], arguing that it was a social construct distinct from [[mental illness]]. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}

''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90–92|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88–89}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a ''rapporteur'', or &quot;sponsor&quot; for the work: Foucault chose [[Georges Canguilhem]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=101–02|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=103–06}} The second was to find a publisher, and as a result ''Folie et déraison'' was published in French in May 1961 by the company [[Plon]], whom Foucault chose over [[Presses Universitaires de France]] after being rejected by [[Gallimard]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=105–07|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=106–09|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=117–18}} In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as ''Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason''.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=122|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=118}}

''Folie et déraison'' received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[Fernand Braudel]], it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=116|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=113–19|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=118}} It was notably criticised for advocating [[metaphysics]] by young philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in a March 1963 lecture at the [[University of Paris]]. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of [[René Descartes]]. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=119–21|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=142–45|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=118–19}} In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=122–26}}

Foucault's secondary thesis ({{Lang-fr|thèse complémentaire}}), written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960, was a translation and commentary on German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798);&lt;ref name=&quot;21st Century&quot;/&gt; the thesis was titled &quot;[[Introduction to Kant's Anthropology|Introduction à l{{'}}''Anthropologie'']].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm &quot;Introduction to Kant's Anthropology from a pragmatic point of view&quot; (English translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating—an &quot;archaeology of the Kantian text&quot;—he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=110|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=89}} This work's ''rapporteur'' was Foucault's old tutor and then-director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense of his [[doctoral thesis]] (''soutenance de thèse'') on 20 May 1961.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=111–13}} The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer [[Henri Gouhier]] noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly &quot;thinks in allegories&quot;.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=104–05}} They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate &quot;despite reservations.&quot;{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=115}}

===University of Clermont-Ferrand, ''The Birth of the Clinic'', and ''The Order of Things'': 1960–1966===
In October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], commuting to the city every week from Paris,{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=129|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=92}} Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a &quot;fascinating&quot; but &quot;rather traditional&quot; teacher at Clermont.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=140–41}} The department was run by [[Jules Vuillemin]], who soon developed a friendship with Foucault.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=131|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=109}} Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the [[Collège de France]] in 1962.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=137}} In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: [[Roger Garaudy]], a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=136–38|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=109–10}} Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher [[Daniel Defert]], with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=141–42|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=92–93, 110|3a1=Halperin|3y=1997|3p=214}}

[[File:Raymond roussel.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Foucault adored the work of Raymond Roussel and wrote a literary study of it.]]

Foucault maintained a keen interest in literature, publishing reviews in literary journals, including ''[[Tel Quel]]'' and ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'', and sitting on the editorial board of ''Critique''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=141, 151|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=120–21}} In May 1963, he published a book devoted to poet, novelist, and playwright [[Raymond Roussel]]. It was written in under two months, published by [[Gallimard]], and was described by biographer [[David Macey]] as &quot;a very personal book&quot; that resulted from a &quot;love affair&quot; with Roussel's work. It was published in English in 1983 as ''Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=145–48|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=124–29}} Receiving few reviews, it was largely ignored.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=140–42}} That same year he published a sequel to '' Folie et déraison'', titled ''Naissance de la Clinique'', subsequently translated as ''[[The Birth of the Clinic|The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception]]''. Shorter than its predecessor, it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=152–54|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=130–37}} Like his preceding work, ''Naissance de la Clinique'' was largely critically ignored, but later gained a cult following.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=140–42}} It was of interest within the field of [[medical ethics]], as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals, and the training that those working within them receive, bring about a particular way of looking at the body: the 'medical [[gaze]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth Of The Clinic|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Tavistock Publications Limited|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=35–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault was also selected to be among the &quot;Eighteen Man Commission&quot; that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by [[Christian Fouchet]], the Gaullist [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]]. Implemented in 1967, they brought staff strikes and student protests.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=133–36}}

In April 1966, Gallimard published Foucault's ''Les Mots et les choses'' (&quot;Words and Things&quot;), later translated as ''[[The Order of Things|The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences]]''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=155–56|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=159}} Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period's [[episteme]] to another.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=158–59}} Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=155, 159|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=160}} Appearing at the height of interest in [[structuralism]], Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Roland Barthes]], as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the [[existentialism]] popularized by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pages=1605–162, 167}} Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] attacked Foucault's ideas as &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot;, while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that &quot;Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else.&quot;{{Sfn|Macey|1993|pp=173–77}}

I was present for large, violent student riots that preceded by several weeks what happened in May in France. This was March 1968. The unrest lasted a whole year: strikes, courses suspended, arrests. And in March, a general strike by the students. The police came into the university, beat up the students, wounded several of them seriously, and started making arrests ... I have to say that I was tremendously impressed by those young men and women who took terrible risks by writing or distributing tracts or calling for strikes, the ones who really risked losing their freedom! It was a political experience for me.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=194}}}}

In September 1966, Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the [[University of Tunis]] in [[Tunisia]]. His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his [[national service]]. Foucault moved a few kilometres from [[Tunis]], to the village of [[Sidi Bou Saïd]], where fellow academic Gérard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival, Foucault announced that Tunisia was &quot;blessed by history&quot;, a nation which &quot;deserves to live forever because it was where [[Hannibal]] and [[St. Augustine]] lived.&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=187–88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=145–46}} His lectures at the university proved very popular, and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a &quot;representative of Gaullist technocracy&quot;, even though he considered himself a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=188–89}}

Foucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=192–93}} While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist [[René Magritte]], Foucault started to write a book about the [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist [[Édouard Manet]], but never completed it.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=173}}

In 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=198}} After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education [[Edgar Faure]] responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the [[Paris VIII|Centre Expérimental de Vincennes]] in [[Vincennes]] on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=201–02}} Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain &quot;the best in French philosophy today&quot; for his department, employing [[Michel Serres]], [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[François Regnault]], [[Henri Weber]], [[Étienne Balibar]], and [[François Châtelet]]; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=203–05}}

Lectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=205}} In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualité.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=206}} Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left,{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=201}} undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a [[Maoism|Maoist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=209}} Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, &quot;The end of Metaphysics&quot;, and &quot;The Discourse of Sexuality&quot;, which were highly popular and over-subscribed.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=207}} While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education [[Olivier Guichard]] was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department's degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=207–08}}

== Later life (1970–1984) ==

===Collège de France and ''Discipline and Punish'': 1970–1975===
Foucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious [[Collège de France]]. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the &quot;history of systems of thought,&quot; and his request was championed by members Dumézil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Collège, though with opposition by a large minority.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212–18}} He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as ''L'Ordre du discours'' (''The Discourse of Language'').{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=212, 219}} He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year—and did so for the rest of his life—covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became &quot;one of the events of Parisian intellectual life&quot; and were repeatedly packed out events.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=222–23}} On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a &quot;Foulcauldian tribe&quot; who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they published a number of short books.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=256–58}} Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}  In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the [[University at Buffalo]] in Buffalo, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James, ''The Passion of Michel Foucault'', Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] and journalist [[Jean-Marie Domenach]]. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=224–29}} The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=231–32}} The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=233–34}} Also campaigning against the [[death penalty]], Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the convicted murderer Pierre Rivière.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=234–35}} After his research into the penal system, Foucault published ''Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison'' (''[[Discipline and Punish]]'') in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|year=2015|title=The Theatre of Punishment: Case Studies in the Political Function of Corporal and Capital Punishment|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/14/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|volume=14|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Didier Eribon]] described it as &quot;perhaps the finest&quot; of Foucault's works, and it was well received.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=235–36}}

Foucault was also active in [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns; in November 1971, he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Djellali Ben Ali.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre, the journalist [[Claude Mauriac]], and one of his literary heroes, Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=238–42}} At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=241–42}} Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Libération (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper ''[[Libération]]'', and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the &quot;Chronicle of the Workers' Memory&quot; to allow workers to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper,  but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with ''Libération'', believing that it distorted the facts; he did not publish in it until 1980.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=250–54}} In 1975 he had a [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] experience with Simeon Wade in [[Death Valley]], California and later wrote “it was the greatest experience of his life, and that it profoundly changed his life and his work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2017/09/when-michel-foucault-tripped-on-acid-in-death-valley-and-called-it-the-greatest-experience-of-my-life-1975.html|title=When Michel Foucault Tripped on Acid in Death Valley and Called It &quot;The Greatest Experience of My Life&quot; (1975)|last1=15 September|first1=in Philosophy {{!}}|last2=Comments|first2=2017 6|website=Open Culture|language=en-US|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The History of Sexuality'' and Iranian Revolution: 1976–1979===
In 1976, Gallimard published Foucault's ''[[The History of Sexuality|Histoire de la sexualité: la volonté de savoir]]'' (''The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge''), a short book exploring what Foucault called the &quot;repressive hypothesis&quot;. It revolved largely around the concept of power, rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=269–74}} ''Histoire de la sexualité'' was a best-seller in France and gained positive press, but lukewarm intellectual interest, something that upset Foucault, who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=275–76}} He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member [[Pierre Nora]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=292}} Along with [[Paul Veyne]] and [[François Wahl]], Foucault launched a new series of academic books, known as ''Des travaux'' (''Some Works''), through the company [[Seuil]], which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=193–95}} He also produced introductions for the memoirs of [[Herculine Barbin]] and ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]''.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=277–78}}

Foucault's ''[[The History of Sexuality|Histoire de la Sexualité: la volonté de savoir]]'' concentrates on the relation between truth and sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=21 September 2016|title=Sex and Truth: Foucault's History of Sexuality as History of Truth|journal=Cultural History|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines truth as a system of ordered procedures for the production, distribution, regulation, circulation, and operation of statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Heroux|first1=Erick|last2=Foucault|first2=Michel|last3=Faubion|first3=James D.|last4=Hurley|first4=Robert|date=2001|title=Power.

Though Foucault's definition of truth may differ from other sociologists before and after him, his work with truth in relation to power structures, such as sexuality, have left a profound mark on social science theory. In his work, he examines the heightened curiosity regarding sexuality that induced a &quot;world of perversion&quot; during the elite, capitalist 18th and 19th century in the western world. According to Foucault in ''[[The History of Sexuality|History of Sexuality]]'', society of the modern age is symbolized by the conception of sexual discourses and their union with the system of truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;/&gt; In the &quot;world of perversion&quot;, including extramarital affairs, homosexual behavior, and other such sexual promiscuities, Foucault concludes that sexual relations of the kind are constructed around producing the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Max|date=28 June 2016|title=Mark G.E.

Thus, many aligned their personal virtues with those of the Church, further internalizing their beliefs on the meaning of sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; However, those who unify their sexual relation to the truth become decreasingly obliged to share their internal views with those of the Church. They will no longer see the arrangement of societal norms as an effect of the Church's deep-seated power structure.

After all, we are all ruled, and as such, we are in solidarity.''|Michel Foucault, 1981{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=79}}}}

Foucault remained a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to [[Madrid]] with six others to give a press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=263–66}} In 1977, he protested the extradition of [[Klaus Croissant]] to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=280}} In July that year, he organised an assembly of [[Eastern Bloc]] dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=278}} In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=278–79}}

In 1977, Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della sera]]'' asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], days after the [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]] massacre. Documenting the developing [[Iranian Revolution]], he met with opposition leaders such as [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] and [[Mehdi Bazargan]], and discovered the popular support for [[Islamism]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=281–85}} Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=285–88}} In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied [[Zen Buddhism]] under [[Omori Sogen]] at the Seionji temple in [[Uenohara]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}

===Final years: 1980–1984===
Although remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] government of [[François Mitterrand]] following its [[1981 French presidential election|electoral victory in 1981]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=296–97}} But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government's crackdown on the [[1982 demonstrations in Poland]] orchestrated by the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He and sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] authored a document condemning Mitterrand's inaction that was published in ''Libération'', and they also took part in large public protests on the issue.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=298–302}} Foucault continued to support Solidarity, and with his friend [[Simone Signoret]] traveled to Poland as part of a [[Médecins du Monde]] expedition, taking time out to visit the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=303–03}} He continued his academic research, and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of ''Histoire de la sexualité''. Volume two, ''L'Usage des plaisirs'', dealt with the &quot;techniques of self&quot; prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics, while volume three, ''Le Souci de soi'', explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume, ''Les Aveux de la chair'', was to examine sexuality in early Christianity, but it was not finished.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=317–23}}

In October 1980, Foucault became a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, giving the Howison Lectures on &quot;Truth and Subjectivity&quot;, while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at New York University. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, while Foucault went on to lecture at UCLA in 1981, the University of Vermont in 1982, and Berkeley again in 1983, where his lectures drew huge crowds.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=313–14}} Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene, frequenting [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] bathhouses, engaging in unprotected sex. He praised sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press, describing it as &quot;the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea about previously.&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=314–16|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=26–27}} Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=21–22}} Foucault initially referred to AIDS as a &quot;dreamed-up disease&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Q&amp;A With Edmund White |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/qa-edmund-white/ |date=2014 |publisher=The Nation |quote=I’d told him about it in 1981 when I was visiting, and he laughed at me and said, 'This is some new piece of American Puritanism. You’ve dreamed up a disease that punishes only gays and blacks?'{{thin space}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1983, he developed a persistent dry cough, which concerned friends in Paris, but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=324–25|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=26}} Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed; treated with antibiotics, he delivered a final set of lectures at the Collège de France.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=23}} Foucault entered Paris' Hôpital de la [[Salpêtrière]]—the same institution that he had studied in ''Madness and Civilisation''—on 10 June 1984, with neurological symptoms complicated by [[sepsis]]. He died in the hospital on 25 June.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=357|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=21, 24}}

== Death ==
On 26 June 1984, ''Libération'' announced Foucault's death, mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day, ''Le Monde'' issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family that made no reference to HIV/AIDS.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=327|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=21}} On 29 June, Foucault's ''la levée du corps'' ceremony was held, in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended, including activists and academic friends, while [[Gilles Deleuze]] gave a speech using excerpts from ''The History of Sexuality''.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=329|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=34–36}} His body was then buried at [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]] in a small ceremony.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=330}} Soon after his death, Foucault's partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the first national HIV/AIDS organisation in France, [[AIDES]]; a play on the French language word for &quot;help&quot; (''aide'') and the English language acronym for the disease.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=23–24}} On the second anniversary of Foucault's death, Defert publicly revealed that Foucault's death was AIDS-related in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.{{sfn|Miller|1993|pp=24–25}}

==Personal life==
Foucault's first biographer, [[Didier Eribon]], described the philosopher as &quot;a complex, many-sided character&quot;, and that &quot;under one mask there is always another&quot;.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=xi}} He also noted that he exhibited an &quot;enormous capacity for work&quot;.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=64}} At the ENS, Foucault's classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both &quot;disconcerting and strange&quot; and &quot;a passionate worker&quot;.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=30}} As he aged, his personality changed: Eribon noted that while he was a &quot;tortured adolescent&quot;, post-1960, he had become &quot;a radiant man, relaxed and cheerful&quot;, even being described by those who worked with him as a [[dandy]].{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=138}} He noted that in 1969, Foucault embodied the idea of &quot;the militant intellectual&quot;.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=210}}

===Politics===
Politically, Foucault was a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] throughout much of his life, though his particular stance within the left often changed. In the early 1950s, while never adopting an orthodox [[Marxism|Marxist]] viewpoint, Foucault had been a member of the [[French Communist Party]], leaving the party after three years as he expressed disgust in the prejudice  within its ranks against [[Jews]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]]. After spending some time working in Poland, governed at the time as a [[socialist state]] by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As result, in the early 1960s, Foucault was considered to be &quot;violently anticommunist&quot; by some of his detractors,{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|p=136}} even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/foucault/|title=Foucault, Michel {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=28 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
{{See also|Michel Foucault bibliography}}
Foucault's colleague [[Pierre Bourdieu]] summarized the philosopher's thought as &quot;a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power.&quot;{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=328}}

{{rquote|right|''The theme that underlies all Foucault's work is the relationship between power and knowledge, and how the former is used to control and define the latter. What authorities claim as 'scientific knowledge' are really just means of social control. Foucault shows how, for instance, in the eighteenth century 'madness' was used to categorize and stigmatize not just the mentally ill but the poor, the sick, the homeless and, indeed, anyone whose expressions of individuality were unwelcome.''|Philip Stokes, ''Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers'' (2004){{Sfn|Stokes|2004|p=187}}}}

Philosopher Philip Stokes of the [[University of Reading]] noted that overall, Foucault's work was &quot;dark and pessimistic.&quot; Though it does, however, leave some room for optimism, in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so, as Stokes claimed, the ways in which we are being dominated become better understood, so that we may strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination.{{Sfn|Stokes|2004|p=187}} In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualizes people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.D.

Later in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analyzing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterize the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to &quot;objectivise subjects.&quot; These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and 'order' knowledge about human populations; the second has been to categorize and 'normalise' human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on); and the third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one's own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foucault1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The Subject and Power|url=https://archive.org/details/michelfoucaultbe00drey_0|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226163123|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In addition to his philosophical work, Foucault also wrote on [[literature]]. ''Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel,'' published in 1963 and translated in English in 1986, is Foucault's only book-length work on literature. He described it as &quot;by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | title = Death and the labyrinth : the world of Raymond Roussel | url = https://archive.org/details/deathlabyrinthco00fouc | url-access = limited | publisher = Continuum | location = London New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8264-9362-0 |chapter=An Interview with Michel Foucault by Charles Ruas |page=[https://archive.org/details/deathlabyrinthco00fouc/page/n212 186] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of [[Raymond Roussel]], one of the first notable experimental writers. Foucault also gave a lecture responding to Roland Barthes' famous essay &quot;[[The Death of the Author]]&quot; titled &quot;[[What Is an Author?]]&quot; in 1969, later published in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Foucault reader|last=Foucault, Michel, 1926-1984.|date=1984|publisher=Pantheon Books|others=Rabinow, Paul.|isbn=0394529049|edition= 1st|location=New York|pages=|chapter=What Is An Author?|oclc=10021125}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary theoretician Kornelije Kvas, for Foucault, &quot;denying the existence of a historical author on account of his/ her irrelevance for interpretation is absurd, for the author is a function of the text that organizes its sense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Boundaries of Realism in World Literature|last=Kvas|first=Kornelije|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2020|isbn=978-1-7936-0910-6|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, London|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of power ===
Foucault's analysis of power comes in two forms: [[Empiricism|empirical]] and [[Theory|theoretical]]. The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: ''sovereign'' power, ''disciplinary'' power, and ''[[biopower]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch2011&quot;&gt;Lynch, R. A. (2011) Foucault's theory of power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 13-26). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault is generally critical to &quot;theories&quot; that try to give absolute answers to &quot;everything.&quot; Therefore, he considered his own &quot;theory&quot; of power to be closer to a method than a typical &quot;theory.&quot; According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch2011&quot; /&gt;

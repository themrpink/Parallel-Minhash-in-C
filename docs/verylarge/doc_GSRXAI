'''Pope Clement I''' ({{lang-la|Clemens Romanus}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Κλήμης Ῥώμης}}; died 99), also known as '''Saint Clement of Rome''', is listed by [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] as [[Bishop of Rome]], holding office from 88 to his death in 99.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; He is considered to be the first [[Apostolic Father]] of the Church, one of the three chief ones together with [[Polycarp]] and [[Ignatius of Antioch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt;

Few details are known about Clement's life. Clement was said to have been consecrated by [[Saint Peter|Peter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt; and he is known to have been a leading member of the church in Rome in the late [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]]. Early church lists place him as the second or third&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;{{efn|{{harvnb|Campbell|1907}} details the debate regarding whether there was one Pope with two names, or two distinct Popes. Ancient sources are contradictory, and modern scholarship is divided.}} bishop of Rome after Peter. The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' states that Clement died in [[Greece]] in the third year of Emperor [[Trajan]]'s reign, or 101 AD.

Clement's only genuine extant writing is his letter to the church at [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]] ([[1 Clement]]) in response to a dispute in which certain [[presbyter]]s of the Corinthian church had been deposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Frank Leslie |authorlink1=Frank Leslie Cross|last2=Livingstone|first2=Elizabeth A. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA363|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280290-3|page=363|chapter=Clement of Rome, St}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted the authority of the presbyters as rulers of the church on the ground that the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] had appointed such.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; His letter, which is one of the oldest extant Christian documents outside the [[New Testament]], was read in church, along with other epistles, some of which later [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|became part of the Christian canon]]. These works were the first to affirm the apostolic authority of the clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; A second epistle, [[2 Clement]], was attributed to Clement, although recent scholarship suggests it to be a [[homily]] by another author.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; In the legendary [[Clementine Literature]], Clement is the intermediary through whom the apostles teach the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;

According to tradition, Clement was imprisoned under the [[Emperor Trajan]]; during this time he is recorded to have led a ministry among fellow prisoners. Thereafter he was executed by being tied to an anchor and thrown into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt; Clement is recognized as a saint in many Christian churches and is considered a patron saint of mariners. He is commemorated on 23 November in the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Church]] In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] his feast is kept on 24 or 25 November.

A tradition that began in the 3rd and 4th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt; has identified him as the Clement that Paul mentioned in [[Philippians]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Philippians|4:3|KJV}}, a fellow laborer in Christ.{{efn|{{harvnb|Kelly|Walsh|2005|p=7}} note that &quot;Writers of the 3rd and 4th centuries, like [[Origen]], [[Eusebius]], and [[Jerome]], equate him (St. Clement I), perhaps, correctly, with the Clement whom St. Paul mentions ({{bibleref2|Phil|4:3}}) as a fellow worker.&quot;}}  While in the mid-19th century it was customary to identify him as a freedman of [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]], who was [[consul]] with his cousin, the Emperor [[Domitian]], this identification, which no ancient sources suggest, afterwards lost support.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;&gt;{{cite CE1913|last=Chapman|first= Henry Palmer|wstitle=Pope St. Clement I|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'' mentions a Clement whose office it was to communicate with other churches; most likely, this is a reference to Clement I.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vision II,&quot; 4. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

A large congregation existed in Rome c. 58, when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; Paul arrived in Rome c. 60 (Acts).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; His Captivity Epistles, as well as Mark, Luke, Acts, and 1 Peter were written here, according to many scholars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}Paul and Peter were said to have been martyred there.

Clement is known for his epistle to the church in Corinth (c. 96), in which he asserts the apostolic authority of the bishops/presbyters as rulers of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The epistle mentions ''episkopoi'' (overseers, bishops) or ''presbyteroi'' (elders, presbyters) as the upper class of minister, served by the deacons, but, since it does not mention himself, it gives no indication of the title or titles used for Clement in Rome.

[[File:Saintclementmartyr.png|left|thumb|upright|Martyrdom of St Clement by [[Fungai]]]]

== Death and legends of final days ==
According to apocryphal [[Acts of the Martyrs|''acta'']] dating to the 4th century at earliest, Clement was banished from Rome to the [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesus]] during the reign of the Emperor [[Trajan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot; /&gt; and was set to work in a stone quarry. Finding on his arrival that the prisoners were suffering from lack of water, he knelt down in prayer. Looking up, he saw a lamb on a hill, went to where the lamb had stood and struck the ground with his pickaxe, releasing a gushing stream of clear water. This miracle resulted in the conversion of large numbers of the local pagans and his fellow prisoners to Christianity. As punishment, Clement was [[martyr]]ed by being tied to an anchor&lt;ref name=&quot;Stracke&quot; /&gt; and thrown from a boat into the [[Black Sea]]. The legend recounts that every year a miraculous ebbing of the sea revealed a divinely built shrine containing his bones. However, the oldest sources on Clement's life, [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]], note nothing of his martyrdom.&lt;ref name=Schaff /&gt;{{rp|639}}

The [[Inkerman Cave Monastery]] marks the supposed place of Clement's burial in the Crimea. A year or two before his own death in 869, [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril]] brought to Rome what he believed to be the [[relics]] of Saint Clement, bones he found in the [[Crimea]] buried with an anchor on dry land. They are now enshrined in the [[Basilica di San Clemente]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt; Other relics of Saint Clement, including his head, are claimed by the [[Kyiv Monastery of the Caves]] in [[Ukraine]].

==Writings==
The ''Liber Pontificalis'' states that Clement wrote two letters (though the second letter, 2 Clement, is no longer{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} ascribed to him by many modern scholars).

===Epistle of Clement===
{{main|First Epistle of Clement}}
Clement's only extant, uncontested text is a letter to the [[Early Church|Christian congregation]] in [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], often called the [[First Epistle of Clement]] or 1 Clement. The history of 1 Clement clearly and continuously shows Clement as the author of this letter. It is considered the earliest authentic Christian document outside the [[New Testament]].

Clement writes to the troubled congregation in Corinth, where certain &quot;presbyters&quot; or &quot;bishops&quot; have been deposed (the class of clergy above that of deacons is designated indifferently by the two terms).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; Clement calls for repentance and reinstatement of those who have been deposed, in line with maintenance of order and obedience to church authority, since the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] established the ministry of &quot;bishops and deacons.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; He mentions &quot;offering the gifts&quot; as one of the functions of the higher class of clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; The epistle offers valuable insight into Church ministry at that time and into the history of the Roman Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; It was highly regarded, and was read in church at Corinth along with the Scriptures c. 170.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|We should be obedient unto God, rather than follow those who in arrogance and unruliness have set themselves up as leaders in abominable jealousy.... For Christ is with them that are lowly of mind, not with them that exalt themselves over the flock.|source={{harvnb|Clement of Rome|1885b|loc= 1 Clem 14:1; 16:1}}}}

In the epistle, Clement uses the terms &quot;bishop&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot; interchangeably for the higher order of ministers above deacons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot; /&gt; In some congregations, particularly in Egypt, the distinction between bishops and presbyters seems to have become established only later.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrossLivingstone2005p210&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Frank Leslie |authorlink1=Frank Leslie Cross|last2=Livingstone|first2=Elizabeth A. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280290-3|page=210|chapter=bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by the middle of the second century all the leading Christian centres had bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrossLivingstone2005p210&quot; /&gt; Scholars such as Bart Ehrman treat as significant the fact that, of the seven letters written by [[Ignatius of Antioch]] to seven Christian churches shortly after the time of Clement, the only one that does not present the church as headed by a single bishop is that addressed to the church in Rome, although this letter did not refer to a collective priesthood either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrman2008p83&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D |authorlink=Bart D Ehrman|title=Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend|url=https://archive.org/details/peterpaulmarymag00ehrm_0/page/83|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534350-2|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epistle has been cited as the first work to establish [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|Roman primacy]], but most scholars see the epistle as more fraternal than authoritative,{{efn|{{harvnb|Phan|2000|p=32}} writes, &quot;Most scholars would now regard 1 Clement as an impressive example of fraternal correction rather than an authoritative intervention.&quot; }} and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] scholar [[John Meyendorff]] sees it as connected with the Roman church's awareness of its &quot;priority&quot; (rather than &quot;primacy&quot;) among local churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyendorff1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John Meyendorff|title=The Primacy of Peter: Essays in Ecclesiology and the Early Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMjoJx8FD2wC|series=135-136|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|isbn=978-0-88141-125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writings formerly attributed to Clement ===
[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 094.jpg|thumb|''Saint Clement'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]]]

====Second Epistle of Clement====
{{main|Second Epistle of Clement}}
The Second Epistle of Clement is a homily, or sermon, likely written in Corinth or Rome, but not by Clement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; Early Christian congregations often shared homilies to be read. The homily describes Christian character and repentance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; It is possible that the Church from which Clement sent his epistle had included a festal homily to share in one economical post, thus the homily became known as the Second Epistle of Clement.

While 2 Clement has been traditionally ascribed to Clement, most scholars believe that 2 Clement was written in the 2nd century based on the doctrinal themes of the text and a near match between words in 2 Clement and in the [[Greek Gospel of the Egyptians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=McBrien&gt;{{cite book|last=McBrien|year=2000|title=Lives of the Popes|pages=35|publisher=HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epistles on Virginity====
Two &quot;Epistles on Virginity&quot; were traditionally attributed to Clement, but now there exists almost universal consensus that Clement was not the author of those two epistles.&lt;ref name=Virginity&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/antenicenefather08robeuoft/page/52/mode/2up|title=The Ante-Nicene Fathers : translations of the writings of the Fathers down to A.D. 325|volume= Volume VIII|chapter=Ch. XXX Two Epistles Concerning Virginity: Introductory Notice.|publisher=C.L. Pub. Co.|location=Buffalo |date=1885|author=Clement of Rome|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====False Decretals====
{{main|Pseudo-Isidore}}
A 9th-century collection of church legislation known as the False Decretals, which was once attributed to [[Isidore of Seville]], is largely composed of forgeries. All of what it presents as letters of pre-[[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] popes, beginning with Clement, are forgeries, as are some of the documents that it attributes to councils;{{efn|The Encyclopædia Britannica places the [[Donation of Constantine]] in this section; the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church places it in the section of the pre-Nicene Popes.}} and more than forty falsifications are found in the decretals that it gives as those of post-Nicene popes from [[Pope Sylvester I]] (314–335) to [[Pope Gregory II]] (715–731). The False Decretals were part of a series of falsifications of past legislation by a party in the Carolingian Empire whose principal aim was to free the church and the bishops from interference by the state and the [[Metropolitan archbishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan archbishops]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200996/False-Decretals Encyclopædia Britannica: ''False Decretals'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bunson|2004|p=345}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CrossLivingstone2005p601&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Frank Leslie |authorlink1=Frank Leslie Cross|last2=Livingstone|first2=Elizabeth A. |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA601|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280290-3|page=601|chapter=False Decretals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement is included among other early Christian popes as authors of the Pseudo-Isidoran (or False) Decretals, a 9th-century forgery. These decrees and letters portray even the early popes as claiming absolute and universal authority.{{efn|{{harvnb|Durant|2011|p=525}} writes, &quot;These early documents were designed to show that by the oldest traditions and practice of the Church no bishop might be deposed, no Church councils might be convened, and no major issue might be decided, without the consent of the pope. Even the early pontiffs, by these evidences, had claimed absolute and universal authority as vicars of Christ on Earth.&quot;}} Clement is the earliest pope to whom a text is attributed.

===Clementine literature===
{{main|Clementine literature}}
St. Clement is also the hero of an early Christian romance or [[novel]] that has survived in at least two different versions, known as the Clementine literature, where he is identified with Emperor [[Domitian]]'s cousin [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]]. Clementine literature portrays Clement as the Apostles' means of disseminating their teachings to the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;

==Recognition as a saint==
[[File:StClement Church Moscow 01-2016 img2.jpg|thumb|St. Clement is one of the few Roman Popes to have [[St. Clement's Church in Moscow|a Russian Orthodox church]] dedicated in his name.]]
St. Clement's name is in the [[Roman Canon]] of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He is commemorated on 23 November as a [[Pope]] and [[martyr]] in the [[Catholic Church]] as well as within the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Lutheran Church]]. The [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], as well as the [[Syriac Catholic Church]], the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and all [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] commemorate Saint Clement of Rome (called in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''&quot;Mor Clemis&quot;'') on 24 November; the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] commemorates St Clement on 25 November.

The [[St Clement's Church, Moscow|St Clement's Church]] in Moscow is renowned for its glittering Baroque interior and iconostasis, as well as a set of gilded 18th-century railings. The parish was disbanded in 1934 and the original free-standing gate was demolished. The Lenin State Library stored its books in the building throughout the Soviet period. It was not until 2008 that the building reverted to the Russian Orthodox Church.

Saint Clement of Rome is commemorated in the Synaxarium of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] on the 29th of the month of Hatour [25 November (Julian) – equivalent to 8 December (Gregorian) due to the current 13-day Julian–Gregorian Calendar offset]. According to the Coptic Church Synaxarium, he suffered martyrdom in AD 100 during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98–117). He was martyred by tying his neck to an anchor and casting him into the sea. The record of the 29th of the Coptic month of Hatour states that this saint was born in Rome to an honorable father whose name was Fostinus and also states that he was a member of the Roman senate and that his father educated him and taught him Greek literature.

===Symbolism===
[[File:Mariner's Cross.svg|thumb|[[Anchored Cross]], also known as Mariner's or Saint Clement's cross.]]
In works of art, Saint Clement can be recognized by having an anchor at his side or tied to his neck. He is most often depicted wearing [[papal vestments]], including the pallium, and sometimes with a [[papal tiara]] but more often with a [[mitre]]. He is also sometimes shown with symbols of his office as [[Pope]] or [[Bishop of Rome]] such as the [[papal cross]] and the [[Keys of Heaven]]. In reference to his martyrdom, he often holds the [[palm of martyrdom]].

Saint Clement can be seen depicted near a [[fountain]] or [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], relating to the incident from his [[hagiography]], or lying in a temple in the sea. The [[Anchored Cross]] or Mariner's Cross is also referred to as St. Clement's Cross, in reference to the way he was martyred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stracke&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stracke |first1=Richard |title=Saint Clement: The Iconography |url=http://www.christianiconography.info/clement.html |website=Christian Iconography | date=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider''''' is a 2001 [[Action film|action]] [[adventure film]] based on the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' video game series featuring the character [[Lara Croft]], portrayed by [[Angelina Jolie]]. An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany, it was directed by [[Simon West]] and revolves around Lara Croft trying to obtain ancient artifacts from the Illuminati.

The film was released on June 15, 2001, and received generally negative reviews from critics for its stylized action and bland plot, although Angelina Jolie was praised for her performance. ''Tomb Raider'' was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. A sequel, titled ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life]]'', was released in 2003.

==Plot==
Adventurer [[Lara Croft]] ([[Angelina Jolie]]) defeats a robot in an Egyptian tomb, revealed to be a training exercise arena in her family manor, where she lives with her technical assistant Bryce ([[Noah Taylor]]) and butler Hilary ([[Chris Barrie]]). In [[Venice]], as the first phase of a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|planetary alignment]] begins, the [[Illuminati]] search for a key to rejoin halves of a mysterious artifact, &quot;the Triangle,&quot; which must be completed by the final phase, a [[solar eclipse]]. Manfred Powell ([[Iain Glen]]) assures the cabal that the artifact is almost ready, but has no real idea of its location.

Lara's father Lord Richard Croft ([[Jon Voight]]), long missing and presumed dead, appears to her in a dream. Lara awakens to a mysterious ticking, and finds a strange clock hidden inside the manor. On her way to consult a friend of her father's, Wilson ([[Leslie Phillips]]), Lara crosses paths with Alex West ([[Daniel Craig]]), an American associate and fellow adventurer. Lara shows Wilson the clock, and he puts her in touch with Powell. Lara shows Powell photographs of the clock, which he claims not to recognize.

That night, armed commandos invade the house and steal the clock, bringing it to Powell. The next morning, a prearranged letter from Lara's father arrives, explaining that the clock is the key to retrieving the halves of the Triangle of Light, an ancient object with the power to control time. After misuse of its power destroyed an entire city, the Triangle was separated: one half was hidden in a [[Cambodia]]n tomb, the other in the ruined city, now modern-day [[Siberia]]. Her father tasks her to find and destroy both pieces before the Illuminati can exploit the Triangle's power.

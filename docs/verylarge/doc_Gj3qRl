In many tense, dramatic scenes, only the sounds of nature are used. An example of this is when commandos Warden and Joyce hunt a fleeing Japanese soldier through the jungle, desperate to prevent him from alerting other troops. Arnold won an Academy Award for the film's score.

Many historical inaccuracies in the film have often been noted by eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway and historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coast&quot;/&gt;

The plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional.&lt;ref name=fictionalplotkwai&gt;[http://hellfire-pass.commemoration.gov.au/remembering-the-railway/bridge-on-the-river-kwai.php &quot;Remembering the railway: ''The Bridge on the River Kwai''], ''www.hellfire-pass.commemoration.gov.au''.

The [[Burma Railway#Conditions during construction|conditions]] to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected were far worse than the film depicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;cwgc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/links.html|title=links for research, Allied POWs under the Japanese|work=mansell.com|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notorious Burma-Siam railway, built by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Dutch and American prisoners of war, was a Japanese project driven by the need for improved communications to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died in the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma. Two labour forces, one based in Siam and the other in Burma, worked from opposite ends of the line towards the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2017100|title=CWGC - Cemetery Details|author=Reading Room Manchester|work=cwgc.org|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel [[Philip Toosey]] of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. Toosey in fact did as much as possible to delay the building of the bridge. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: [[termites]] were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Davies |first= Peter N. |title= The Man Behind the Bridge |publisher= [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |year= 1991 |isbn = 0-485-11402-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of Toosey.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Summer |first= Julie |title= The Colonel of Tamarkan |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster Ltd]] |year= 2005 |isbn = 0-7432-6350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a BBC ''[[Timewatch]]'' programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his [[collaboration]] he would have been &quot;quietly eliminated&quot; by the other prisoners. Julie Summers, in her book ''The Colonel of Tamarkan'', writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot; /&gt; He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, Kevin (1996). ''David Lean: A Biography''. New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-14578-0}}. pp. 391 and 766n&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Gordon]], a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in a 1962 book, ''[[Through the Valley of the Kwai]]'': &quot;In Pierre Boulle's book ''The Bridge over the River Kwai'' and the film which was based on it, the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly, but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency. This was an entertaining story. But I am writing a factual account, and in justice to these men—living and dead—who worked on that bridge, I must make it clear that we never did so willingly. We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash, taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Ernest|title=Through the Valley of the Kwai|url=https://archive.org/details/throughvalleyofk00gord|url-access=registration|date=1962|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1579100360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1969 BBC television documentary, ''Return to the River Kwai'', made by former POW John Coast,&lt;ref name=&quot;coast&quot;&gt;A transcript of the interview and the documentary as a whole can be found in the new edition of John Coast's book ''Railroad of Death''.{{cite book|last=Coast|first=John|title=Railroad of Death|year=2014|publisher=Myrmidon|isbn=978-1-905802-93-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs. The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as &quot;Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Boxing Day [TV Listing] | pages = 14 | newspaper = The Guardian | location = London | date = 24 December 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends.

The major railway bridge described in the novel and film didn't actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the [[Mae Klong]] river – renamed [[Khwae Yai River|Khwae Yai]] in the 1960s as a result of the film – at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from [[Kanchanaburi]], Thailand.&lt;ref name=JSummersInterview&gt;[http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/colonel-tamarkan-philip-toosey-bridge-on-river-kwai &quot;The Colonel of Tamarkan: Philip Toosey and the ''Bridge on the River Kwai''&quot;], published by the [[National Army Museum]] on 03-04-2012. Retrieved 09-24-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today.&lt;ref name=JSummersInterview/&gt;

===Critical response ===
The film initially received generally positive reviews, with Guinness being widely praised for his performance. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 95% based on 58 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 9.33/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;This complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bridge_on_the_river_kwai/ |title=The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |accessdate=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai |title=The Bridge on the River Kwai Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert gives the film four out of four stars.&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=18 April 1999 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai-1957 |title=The Bridge on the River Kwai |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert notes that the film is one of the few war movies that &quot;focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals&quot;, but commented that the viewer is not certain what is intended by the final dialogue due to the film's shifting points of view.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;

Slant Magazine gave the film four out of five stars.&lt;ref name=blauvelt&gt;{{cite news |last=Blauvelt |first=Christian |date=20 September 2010 |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai |title=The Bridge on the River Kwai |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=[[Slant Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slant stated that &quot;the 1957 epic subtly develops its themes about the irrationality of honor and the hypocrisy of Britain's class system without ever compromising its thrilling war narrative&quot;, and in comparing to other films of the time said that Bridge on the River Kwai &quot;carefully builds its psychological tension until it erupts in a blinding flash of sulfur and flame.&quot;&lt;ref name=blauvelt /&gt;

Variety gave high praise for the movie saying that it is &quot;a gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.&quot;&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaplan |first=Mike |date=19 November 1967 |url=https://variety.com/1957/film/reviews/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai-2-1200418413/ |title=The Bridge on the River Kwai |accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant praise was also given to the actors especially Alec Guinness, Variety said that &quot;the film is unquestionably Guinness'&quot;.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt; William Holden was also credited for his acting, he was said to give a solid characterization and was &quot;easy, credible and always likeable in a role that is the pivot point of the story&quot;.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;

Warren Buffett said it was his favorite movie. In an interview he said that &quot;There were a lot of lessons in that&quot;, Buffett said of the film. &quot;The ending of that was sort of the story of life. He created the railroad. Did he really want the enemy to come in across it?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-wallet-american-express-card-400-cash-131943350.html|title=Warren Buffett carries an American Express card and about $400 in cash|website=finance.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Japanese viewers disliked the film's depiction of the Japanese characters present in the movie and the historical background presented as being inaccurate, particularly in the interactions between Saito and Nicholson. In particular, they objected to the implication presented in the film that Japanese military engineers were generally unskilled and unproficient at their professions. In reality, Japanese engineers proved to be just as capable at construction efforts as their Allied counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa Sukchiro, ''[http://www.fepow-community.org.uk/monthly_Revue/html/bridge_on_the_river_kwai.htm  Bridge on the River Kwai]'', accessed 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Julie (2012), ''[http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/colonel-tamarkan-philip-toosey-bridge-on-river-kwai  The Colonel of Tamarkan: Philip Toosey and the Bridge on the River Kwai]'', p. 6, accessed 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

The British Film Institute placed ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' as the 11th greatest British film.

==First TV broadcast==
[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], sponsored by [[Ford]], paid a record $1.8 million for the television rights for two screenings in the United States.&lt;ref name=tv&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=28 July 1967|page=1|title='Bounty' Nicks Ford $2.3 Mil; A TV Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 167-minute film was first telecast, uncut, in colour, on the evening of 25 September 1966, as a three hours-plus '''ABC Movie Special'''. The telecast of the film lasted more than three hours because of the commercial breaks. It was still highly unusual at that time for a television network to show such a long film in one evening; most films of that length were still generally split into two parts and shown over two evenings. But the unusual move paid off for ABC—the telecast drew huge ratings with a record audience of 72 million&lt;ref name=tv/&gt; and a [[Nielsen rating]] of 38.3 and an audience share of 61%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=24 January 1990|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot;&gt;Gowran, Clay (11 October 1966) [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1966/10/11/page/48/article/nielsen-ratings-are-dim-on-new-shows Nielsen Ratings Are Dim on New Shows], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (noting film received a 38.3 rating to lead the national Nielsen ratings)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restorations==
The film was restored in 1992 by Columbia Pictures. The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded &quot;atmospheric&quot; sound effects.&lt;ref name=DavidLean.com&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bridge on the River Kwai|url=http://www.davidlean.com/Filmography/Credits/kwai_credits.html|publisher=DavidLean.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129133902/http://davidlean.com/Filmography/Credits/kwai_credits.html|archivedate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bridge on the River Kwai Credits|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/27691?view=credit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926142700/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/27691?view=credit|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-09-26|publisher=BFI Film and TV Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bridgeontheriverkwaibd.com/ |title=Movies &amp;#124; Disc &amp; Digital &amp;#124; Sony Pictures |publisher=Bridgeontheriverkwaibd.com |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4k (roughly four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4k. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/columbiaclassics/in-production/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828092559/http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/columbiaclassics/in-production/|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In 1962, [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Peter Sellers]], with [[Peter Cook]] and [[Jonathan Miller]], released the [[LP album|LP record]] ''[[Bridge on the River Wye]]'' (Parlophone LP PMC&lt;!-- not a PMCID--&gt; 1190, PCS 3036 (November 1962)).  This spoof of the film was based on the script for the 1957 ''[[Goon Show]]'' episode &quot;An African Incident&quot;. Shortly before its release, for legal reasons, producer [[George Martin]] edited out the 'K' every time the word 'Kwai' was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thegoonshow.net/facts.asp |title= Facts and Trivia | work = The Goon Show Site | accessdate= 2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The comedy team of [[Wayne and Shuster]] performed a sketch titled &quot;Kwai Me a River&quot; on their 27 March 1967 TV show, in which an officer in the British Dental Corps (Wayne) is captured by the Japanese and, despite being comically unintimidated by any abuse the commander of the POW camp (Shuster) inflicts on him, is forced to build a (dental) &quot;bridge on the river Kwai&quot; for the commander and plans to include an explosive in the appliance to detonate in his mouth. The commander survives the explosion, attributed to a toothpaste commercial punchline in 1960s commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18984/wayne_and_shuster_show,_the/episode_guide/ |title=Wayne and Shuster Show, The Episode Guide (1954–1990) (series) |publisher= TV archive CA |accessdate= 2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sudetendeutsche.png|thumb|The native German-speaking regions in 1930, within the borders of the current [[Czech Republic]], which in the [[interwar period]] were referred to  as the Sudetenland]]

The '''Sudetenland''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Sudetenland.ogg|s|uː|ˈ|d|eɪ|t|ən|l|æ|n|d}}; {{IPA-de|zuˈdeːtn̩ˌlant|lang}}; [[Czech language|Czech]] and {{lang-sk|Sudety}}; {{lang-pl|Kraj Sudetów}}) is the historical [[German language|German]] name for the northern, southern, and western areas of former [[Czechoslovakia]] which were inhabited primarily by [[Sudeten Germans]]. These [[German language|German speakers]] had predominated in the border districts of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia]] from the time of the [[Austrian Empire]].

The word &quot;Sudetenland&quot; did not come into being until the early part of the 20th century and did not come to prominence until almost two decades into the century, after the [[First World War]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dismembered and the Sudeten Germans [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|found themselves living in]] the new country of Czechoslovakia. The ''Sudeten crisis'' of 1938 was provoked by the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanist]] demands of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] that the Sudetenland be annexed to Germany, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|which happened]] after the later [[Munich Agreement]]. Part of the borderland was invaded and [[Zaolzie#Part of Poland (1938–1939)|annexed by Poland]]. Afterwards, the formerly unrecognized Sudetenland became an [[Reichsgau Sudetenland|administrative division]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. When Czechoslovakia was reconstituted after the [[Second World War]], the Sudeten Germans were expelled and the region today is inhabited almost exclusively by [[Czech language|Czech]] speakers.

The word ''Sudetenland'' is a German compound of ''Land'', meaning &quot;country&quot;, and ''Sudeten'', the name of the [[Sudetes|Sudeten Mountains]], which run along the northern Czech border and [[Lower Silesia]] (now in [[Poland]]). The Sudetenland encompassed areas well beyond those mountains, however.

Parts of the now Czech regions of [[Karlovy Vary (region)|Karlovy Vary]], [[Liberec (region)|Liberec]], [[Olomouc Region|Olomouc]], [[Moravia-Silesia]], and [[Ústí nad Labem (region)|Ústí nad Labem]] are within the area called Sudetenland.

==History==
The areas later known as the Sudetenland never formed a single [[historical regions of Central Europe|historical region]], which makes it difficult to distinguish the history of the Sudetenland apart from that of Bohemia, until the advent of [[nationalism]] in the 19th century.

===Early origins===
{{See also|History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe}}
The [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Boii]] tribes settled there and the region was first mentioned on the map of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemaios]] in the 2nd century AD. The [[Germanic tribes|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Marcomanni]] dominated the entire core of the region in later centuries. Those tribes already built cities like [[Brno]], but moved west during the [[Migration Period]]. In the 7th century AD [[Slavic people]] moved in and were united under [[Samo]]'s realm. Later in the [[High Middle Ages]] Germans settled into the less populated border region.

[[File:Osadnictwo niemieckie na wschodzie.PNG|thumb|Stages of German eastern settlement, 700–1400]]
In the [[Middle Ages]] the regions situated on the mountainous border of the [[Duchy of Bohemia|Duchy]] and the [[Czech Kingdom of Bohemia]] (Crown of Saint Václav) had since the Migration Period been settled mainly by [[West Slavs|western Slavic]] [[Czechs]]. Along the [[Bohemian Forest]] in the west, the [[Czech lands]] bordered on the German Slavic tribes (German Sorbs) [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] of [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Franconia]]; [[march (territory)|marches]] of the medieval [[Kingdom of Germany|German kingdom]] had also been established in the adjacent [[March of Austria|Austrian]] lands south of the [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands]] and the northern [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] region beyond the [[Ore Mountains]]. In the course of the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' (settlement of the east) German settlement from the 13th century onwards continued to move into the [[Upper Lusatia]] region and the [[duchies of Silesia]] north of the [[Sudetes]] mountain range.

From as early as the second half of the 13th century onwards these Bohemian border regions were settled by [[ethnic Germans]], who were invited by the [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] Bohemian kings—especially by [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] (1253–1278) and [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] (1278–1305). After the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty in 1306, the Bohemian nobility backed [[John of Bohemia|John of Luxembourg]] as king against his rival Duke [[Henry of Bohemia|Henry of Carinthia]]. In 1322 King John of Bohemia acquired (for the third time) the formerly Imperial [[Egerland]] region in the west and was able to vassalize most of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] Silesian duchies, acknowledged by King [[Casimir III of Poland]] by the 1335 [[Treaty of Trentschin]]. His son, Bohemian King [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1346 and crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355. He added the [[Lusatia]]s to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], which then comprised large territories with a significant German population.

In the hilly border regions German settlers established major manufactures of [[forest glass]]. The situation of the German population was aggravated by the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434), though there were also some Germans among the [[Hussite]] insurgents.

By then Germans largely settled the hilly Bohemian border regions as well as the cities of the lowlands; mainly people of Bavarian descent in the [[South Bohemian Region|South Bohemian]] and [[South Moravian Region]], in [[Brno]], [[Jihlava]], [[České Budějovice]] and the West Bohemian [[Plzeň Region]]; Franconian people in [[Žatec]]; Upper [[Upper Saxony|Saxons]] in adjacent [[North Bohemia]], where the border with the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon Electorate]] was fixed by the 1459 [[Treaty of Eger|Peace of Eger]]; Germanic [[Silesia]]ns in the adjacent Sudetes region with the [[County of Kladsko]], in the [[Moravian–Silesian Region]], in [[Svitavy]] and [[Olomouc]]. The city of Prague had a German-speaking majority from the last third of the 17th century until 1860, but after 1910 the proportion of German speakers had decreased to 6.7% of the population.

From the Luxembourgs, the rule over Bohemia passed through [[George of Podiebrad]] to the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] and finally to the [[House of Habsburg]] in 1526. Both Czech and German Bohemians suffered heavily in the [[Thirty Years War]]. Bohemia lost 70% of its population. From the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt that collapsed at the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], the Habsburgs gradually integrated the Kingdom of Bohemia into their [[Habsburg Monarchy|monarchy]]. During the subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], less populated areas were resettled with [[Catholic Germans]] from the Austrian lands. From 1627 the Habsburgs enforced the so-called ''Verneuerte Landesordnung'' (&quot;Renewed Land's Constitution&quot;) and one of its consequences was that German according to mother tongue gradually became the primary and official language while Czech declined to a secondary role in the Empire. Also in 1749 Austrian Empire enforced German as the official language again. Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1780 renounced the coronation ceremony as Bohemian king and unsuccessfully tried to push German through as sole official language in all Habsburg lands (including Hungary). Nevertheless, German cultural influence grew stronger during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[Weimar Classicism]].

On the other hand, in the course of the [[Romanticism]] movement national tensions arose, both in the form of the [[Austroslavism]] ideology developed by Czech politicians like [[František Palacký]] and [[German nationalism in Austria|Pan-Germanist]] activist raising the [[German question]]. Conflicts between Czech and German nationalists emerged in the 19th century, for instance in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]]: while the German-speaking population of Bohemia and Moravia wanted to participate in the building of a German nation state, the Czech-speaking population insisted on keeping Bohemia out of such plans. The Bohemian Kingdom remained a part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] until its dismemberment after the [[World War I|First World War]].

===Emergence of the term===
[[File:Germans in western Austro-Hungaria.gif|thumb|Ethnic distribution in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1911: regions with a [[German language|German]] majority are depicted in pink, those with [[Czech language|Czech]] majorities in blue.]]

In the wake of growing nationalism, the name &quot;''Sudetendeutsche''{{-&quot;}} (Sudeten Germans) emerged by the early 20th century. It originally constituted part of a larger classification of three groupings of Germans within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which also included &quot;''[[Alpine Deutschen]]''{{-&quot;}} ({{lang-en|Alpine Germans}}) in what later became the Republic of Austria and &quot;''[[Balkandeutsche]]''{{-&quot;}} ({{lang-en|Balkan Germans}}) in Hungary and the regions east of it. Of these three terms, only the term &quot;''Sudetendeutsche''{{-&quot;}} survived, because of the ethnic and cultural conflicts within Bohemia.

===World War I and its aftermath===
During [[World War I]], what would later be known as the Sudetenland experienced a rate of war deaths higher than most other German-speaking areas of [[Austria-Hungary]] and exceeded only by [[German South Moravia]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Thirty-four of each 1,000 inhabitants were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

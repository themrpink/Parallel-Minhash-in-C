===Motto===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nos bras meurtris vous tendent le flambeau, à vous toujours de le porter bien haut.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To you from failing hands we throw the torch. Be yours to hold it high.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The motto is from the poem &quot;[[In Flanders Fields]]&quot; by [[John McCrae]], which was written in 1915, the year before the Canadiens won their first [[Stanley Cup]] championship. The motto appears on the wall of the Canadiens' dressing room as well as on the inside collar of the new Adidas 2017–18 jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=489201 |title=Inside the dressing room |date=August 30, 2006 |publisher=Canadiens.com |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030103122/http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=489201 |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mascot===
Beginning in the [[2004–05 NHL season]], the Canadiens adopted [[Youppi!]] as their official mascot, the first costumed mascot in their long history. Youppi was the longtime mascot for the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball team but was dropped from the franchise when they moved to Washington, D.C. in 2004 and became the [[Washington Nationals]]. With the switch, Youppi became the first mascot in professional sports to switch leagues. He is also the first mascot in professional sports to get ejected from a game.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/expos-are-gone-youppi-moves-to-the-habs-1.548418 |title=Expos are gone, Youppi! moves to the Habs |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=September 18, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214071256/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/expos-are-gone-youppi-moves-to-the-habs-1.548418 |archivedate=December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
{{Main|Bruins–Canadiens rivalry|Canadiens–Maple Leafs rivalry}}
The Canadiens have developed strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, with whom they frequently shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest is with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who first faced the Canadiens as the [[Toronto Arenas]] in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada and two of the largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's [[English Canadian|English]] and [[French Canadian|French]] linguistic divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bcf1098e-b0b3-43cc-bc60-83b96fe24d50&amp;sponsor=|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150405021846/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bcf1098e-b0b3-43cc-bc60-83b96fe24d50&amp;sponsor=|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 5, 2015|title=A rivalry like none other|work=The Gazette|location=Montreal|date=November 9, 2008|accessdate=March 31, 2015|author=Stubbs, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/opponent/Toronto-Maple-Leafs |title=Toronto Maple Leafs – Canadiens rivalry: notable moments |publisher=Montreal Canadiens official website |accessdate=March 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313172705/http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/opponent/Toronto-Maple-Leafs |archivedate=March 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938 to 1970, they were the only two Canadian teams in the league.

The Canadiens also had an intraprovincial rivalry with the [[Quebec Nordiques]] during its existence from 1979 to 1995, nicknamed the &quot;[[Battle of Quebec (ice hockey)|Battle of Quebec]].&quot;

==Broadcasting==
{{Main|List of Montreal Canadiens broadcasters}}
Montreal Canadiens games are broadcast locally in both the French and English languages. [[CHMP-FM|CHMP 98.5]] is the Canadiens' French-language radio flagship.&lt;ref name=&quot;fagstein-habs15&quot;/&gt; As of the 2017–18 season, the team's regional television in both languages, and its English-language radio rights, are held by [[Bell Media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tsn-newrights2017&quot;/&gt; [[CKGM]], ''[[TSN Radio]] 690'', is the English-language radio flagship; it acquired the rights under a seven-year deal which began in the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell Media's THE TEAM 990 Becomes Official Radio Broadcaster of the Montreal Canadiens in New Seven-Year Deal|url=http://www.bellmediapr.ca/bellmediaradio/releases/release.asp?id=13913&amp;yyyy=2011|publisher=Bell Media (press release)|accessdate=August 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408233811/http://www.bellmediapr.ca/bellmediaradio/releases/release.asp?id=13913&amp;yyyy=2011|archivedate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Bell Media reached a five-year extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsn-newrights2017&quot;/&gt;

Regional television rights in French are held by [[Réseau des sports]] (RDS) under a 12-year deal that began in the [[2014–15 NHL season]].&lt;ref name=tsn-rdscanadienscontract&gt;{{cite web|title=RDS, Canadiens announce 12-year regional rights deal |url=http://www.rds.ca/1.819879 |date=December 20, 2013 |work=RDS.ca |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529091413/http://www.rds.ca/1.819879 |archivedate=May 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister to the English-language network [[The Sports Network|TSN]], RDS was the only French-language sports channel in Canada until the 2011 launch of [[TVA Sports]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tvasports-gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Magder |first=Jason |title=New TVA Sports channel takes a shot at RDS |url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2cbb638a-16e2-4a4c-af53-92775a09989f |work=The Gazette|location=Montreal |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115249/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2cbb638a-16e2-4a4c-af53-92775a09989f |archivedate=August 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also the previous national French rightsholder of the NHL; as a result, the Canadiens forwent a separate regional contract, and allowed all of its games to be televised nationally in French as part of RDS's overall NHL rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;gandm-tvarogers&quot;/&gt;

====Hockey Hall of Fame====
The Montreal Canadiens have an affiliation with a number of inductees to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. Sixty-five inductees from the players category are affiliated with the Canadiens. Thirty-seven of these players are from three separate notable dynasties: 12 from 1955 to 1960, 11 from 1964 to 1969, and 13 from 1975 to 1979. [[Howie Morenz]] and [[Georges Vézina|Georges Vezina]] were the first Canadiens given the honour in 1945, while [[Guy Carbonneau]] was the most recently inducted, in 2019. Along with players, a number of inductees from the builders category are affiliated with the club. The first inductee was Vice-President [[William Northey]] in 1945. The most recent inductee was [[Pat Burns]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMembersByName.jsp?type=Builder|title=Legends of Hockey – Builders|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=October 31, 2014|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116070715/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMembersByName.jsp?type=Builder|archivedate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to players and builders, five broadcasters for the Montreal Canadiens were also awarded the [[Foster Hewitt Memorial Award]] from the Hockey Hall of Fame. The first two recipients of the award were [[Danny Gallivan]] and [[Rene Lecavalier]] in 1984. The other three award recipients include [[Doug Smith (sportscaster)|Doug Smith]] (1985), [[Dick Irvin Jr.]] (1988), and [[Gilles Tremblay (ice hockey)|Gilles Tremblay]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhof.com/html/leg_broadcasters.shtml|title=Foster Hewitt Memorial Award Winners|accessdate=April 12, 2018|year=2018|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ornithology''' is a branch of [[zoology]] that concerns the &quot;methodological study and consequent knowledge of birds with all that relates to them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Alfred|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/14156|title=A dictionary of birds|last2=Lydekker|first2=Richard|last3=Roy|first3=Charles S.|last4=Shufeldt|first4=Robert W.|date=1896|publisher=A. and C. Black|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, Ian|year=1998|title=Population limitation in birds|publisher=Academic Press|page=2|isbn=978-0-12-517366-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been an area with a large contribution made by amateurs in terms of time, resources, and financial support. Studies on birds have helped develop key concepts in biology including evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of [[species]], the process of [[speciation]], [[instinct]], [[learning]], [[ecological niche]]s, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]], [[island biogeography]], [[phylogeography]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mayr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayr, E.|year=1984|title=Commentary: The Contributions of Ornithology to Biology|journal=BioScience|volume=34|issue=4|pages=250–255|doi=10.2307/1309464|jstor=1309464}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species, ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories. Most modern biological theories apply across life forms, and the number of scientists who identify themselves as &quot;ornithologists&quot; has therefore declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibby2003&quot; /&gt; A wide range of tools and techniques are used in ornithology, both inside the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations are constantly made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, W.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ornithology&quot; comes from the late 16th-century Latin ''ornithologia'' meaning &quot;bird science&quot; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὄρνις ''ornis'' (&quot;bird&quot;) and λόγος ''logos'' (&quot;theory, science, thought&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ornithology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of ornithology}}
The history of ornithology largely reflects the trends in the [[history of biology]], as well as many other scientific disciplines, including [[ecology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[paleontology]], and more recently, molecular biology. Trends include the move from mere descriptions to the identification of patterns, thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these patterns.

===Early knowledge and study===
Humans have had an observational relationship with birds since [[prehistory]], with some stone-age drawings being amongst the oldest indications of an interest in birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gurney, JH 1921&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Gurney, JH |year=1921|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558 |title=Early annals of ornithology |journal=Nature|volume=108|issue=2713|pages=268|bibcode=1921Natur.108..268.|doi=10.1038/108268a0|hdl=2027/coo.31924090299532|s2cid=4033666|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bird books and bird art|author=Anker, Jean|publisher=Springer-Science|year=1979|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were perhaps important as food sources, and bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early [[Stone Age]] settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nadel, K.

However, he also introduced and propagated several myths, such as the idea that [[swallow]]s [[hibernated]] in winter, although he noted that [[common crane|cranes]] migrated from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to the marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]]. The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established that even as late as in 1878, [[Elliott Coues]] could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lincoln, Frederick C., Steven R.

The earliest record of falconry comes from the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC) in [[Assyria]]. Falconry is thought to have made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the east after invasions by the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]]. Starting from the eighth century, numerous Arabic works on the subject and general ornithology were written, as well as translations of the works of ancient writers from Greek and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries,  crusades and conquest had subjugated Islamic territories in southern Italy, central Spain, and the Levant under European rule, and for the first time translations into Latin of the great works of Arabic and Greek scholars were made with the help of Jewish and Muslim scholars, especially in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had fallen into Christian hands in 1085 and whose libraries had escaped destruction. [[Michael Scot]]us from Scotland made a Latin translation of Aristotle's work on animals from Arabic here around 1215, which was disseminated widely and was the first time in a millennium that this foundational text on zoology became available to Europeans. Falconry was popular in the [[Normans|Norman]] court in Sicily, and a number of works on the subject were written in [[Palermo]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1194–1250) learned about an falconry during his youth in Sicily and later built up a [[menagerie]] and sponsored translations of Arabic texts, among which the popular Arabic work known as the ''[[Moamyn|Liber Moaminus]]'' by an unknown author which was translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch from Syria in 1240-1241 as the ''De Scientia Venandi per Aves'', and also Michael Scotus (who had removed to Palermo) translated [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]]'s ''Kitāb al-Ḥayawān'' of 1027 for the Emperor, a commentary and scientific update of Aristotle's work which was part of Ibn Sīnā's massive ''[[The Book of Healing|Kitāb al-Šifāʾ]]''. Frederick II eventually wrote his own treatise on falconry, the ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', in which he related his ornithological observations and the results of the hunts and experiments his court enjoyed performing.&lt;ref name=&quot;egerton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egerton, F. |year=2003 |title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 8: Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen: Amateur Avian Ecologist and Behaviorist |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=40–44|url=http://esapubs.org/bulletin/current/history_list/history_part8.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[40:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Oppenraay |first=Aafke M.I. |date=2017 |title=Avicenna's ''Liber de animalibus'' ('''Abbreviatio Avicennae''') - Preliminaries and State of Affairs |url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/6003490/Avicenna_s_Liber_de_animalibus_Abbreviatio_Avicennae_._VanOppenraay_2017.pdf |journal=Documenti e Studi Sulla Tradizione Filosofica Medievale |volume=28 |pages=401–416 |access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early German and French scholars compiled old works and conducted new research on birds. These included [[Guillaume Rondelet]], who described his observations in the Mediterranean, and [[Pierre Belon]], who described the fish and birds that he had seen in France and the Levant. Belon's ''Book of Birds'' (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some 200 species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in [[comparative anatomy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;miall&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Miall, L.

Aldrovandi showed great interest in plants and animals, and his work included 3000 drawings of fruits, flowers, plants, and animals, published in 363 volumes. His ''Ornithology'' alone covers 2000 pages and included such aspects as the [[chicken]] and poultry techniques. He used a number of traits including behaviour, particularly bathing and dusting, to classify bird groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Beddall|first=Barbara G.| year=1957| title=Historical notes on avian classification| journal=Systematic Zoology| volume=6| issue=3| pages=129–136| doi=10.2307/2411751|jstor=2411751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lind, L.

[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]]'s ''Historia Avium'' (''History of Birds''), published at [[Cologne]] in 1544, was an early ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of [[red kite|kite]]s in English cities where they snatched food out of the hands of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the [[osprey]] emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times in which he lived, and stands in contrast to later works such as [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' that were written in a tranquil era.&lt;ref name=&quot;miall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilbertwhite&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |title=The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne |year= 1887 |orig-year=1789 |location=London |publisher=Cassell &amp; Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Francis Willughby]] (1635–1672) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) came up with the first major system of bird classification that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby's ''Ornithologiae libri tres'' (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on ''Ornithologia'', which was published posthumously in 1713 as ''Synopsis methodica avium et piscium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |year=1999 |title=Ornithology Collections in the Libraries at Cornell University: A Descriptive Guide |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ornithology/guide/hillguide.htm |access-date=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest list of British birds, ''Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum'', was written by [[Christopher Merrett]] in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koinm, Albert J. |year=2000 |title=Christopher Merrett's Use of Experiment |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0093|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray did, however, value the expertise of the naturalist [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82), who not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence.

Towards the late 18th century, [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] (1723–1806) and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) began new works on birds. Brisson produced a six-volume work ''Ornithologie'' in 1760 and Buffon's included nine volumes (volumes 16–24) on birds ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux'' (1770–1785) in his work on science ''Histoire naturelle générale et particulière'' (1749–1804). Jacob Temminck sponsored [[François Le Vaillant]] [1753–1824] to collect bird specimens in Southern Africa and Le Vaillant's six-volume ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique'' (1796–1808) included many non-African birds. His other bird books produced in collaboration with the artist Barraband are considered among the most valuable illustrated guides ever produced. [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] (1748–1831) spent 10 years studying North American birds and wrote the ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amerique septentrionale'' (1807–1808?). Vieillot pioneered in the use of life histories and habits in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |title=Hill Collection — 18th c.

In the early 19th century, [[Lewis and Clark]] studied and identified many birds in the western United States. [[John James Audubon]], born in 1785, observed and painted birds in France and later in the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valleys. From 1827 to 1838, Audubon published ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]'', which was engraved by [[Havell family|Robert Havell, Sr.]] and his son Robert Havell, Jr. Containing 435 engravings, it is often regarded as the greatest ornithological work in history.

===Scientific studies===
[[File:Bird eggs.jpg|thumb|left|Early bird study focused on collectibles such as eggs and nests.]]
The emergence of ornithology as a scientific discipline began in the 18th century, when [[Mark Catesby]] published his two-volume ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands'', a landmark work which included 220 hand-painted engravings and was the basis for many of the species [[Carl Linnaeus]] described in the 1758 ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''. Linnaeus' work revolutionised bird taxonomy by assigning every species a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], categorising them into different genera. However, ornithology did not emerge as a specialised science until the Victorian era—with the popularization of natural history, and the collection of natural objects such as bird eggs and skins.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, David E.|year=1994|title=The naturalist in Britain: a social history|isbn=978-0691036328|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farber, Paul L.|year=1982|title=The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760–1850|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialization led to the formation in Britain of the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] in 1858. In 1859, the members founded its journal ''[[The Ibis]]''. The sudden spurt in ornithology was also due in part to [[colonialism]]. At 100 years later, in 1959, [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R. E. Moreau]] noted that ornithology in this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions of various species of birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibis-history&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Kristin|year=2004|title=''The Ibis'': Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=37|pages=515–555| doi=10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3|issue=3|s2cid=83849594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

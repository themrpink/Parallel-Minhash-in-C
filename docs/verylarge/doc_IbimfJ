The suppression of gunrunning is one of the areas of increasing interest{{Ambiguous|date=November 2020}} in the context of [[international law]]. Examples of past and current gunrunning include:
* [[Iran–Contra affair]]
* [[Larne gun-running]]
* [[Provisional Irish Republican Army arms importation]]

In the United States, the term &quot;[[Iron Pipeline]]&quot; is sometimes used to describe [[Interstate Highway 95]] and its connector highways as a corridor for arms trafficking into New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enos&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Enos |first=Sandra L. |title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2012 |isbn=9780313386701 |editor-last=Gregg Lee Carter |pages=440–44 |chapter=Iron Pipeline |access-date=7 May 2015 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD46JBOhMU0C&amp;pg=PA440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
During the [[Mexican Revolution]], gunrunning into Mexico reached rampant levels with the majority of the arms being smuggled from the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Alan |title=The Mexican Revolution: Porfirians, Liberals, and Peasants  |date=1986 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0803277709}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} As Mexico manufactured no weapons of its own, acquiring arms and bullets were one of the main concerns of the various rebels, intent on armed revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight1&quot; /&gt;{{rp|198–199}} Under American law at the time, arms smugglers into Mexico could be prosecuted only if one was caught ''in flagrante delicto'' crossing the border as merely buying arms with the intention of gunrunning into Mexico was not a criminal offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight1&quot; /&gt;{{rp|186}} Given the length and often rugged terrain of the American-Mexican border, the undermanned American border service simply could not stop the massive gunrunning into Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight1&quot; /&gt;{{rp|186}}

In February 1913-February 1914, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] imposed an arms embargo on both sides of the Mexican civil war, and not until February 1914 was the embargo lifted on arms sales to the Constitutionalist rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Alan |title=The Mexican Revolution: Counter-revolution and reconstruction |date=1990 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0803277709}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} Despite the arms embargo, there was much gunrunning into Mexico, as one American official complained in 1913: &quot;our border towns are practically their commissary and quartermaster depots&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight2&quot; /&gt;{{rp|31}} Guns were smuggled into Mexico via barrels, coffins, and false bottoms of automobiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight2&quot; /&gt;{{rp|31}} General Huerta avoided the American arms embargo by buying weapons from Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight2&quot; /&gt;{{rp|154}}

==== Liberia and Sierra Leone conflicts ====
The [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war in Sierra Leone]] lasted from 1991–2002, and left 75,000 people dead. Gunrunning played a significant role in this conflict. Weapons of all sorts were shipped to all sides in both [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Liberia]] from abroad. These included [[small arms]], such as, [[Pistol|pistols]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], grenades, [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymores]], knives, machetes, etc. Larger weapons such as missiles, light machine guns, mortars, anti-tank missiles, tanks, and planes were also used. During this time a civil war was occurring in nearby Liberia. The [[Liberian Civil War (disambiguation)|Liberian Civil Wars]] took place from 1989 through 1997. The war was between the existing government and the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|National Patriotic Front]]. Leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], helped to create the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) in Sierra Leone. Taylor was the recipient of thousands of illegally trafficked arms from eastern Europe (mostly the Ukraine). Taylor then sold some of these weapons to the RUF in exchange for diamonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rothe |first1=Dawn L. |last2=Ross |first2=Jeffrey Ian |date=2012 |title=How States Facilitate Small Arms Trafficking in Africa: A Theoretical and Juristic Interpretation |url=http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2427762 |journal=SSRN Working Paper Series |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2427762 |issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; President of Burkina Faso, [[Blaise Compaoré|Blaise Compaore]], “directly facilitated Liberia’s arms-for-diamonds trade” with Liberia and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Compaore would give guns to Taylor, who would then sell them to the RUF in exchange for diamonds. These [[blood diamond]]s would then be sold back to Compaore for more guns. The cyclical exchange allowed Compaore the ability to deny directly sending arms to Sierra Leone.[[Image:Gun pyre in Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A tower of confiscated smuggled weapons about to be set ablaze in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]]]

The Liberian government received arms through an elaborate front company in [[Guinea]]. The arms were intended to be shipped (legally) from [[Uganda]] to [[Slovakia]]. However, the arms were diverted to Guinea as a part of “an elaborate bait and switch.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Additionally the British government “encouraged [[Sandline International]], a private security firm and non state entity, to supply arms and ammunitions to the loyal forces of the exiled government of President Kabbah.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schabas |first=William |title=Truth Commissions and Courts |date=2004 |pages=3–54 |editor-last=Schabas |editor-first=William |chapter=A Synergistic Relationship: The Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court for Sierra Leone |publisher=Springer Netherlands |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-3237-0_1 |isbn=9781402032233 |editor2-last=Darcy |editor2-first=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandline proceeded 35 tons of arms from Bulgaria, to Kabbah's forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

====The South Sudanese civil war====
Ever since the [[South Sudanese civil war]] began in December 2013, gunrunning into that nation has reached rampant levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Martell |first=Peter |title=First Raise a Flag: How South Sudan Won the Longest War But Lost the Peace |date=2019 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0190052706 |location=Oxford |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[South Sudan]] has hardly any electricity and no manufacturing, both sides were entirely dependent upon buying arms from abroad to fight their war. President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] used shadowy networks of arms dealers from China, Uganda, Israel, Egypt and the Ukraine to arm his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; As oil companies paid rent for their concessions in South Sudan, the government was able to afford to buy arms on a lavish scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; In June 2014, the government's National Security Service signed a deal worth $264 million US dollars with a Seychelles-based shell company to buy 30 tanks, 50, 000 AK-47 assault rifles and 20 million bullets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; Just who controls the shell company remains a mystery. In July 2014, the Chinese arms manufacturer [[Norinco]] delivered a shipment to South Sudan of 95, 000 assault rifles and 20 million rounds of ammunition, supplying enough bullets to kill every person in South Sudan twice over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; The American arms dealer and private military contractor, [[Erik Prince]], sold to the government for $43 million dollars three Mi-24 attack helicopters and two L-39 jets together with the services of Hungarian mercenary pilots to operate the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; The majority of the arms supplied to South Sudan from Uganda originated from Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, all which are members of the European Union (EU), and were supposed to abide by an EU arms embargo placed on South Sudan in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tut Pur&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tut Pur |first=Nyagoah |date=8 May 2019 |title=South Sudan's Arms Embargo Flouted |publisher=Human Rights Watch |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/08/south-sudans-arms-embargo-flouted |access-date=22 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Less is known about the very secretive arms dealers supplying the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition]] (SPLM-IO) led by [[Riek Machar]] other than that the majority of the gunrunners appeared to be European.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; A rare exception was with the Franco-Polish arms dealer [[Pierre Dadak]] who was arrested on 14 July 2016 at his villa in [[Ibiza]] on charges of gunrunning into South Sudan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt; At his villa, the Spanish [[National Police Corps]] allege that they found documents showing he was negotiating to sell Machar 40, 000 AK-47 assault rifles, 30, 000 PKM machine guns and 200, 000 boxes of ammunition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martell&quot; /&gt;

The United Nations Panel of Experts on South Sudan in a 2017 report declared: &quot;Reports from independent sources indicate that the border areas between South Sudan and the Sudan and Uganda remain key entry points for arms, with some unsubstantiated reports of smaller numbers of weapons also crossing into South Sudan from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are also persistent reports and public accusations of shipments to forces affiliated with the leadership in Juba from further afield, specifically from Egypt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allimadi&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Allimadi |first=Milton |date=24 April 2017 |title=UN Panel Wants Arms Embargo on South Sudan |publisher=Black Star News |url=https://www.blackstarnews.com/global-politics/africa/un-panel-wants-arms-embargo-on-south-sudan-calls-president}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report stated that a Ukrainian Air Force IL-76 transport jet flew in two L-39 jets to Uganda on 27 January 2017 in the full knowledge the L-39 jets were intended to go on to South Sudan, thereby violating the arms embargo the Ukraine had placed on arms sales to South Sudan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allimadi&quot; /&gt; In 2018, the United Nations Security Council imposed a worldwide arms embargo on South Sudan, but the embargo has been widely ignored where despite a ceasefire signed the same year, both sides have continued to import arms on a massive scale, suggesting that they are preparing for another bout of the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tut Pur&quot; /&gt;

==== Why traffickers choose Africa ====
Kimberly Thachuk and Karen Saunders argue that arms trafficking is no different from any other illegal business in their work ''Under the Radar: Airborne Arms Trafficking Operations in Africa''. Traffickers first need a headquarters, or somewhere to base their operations. A headquarters needs several aspects to make it an ideal place to traffic weapons. First, the headquarters should have appropriate infrastructure. For a weapons trafficking this would include a landing strip for both importation and exportation. Additionally, warehouses are needed to “store product awaiting delivery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Thachuk |first1=Kimberley |last2=Saunders |first2=Karen |date=September 2014 |title=Under the Radar: Airborne Arms Trafficking Operations in Africa |journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361–378 |doi=10.1007/s10610-014-9247-5 |s2cid=144051979 |issn=0928-1371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the product has arrived and been stored it needs to be delivered to the customer, thus, the headquarters should be in somewhat of a central location near each customer. While not the primary reason traffickers choose Africa, it has multitudes of unoccupied land that can be used by traffickers, as is asserted by Thachuk and Saunders.

Physical space is important but the rules and regulations of said space are also relevant. Traffickers look for places with corrupt, supply side, officials that can either be bribed, or blackmailed. This allows the trafficker to “circumvent the regulatory and oversight systems” put in place by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, a “lax financial system” is key so the large amounts of money moved by the trafficker are not seen as suspicious.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

Thachuk and Saunders finish their argument, a stable, and highly centralized government, is important. They then point out that 10 different African countries have leaders that have been in power for more than 20 years, which they argue meets the criteria a highly centralized and stable government.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Europe ===
Since 1996, countries throughout Europe have taken notice of arms trafficking. Europe has been an overall large exporter of illicit weapons with the United Kingdom, Germany, and France in the national lead for the most exports. Imports to Europe in from 2004-2013 have decreased by 25%, with the United Kingdom importing the most overall in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;Arsovska, Jana. &quot;Introduction: Illicit Firearms Market in Europe and Beyond.&quot;''European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research'', vol. 20, no. 3, 2014, pp. 295-305''. ProQuest'', doi:10.1007/s10610-014-9254-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The firearms that are imported and passed around are commonly [[small arms]] and lighter weapons ([[Small Arms and Light Weapons|SALW]]) compared to large machinery, such as [[tank]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Greene |first=Owen |title=Under the Counter and over the Border |date=2000 |pages=151–190 |chapter=Examining international responses to illicit arms trafficking |publisher=Springer Netherlands |doi=10.1007/978-94-015-9335-9_6 |isbn=9789048155699}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SALW bought in Europe tends to be secondhand weapons that are cheap and regularly available. Gun cultures, such as in Germany, where the &quot;taken-for-granted cultural practice of carrying a handgun,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; increases illicit SALW because guns are viewed as a way to enhance masculinity and status. In 2000, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]] started on regional solutions and security measures to address the firearms trafficking problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;

==Global market value==
The total value of the global arms market is estimated around $60 billion a year, with around $8 billion attributed to pistols, rifles, machine guns, and bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Whitney, Craig R. |date=December 2012 |title=Ruling Arms |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/ruling-arms |url-status=dead |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=86–93 |doi=10.1177/0740277512470932 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228041202/http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/ruling-arms |archive-date=2012-12-28 |access-date=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of legal transparency, estimating the [[market value]] of the arms trafficking industry is sometimes difficult. In 2001 alone, the value of legal [[Small Arms and Light Weapons]] exports was US$2.4 Billion. After being processed by [[customs]], that number increases to somewhere between US$5–7 Billion, according to [[Small Arms and Light Weapons]] (1994-2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Brauer |first=Jurgen |title=Handbook of Defense Economics - Defense in a Globalized World |date=2007 |volume=2 |pages=973–1015 |series=Handbook of Defense Economics |chapter=Chapter 30 Arms Industries, Arms Trade, and Developing Countries |publisher=Elsevier |language=en |doi=10.1016/s1574-0013(06)02030-8 |isbn=9780444519108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 10-20% (US$1 Billion) are suspected to be added to that number from [[black market]] transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Costa |first=Antonio Maria |date=2010 |title=The economics of crime: A discipline to be invented and a Nobel Prize to be awarded |journal=Journal of Policy Modeling |language=en |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=648–661 |doi=10.1016/j.jpolmod.2010.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AK-47|Kalashnikov AK-47]] is the most appealing weapon to the illegal weapons trade due to its low cost. With a surplus of [[AK-47]]s flooding the market from post-cold war armies, the prices of this firearm sunk as low as US$15 in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; Trends have shown that the price of the [[AK-47]] have stayed constant in countries with current [[civil war]]s, while stable countries prices for the [[AK-47]] have been on the rise. Even biker gangs have gotten in on profitable arms trafficking. United States [[Law Enforcement Agencies|Law enforcement agencies]] started investigating [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bike gangs]] in the late 90s, and started classifying them as organized criminal organizations. This was mainly due to the fact that they were able to get control of the prostitution market and the smuggling of stolen goods such as weapons, motorcycles, and car parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Piano |first=Ennio E. |date=2018-08-01 |title=Outlaw and economics: Biker gangs and club goods |journal=Rationality and Society |language=en |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=350–376 |doi=10.1177/1043463117743242 |s2cid=149027132 |issn=1043-4631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
In the international criminal scholarly community, [[Rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]] is commonly referenced in explanations as to why individuals engage in and justify criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masucci |first=David J. |date=2013 |title=Mexican Drug Activity, Economic Development, and Unemployment in a Rational Choice Framework |url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/755/mexican-drug-activity-economic-development-and-unemployment-in-a-rational-choice-framework |journal=Inquiries Journal |language=en |volume=5 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jana Arsovska and Panos Kostakos, leading scholars on [[organized crime]], the causes of arms trafficking are not solely based on rational choice theory but rather have been more closely linked to the intimacy of one's personal social networks as well as the &quot;perception of risks, effort and rewards in violating criminal laws.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

He shared the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the development of the semiconductor [[heterojunction]] for optoelectronics. He also became a politician in his later life, serving in the [[lower house]] of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian parliament]], the [[State Duma]], as a member of [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|the communist party]] since 1995.

==Early life and education==
Alferov was born in [[Vitebsk]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], to a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] father, Ivan Karpovich Alferov, a factory manager, and a Jewish mother, Anna Vladimirovna Rosenblum.&lt;ref name=lenta&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Алферов, Жорес|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14177331/full.htm|work=Lenta|language=Russian|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Nobelprize}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after French socialist [[Jean Jaurès]] while his older brother was named Marx after [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=lenta/&gt; Alferov graduated from secondary school in Minsk in 1947 and started Belarusian Polytechnic Academy. In 1952, he received his B.S. from the [[Saint Petersburg State Electrotechnical University|V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Electrotechnical Institute]] (LETI) in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. Starting in 1953, Alferov worked in the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]. From the Institute, he earned several scientific degrees: a Candidate of Sciences in Technology in 1961 and a Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Mathematics in 1970.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Alferov then served as the director of the Ioffe Institute from 1987&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; to 2003. He was elected a corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in 1972, and a full member in 1979. From 1989, he was Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences and President of its [[Saint Petersburg]] Scientific Center. In 1995 he became a member of the [[State Duma]] on the list of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

==Research==
Starting at Ioffe Institute in 1953, Alferov worked with a group led by Vladimir Tuchkevich, who became director of the Ioffe Institute in 1967, on planar semiconductor amplifiers for use in radio receivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephson2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Josephson, Paul R. |title=Lenin's Laureate: Zhores Alferov's Life in Communist Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcXxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date= 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125–128}} These planar semiconductor amplifiers would be referred to as transistors in the present day. Alferov's contribution included work on germanium diodes for use as a rectifier.

In the early 1960s, Alferov organized an effort at Ioffe Institute to develop [[semiconductor]] [[heterostructures]]. [[Heterojunction|Semiconductor heterojunctions]] transistors enabled higher frequency use than their [[homojunction]] predecessors, and this capability plays a key role in modern mobile phone and satellite communications.  Alferov and colleagues worked on [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] and [[Aluminium arsenide|AlAs]] [[III-V]] heterojunctions. A particular focus was the use of heterojunctions to create [[semiconductor lasers]] capable of lasing at room temperature. In 1963, Alferov filed a patent application proposing double-heterostructure lasers; [[Herbert Kroemer]] independently filed a US patent several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Yuri|year=2004|title=On the history of the invention of the injection laser|journal=Physics-Uspekhi|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1068–1070|doi=10.1070/PU2004v047n10ABEH002077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseyPanish1978&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Casey, Horace Craig |author2=Panish, M. B. |title=Heterostructure lasers: Fundamental principles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qN9RAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-163101-7|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Alferov's lab created the first lasers based on heterostructures, although they did not lase continuously. Then in 1968, Alferov and coworkers produced the first continuous-wave semiconductor heterojunction laser operating at room temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephson2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|163–167}}  This achievement came a month ahead of [[Izuo Hayashi]] and [[Morton Panish]] of [[Bell Labs]] also producing a continuous-wave room-temperature heterojunction laser.&lt;ref name=Hecht2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Jeff|title=City of light : the story of fiber optics|year=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=9780195162554|pages=151–155|edition=Rev. and expanded }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was for this work that Alferov received the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Herbert Kroemer]], &quot;for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and optoelectronics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/alferov/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s Alferov continued his work on the physics and technology of semiconductor heterostructures in his lab at the Ioffe Institute.  Alferov's investigations of injection properties of semiconductors and his contributions to the development of [[laser]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[LED]]s, and [[epitaxy]] processes, led to the creation of modern heterojunction physics and electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The development of semiconductor heterojunctions revolutionized semiconductor design, and had a range of immediate commercial applications including [[LEDs]], barcode readers and CDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Hermann Grimmeiss]] of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said: &quot;Without Alferov, it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the Earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/965528.stm|title=Russian and Americans share hi-tech Nobel|date=10 October 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alferov had an almost messianic conception of heterostructures, writing:  &quot;Many scientists have contributed to this remarkable progress, which not only determines in large measure the future prospects of solid state physics but in a certain sense affects the future of human society as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/selected%20papers/semiconductors/32-1.pdf Lib.semi.ac.cn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013108/http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/selected%20papers/semiconductors/32-1.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific administration==

In 1987, Alferov became the fifth director of the Ioffe Institute.  In 1989, Alferov gained the administrative position of chairman of the Leningrad Scientific Center, now referred to as the St. Petersburg Scientific Center.  In the Leningrad region, this scientific center is an overarching organization comprising 70 institutions, organizations, enterprises, and scientific societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephson2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|196}}  As a director and chairman, Alferov sought to ensure support for scientific research through a time of changing political and economic conditions.

Alferov worked to foster relationships between early educational institutions and scientific research institutions to train the next generation of scientists, citing [[Peter the Great]]'s vision for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] to be organized with a scientific research core in close contact with a gymnasium (secondary school).&lt;ref name=&quot;Josephson2010&quot;/&gt;{{rp|199}} In 1987, Alferov and colleagues at the Ioffe Institute established a secondary school in Saint Petersburg, the School of Physics and Technology, under the umbrella of the Ioffe charter. In 1997 Alferov founded the Research and Education Center at the Ioffe Institute and in 2002, this center officially became a new university, the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], after gaining a charter to award masters and PhD degrees.  In 2009, the Saint Petersburg Academic University was reorganized to officially combine the secondary school, School of Physics and Technology, within the organizational structure of the university, closely linking scientific education to research.

In the 2000s, through his role in academic administration and in parliament, Alferov advocated for and worked to advance Russia's [[nanotechnology]] sector. The primary research charter of the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], which Alferov founded, was the development of [[nanotechnology]].  Alferov provided a consistent voice in parliament in favor of increased scientific funding. In 2006, Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]] announced the creation of a federal agency, [[Rusnano|Rosnanotekh]] to pursue nanotechnology applications.

==Political activity==

Alferov was elected to the Russian Parliament, the [[State Duma]], in 1995 as a deputy for the political party [[Our Home is Russia]], generally considered to be supportive of the [[Presidency of Boris Yeltsin|policies of President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In 1999 he was [[1999 Russian legislative election|elected again]], this time on the list of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. He was [[2003 Russian legislative election|re-elected]] in 2003 and [[2007 Russian legislative election|again]] in 2007, when he was placed second on the party's federal electoral list behind [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and ahead of [[Nikolai Kharitonov]], even though he was not a member of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commersant.com/p802109/elections_/ Communists, Patriots Name Their Leaders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072804/http://www.commersant.com/p802109/elections_/ |date=22 July 2011 }}, Kommersant, 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the signers of the [[Academicians' letter|Open letter to the President Vladimir V. Putin from the Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazeta.ru/science/2019/03/02_a_12218221.shtml|title=&quot;Великий по всем меркам&quot;: умер Жорес Алферов|website=Газета.Ru|access-date=2 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alferov was an atheist and expressed objections to religious education.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Prominent Russians: Zhores Alferov&quot;. RT (TV network). Retrieved 21 April 2012. In public life the scientist was a strong supporter of communism, an atheist strongly objecting to advancement of religious education in Russia, and proponent of science and knowledge as the means to see a better future.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-profit service==
Alferov served on the advisory council of [[CRDF Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Zhores I.

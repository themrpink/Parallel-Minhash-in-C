==History==
{{For|the pre-1954 history|Kashmir#History}}

=== Establishment ===
After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948]], the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] was divided between India (which controlled the regions of [[Jammu]], [[Kashmir Valley]], and [[Ladakh]]) and Pakistan (which controlled [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]]). The Indian-administered territories elected a [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir|constituent assembly]] in 1951, which ratified the accession of the state to India in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica-kashmir&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Schofield&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Schofield|2003|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956–57, China constructed a road through the disputed [[Aksai Chin]] area of Ladakh. India's belated discovery of this road culminated in the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962; China has since administered Aksai Chin.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica-kashmir&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Kashmir-region-Indian-subcontinent|title=Kashmir – region, Indian subcontinent|access-date=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005093248/https://www.britannica.com/place/Kashmir-region-Indian-subcontinent|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], India and Pakistan signed the [[Simla Agreement]], recognising a [[Line of Control]] in Kashmir, and committing to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through [[India-Pakistan relations|bilateral negotiations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kashmir Fast Facts |url=https://edition-m.cnn.com/2013/11/08/world/kashmir-fast-facts/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.in%2F |website=CNN |access-date=12 January 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

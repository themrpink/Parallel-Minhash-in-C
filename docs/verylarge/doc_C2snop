'''''A Streetcar Named Desire''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[Tennessee Williams]] that was first performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 3, 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;play&quot; /&gt; The play dramatizes the experiences of [[Blanche DuBois]], a former [[Southern belle]] who, after encountering a series of personal losses, leaves behind her privileged background to move into a shabby apartment in [[New Orleans]] that her younger sister and brother-in-law have rented. 

Williams' most popular work, ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', is considered one of the finest and most critically acclaimed plays of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;play&quot;&gt;Williams, Tennessee (1995). ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. Introduction and text. Oxford: [[Heinemann Educational Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; It still ranks among his most performed plays, and has inspired many adaptations in other forms, notably producing a [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|critically acclaimed film]] that was released in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdb&quot;&gt;Production notes.

==Plot==
[[File:Jessica Tandy with Kim Hunter and Marlon Brando. cph.3b23243.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jessica Tandy]], [[Kim Hunter]] and [[Marlon Brando]] in the original Broadway production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1947)]]
After the loss of her family home to creditors, [[Blanche DuBois]] travels from the small town of [[Laurel, Mississippi]], to the New Orleans [[French Quarter]] to live with her younger married sister, [[Stella Kowalski|Stella]], and Stella's husband, [[Stanley Kowalski]]. Blanche is in her thirties and, with no money, has nowhere else to go.

Blanche tells Stella that she has taken a leave of absence from her English-teaching position because of her nerves (which is later revealed to be a lie). Blanche laments the shabbiness of her sister's two-room flat. She finds Stanley loud and rough, eventually referring to him as &quot;common&quot;. Stanley, in return, does not care for Blanche's manners and dislikes her presence.

Stanley later questions Blanche about her earlier marriage. Blanche had married when she was very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried that he has been cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is going to have a baby. This can be seen as the start of Blanche's mental upheaval.

The night after Blanche's arrival, during one of Stanley's poker games, Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley's poker player buddies. His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they like each other. Suddenly becoming upset over multiple interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit at the bottom of the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley's coarse behavior.

Blanche is bewildered that Stella would go back to her abusive husband after such violence. The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and describes Stanley as subhuman, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine. Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.

As the weeks pass, the friction between Blanche and Stanley continues to grow. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella that she wants to go away with him and not be anyone's problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later took his own life when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other.

Later on, Stanley repeats gossip to Stella that he has gathered on Blanche, telling her that Blanche was fired from her teaching job for involvement with an under-aged student and that she lived at a hotel known for prostitution. Stella erupts in anger over Stanley's cruelty after he states that he has also told Mitch about the rumors, but the fight is cut short as she goes into labor and is sent to the hospital.

As Blanche waits at home alone, Mitch arrives and confronts Blanche with the stories that Stanley has told him. At first she denies everything, but eventually confesses that the stories are true. She pleads for forgiveness. An angry and humiliated Mitch rejects her.

As Stella is checked-in to give birth, Stanley and Blanche are left alone in the apartment. Blanche has descended into another fantasy that an old suitor of hers is coming to provide financial support and take her away from New Orleans. Stanley goes along with the act before angrily scorning Blanche's lies, hypocrisy and behavior, and advances toward her; in response, she threatens to attack him with a broken bottle, but is overpowered. Blanche collapses on the floor and Stanley is last seen taking her unconscious into his bed.

At another poker game at the Kowalski apartment, Stella and her neighbor, Eunice, are packing Blanche's belongings while Blanche takes a bath in a catatonic state, having suffered a mental breakdown. Although Blanche has told Stella about Stanley's assault, Stella cannot bring herself to believe her sister's story. When a doctor and a matron arrive to take Blanche to the hospital, she initially resists them and collapses on the floor in confusion. Mitch, present at the poker game, breaks down in tears. When the doctor helps Blanche up, she goes willingly with him, saying: &quot;Whoever you are – I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.&quot; The play ends with Stanley continuing to comfort a crying Stella, while the poker game continues uninterrupted and one of the players says: &quot;This game is seven-card stud.&quot;

===Original Broadway production===

|caption2=[[Carl Van Vechten]] portrait photograph of [[Marlon Brando]] during the Broadway production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (December 27, 1948)}}
The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was produced by [[Irene Mayer Selznick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdb&quot;/&gt; It opened at the Shubert in New Haven in early November 1947, then played the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia before moving to the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on December 3, 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdb&quot; /&gt; Selznick originally wanted to cast [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[John Garfield]], but settled on [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Marlon Brando]], who were virtual unknowns at the time. The opening night cast also included [[Kim Hunter]] as Stella and [[Karl Malden]] as Mitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdb&quot;/&gt; Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play ''[[Portrait of a Madonna]]''. Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded the debut performance.&lt;ref&gt;December 3, ''This Day In History Calendar (2008).'' Sourcebooks, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Brooks Atkinson]], reviewing the opening in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Tandy's &quot;superb performance&quot; as &quot;almost incredibly true,&quot; concluding that Williams &quot;has spun a poignant and luminous story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks Atkinson, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/23/theater/20120423-streetcar.html?_r=0 &quot;First Night at the Theatre&quot;], ''New York Times'', December 4, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in the run, [[Uta Hagen]] replaced Tandy, [[Carmelita Pope]] replaced Hunter, and [[Anthony Quinn]] replaced Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour and then returned to Broadway for additional performances. Early on, when Brando broke his nose, [[Jack Palance]] took over his role. [[Ralph Meeker]] also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Play in 1948, sharing the honor with [[Judith Anderson]]'s portrayal of [[Medea]] and with [[Katharine Cornell]].

[[Uta Hagen]]'s Blanche on the national tour was directed not by [[Elia Kazan]], who had directed the Broadway production, but by [[Harold Clurman]], and it has been reported, both in interviews by Hagen and observations by contemporary critics, that the Clurman-directed interpretation shifted the focus of audience sympathy back to Blanche and away from Stanley (where the Kazan version had located it). This was the original conception of the play, and has been reflected in subsequent revivals.

The original Broadway production closed, after 855 performances, in 1949.

In 2018, it headlined the third annual Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis at the Grandel Theatre. Carrie Houk, the Festival's Executive Artistic Director, and Tim Ocel, the director of the play, chose to cast the play with actors whose ages were close to Tennessee Williams' original intentions.

Henry Polkes composed the original score, and James Wolk designed the set.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
[[File:Vivien Leigh in Streetcar Named Desire trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vivien Leigh]] in the trailer for ''A Streetcar Named Desire'']]{{Main|A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)}}

In 1951, [[Warner Bros.]] released [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|a film adaptation of the play]], directed by [[Elia Kazan]]. Malden, Brando, and Hunter reprised their Broadway roles. They were joined by [[Vivien Leigh]] from the London production in the part of Blanche. The movie won four [[Academy Awards]], including three acting awards (Leigh for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], Malden for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and Hunter for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]), the first time a film won three out of four acting awards (Brando was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] but lost). Composer [[Alex North]] received an Academy Award nomination for this, his first film score. Jessica Tandy was the only lead actor from the original Broadway production not to appear in the 1951 film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohan1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohan |first =Steven |page=254 |title=Masked Men: Masculinity and the Movies in the Fifties |location=Bloomington, Indiana |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-253-21127-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UACyelofecEC&amp;q=%22allan+gray%22+suicide+blanche&amp;pg=PA254 |accessdate=July 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending itself was also slightly altered. Stella does not remain with Stanley, as she does in the play.

[[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s 1999 [[Academy Award]]-winning film, ''[[All About My Mother]]'', features a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version of the play being performed by some of the supporting characters and the play itself plays an important role in the film. However, some of the film's dialogue is taken from the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.

The 1973 [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' includes a late scene in which Miles (Woody) and Luna ([[Diane Keaton]]) briefly take on the roles of Stanley (Luna) and Blanche (Miles).

It was noted by many critics that the 2013 Academy Award-winning [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Blue Jasmine]]'' had much in common with ''Streetcar'' and is most likely a loose adaptation. It shares a very similar plot and characters, although it has been suitably updated for modern film audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Review: Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine Is Perhaps His Cruelest-Ever Film|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/07/movie-review-blue-jasmine-woody-allen|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Jasmine: Woody Allen's excellent homage to A Streetcar Named Desire|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/08/22/2529785/blue-jasmine-woody-allens-excellent.html|work=[[Tri-city Herald]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429161626/http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/08/22/2529785/blue-jasmine-woody-allens-excellent.html|archive-date=April 29, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Gillian Anderson]] directed and starred in a short film [[prequel]] to ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', titled ''The Departure''. The short film was written by the novelist [[Andrew O'Hagan]] and is part of [[Young Vic]]'s short film series, which was produced in collaboration with ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/05/gillian-anderson-blanche-streetcar-named-desire-prequel-young-vic-departure|title=Gillian Anderson goes back to Blanche for prequel to A Streetcar Named Desire|last=Wiegand|first=Chris|date=February 5, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
In 1995, [[A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)|an opera]] was adapted and composed by [[André Previn]] with a libretto by Philip Littell. It had its premiere at the [[San Francisco Opera]] during the 1998–99 season, and featured [[Renée Fleming]] as Blanche.

===Ballet===

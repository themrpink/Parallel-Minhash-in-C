He is currently serving a six-year ban from participating in FIFA activities.

From a background in business, public relations, and sports administration, Blatter became general secretary of FIFA in 1981 and was then elected president at the [[51st FIFA Congress]] on 8 June 1998, succeeding [[João Havelange]], who had headed the organization since 1974. Blatter was reelected in 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2015. Like his predecessor Havelange, Blatter sought to increase the influence of African and Asian countries in world football through the expansion of participating teams in various FIFA tournaments.

He has persistently been dogged by claims of corruption and financial mismanagement. Blatter's reign oversaw a vast expansion in revenues generated by the FIFA World Cup accompanied by the collapse of the marketing company [[International Sport and Leisure]] and numerous allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the awarding of FIFA tournaments.

On 2 June 2015, six days after the United States government [[2015 FIFA corruption case|indicted several current and former FIFA officials]] and sports marketing companies for bribery and money laundering,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyti_Afte&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = After Indicting 14 Soccer Officials, U.S. Vows to End Graft in FIFA | last1 = Clifford | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Apuzzo | first2 = Matt | work = The New York Times | date = 27 May 2015 | access-date = 2 June 2015 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blatter announced that he would call for elections to choose a new president of FIFA and that he would not stand in these elections, but he also said he would remain in his position until an [[2016 FIFA Extraordinary Congress|extraordinary FIFA Congress]] could be held for his successor to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2015/m=6/news=fifa-president-to-lay-down-his-mandate-at-extraordinary-elective-congr-2617742.html |title=FIFA President to lay down his mandate at extraordinary elective Congress |date=2 June 2015 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Blatter and other top FIFA officials were suspended amid the investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-michel-platini-jerome-valcke-fifa-suspended.html?_r=0 |title=FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Other Top Officials Suspended |access-date=8 October 2015 |date=8 October 2015 |newspaper=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December the independent [[FIFA Ethics Committee]] ejected Blatter from office and banned him from taking part in any FIFA activities over the following eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Evans|first=Simon|date=21 December 2015|title=Blatter and Platini banned by FIFA for eight years|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-idUSKBN0U40S320151221|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six.&lt;ref name=BBCSport&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/35655454 ''Sepp Blatter &amp; Michel Platini lose Fifa appeals but bans reduced''], [[BBC Sport]], 24 February 2016.

== Early life ==
Blatter was born in [[Visp]] in the Swiss [[Valais|canton of Valais]] with the given name of ''Josef''. He studied in [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint Maurice]], before getting a degree in business and economics from the [[University of Lausanne]] in 1959. Blatter has had a long and varied career, including posts such as head of public relations for the tourist board of his native canton, as well as general secretary of the [[Schweizerischer Eishockeyverband|Swiss Ice Hockey Federation]].

He was Director of Sports Timing and Relations of [[Longines]] S.A., and was involved in the organization of the 1972 and 1976 [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubbard&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/korea-move-is-a-blow-for-blatter-686063.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Korea move is a blow for Blatter | first=Alan | last=Hubbard | date=27 May 2001 | access-date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/worldcup06/2006/06/29/wrong_again.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | access-date=23 May 2010 | title=Wrong again | date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/homegrown-revolution-1403718.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Daniel | last=McDonnell | title=Home-grown revolution | date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FIFA ==
[[File:Sepp Blatter &amp; João Havelange.jpg|right|thumb|Blatter (left) with [[João Havelange]], President of FIFA (April 1982).]]

From 1975 onwards, Blatter worked at FIFA, first as [[technical director]] (1975–1981), then general secretary (1981–1998), before his election as [[FIFA president]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph &quot;Sepp&quot; Blatter elected new FIFA president |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/head4.sml |work=Fox Sports |date=8 June 1998 |access-date=1 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980610163933/http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/head4.sml |archive-date=10 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected as head of FIFA in 2002, and was re-elected unopposed for another four years on 31 May 2007, even though only 66 of 207 FIFA members nominated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6518647.stm |title=Blatter set for third FIFA term |access-date=3 April 2007 |date=2 April 2007 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blatter and FIFA have often been dogged by controversy and allegations of corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyti_Afte&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/fifa-scandal-explained/|title=Everything You Need to Know About FIFA's Corruption Scandal|date=27 May 2015|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32917364|title=Fifa corruption inquiry: Sepp Blatter defies calls to quit|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure has seen controversy over allegations of financial mismanagement and the acceptance of bribes resulting in Qatar's successful [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] bid.

Blatter has attracted criticism from the media, senior football figures and players,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8896336/Sepp-Blatter-responds-directly-to-Rio-Ferdinand-on-Twitter-as-Fifa-president-criticised-over-racism-comments.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Luke | last=Edwards | title=Sepp Blatter responds directly to Rio Ferdinand on Twitter as Fifa president criticised over racism comments | date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to controversial statements. These include the claim that [[Latin American]] countries would applaud [[John Terry]] for having an extramarital affair, and that on-field racism could be corrected with a handshake, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15782265.stm|title=Sepp Blatter says sorry for racism | work=BBC News | date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew criticism at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup seeding]], when he interrupted a &quot;one-minute silence&quot; for former South-African president [[Nelson Mandela]], who died the day before, after eleven seconds. [[Michael van Praag]], the chairman of the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]], called his behavior &quot;preposterous&quot; and expressed the hope Blatter would not be reelected in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2698/Sport/article/detail/3560318/2013/12/11/Van-Praag-Optredens-Blatter-potsierlijk.dhtml|title=De Volkskrant Van Praag: 'Optredens Blatter potsierlijk' (Dutch)| work=De Volkskrant | date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 election ===
{{Main|51st FIFA Congress}}
Sepp Blatter's 1998 election to the presidency of FIFA over [[UEFA]] President [[Lennart Johansson]] occurred amidst much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Denis |last1=Campbell |first2=Simon |last2=Kuper |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sport/issues/story/0,11839,676076,00.html |title=$1m 'fixed' the FIFA poll, author claims |work=The Observer |date=21 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Jennings |url=http://www.soccernet.com/global/news/2002/0228/20020228featjenningsmain.html |title=Havelange to Blatter, the dynasty based on corruption |publisher=ESPN.com Soccernet |date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatter's 2002 candidacy has been marked with rumours of financial irregularities and backroom dealings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2002/0504/breaking28.htm FIFA president Blatter accused of corruption], The Irish Times citing Reuters, 04–05–02.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with direct accusations of bribery, by a third party, made in the British press by Farra Ado, vice-president of the [[Confederation of African Football]] and president of the [[Somali Football Federation]], who claimed to have been offered $100,000 to vote for Blatter in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/02/28/soccer.blatter/index.html?related |title=Bribery allegation over FIFA poll |publisher=CNN |date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 FIFA World Cup ===
In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], after [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|a controversial second-round match]] between Portugal and the Netherlands, which saw [[referee (association football)|referee]] [[Valentin Ivanov (footballer born 1961)|Valentin Ivanov]] issue a record 16 [[Yellow card (sport)|yellow cards]] and four [[Red card (sports)|red cards]], Blatter was said to have lambasted the officiating referee, and said that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance as a referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5116414.stm |title = Blatter criticizes referee Ivanov | publisher = BBC |date = 26 June 2006|access-date=26 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed to regret his words and promised to officially apologise to Ivanov.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=World-Blatter regrets criticism of referee Ivanov|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-04T114007Z_01_L04777073_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-BLATTER-IVANOV.XML|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707190037/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-04T114007Z_01_L04777073_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-BLATTER-IVANOV.XML|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 July 2006|agency=Reuters|date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sepp Blatter Nov 2013 Zurich.jpg|thumbnail|Blatter at Zurich Train station in November 2013]]

=== Foreign 'over-representation' on club teams ===
Blatter was criticized in 2007 and 2008 for trying to change [[European Union]] employment law regarding the number of foreign players that football clubs could field at any one time. His plans were to set a restriction of five foreign players and having six players from the said team's own nationality. Blatter believed this would help the countries' national sides by having more national players playing in their leagues.

Blatter has often referred to the English [[Premier League]] as one of the major problems in football and used it as an example, due to the influence of foreign players, coaches and owners in the top teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;tele_Fifa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Fifa's Sepp Blatter fears Premier League 'damage' | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 6 March 2009 | access-date = 2 June 2015 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/4945946/Fifas-Sepp-Blatter-fears-Premier-League-damage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/06/fifa-sepp-blatter-premier-league | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Blatter worried Premier League is damaging foreign leagues | date=6 March 2009 | access-date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article5822358.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Sepp Blatter fires broadside at greedy English | first=Paul | last=Rowan | date=1 March 2009 | access-date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spor_Blat&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Blatter Implores Platini To Enforce Tighter Ownership Rules | work = SportsBusiness Daily | date = 7 October 2008 | access-date = 2 June 2015 | url = http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2008/10/Issue-16/Leagues-Governing-Bodies/Blatter-Implores-Platini-To-Enforce-Tighter-Ownership-Rules.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article4895018.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Sepp Blatter gets tough on foreign owners of Premier League clubs | date=7 October 2008 | access-date=23 May 2010 | first1=Kevin | last1=Eason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Cup's chosen sites ===
[[File:Barack Obama and Sepp Blatter in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|Blatter with [[Barack Obama]] and [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]]. In the vote for the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups]], U.S. President Obama said that FIFA made &quot;the wrong decision&quot; in awarding Qatar the tournament in 2022.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9250612.stm|title=Russia &amp; Qatar will host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups|date=2 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was reported that Blatter had &quot;cut an unofficial deal with UEFA head [[Michel Platini]]&quot; to ensure Europe would receive the 2018 World Cup, such that if the non-European bids did not withdraw from 2018 &quot;they will find themselves frozen out and not given any backing by the FIFA High Command, damaging their chances of being serious contenders for the second tournament.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mirr_Boos&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Boost for England's 2018 World Cup bid as FIFA want European host | work = Mirror Online (UK) | date = 19 February 2010 | access-date = 2 June 2015 | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/boost-englands-2018-world-cup-3362214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering 13 nations. Mexico and Indonesia withdrew. Five of the remaining nine bids—South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and the United States—were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others were bidding for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-12-03-2489687100_x.htm |title=Bid teams focus on 2018, 2022 WCup hosting prize |first=Graham |last=Dunbar |work=[[USA Today]] |date=3 December 2009 |access-date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted either of the two preceding tournaments are not eligible to host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/administration/releases/newsid=625122.html#rotation+ends+2018 |title=Rotation ends in 2018 |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |access-date=10 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101002817/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/administration/releases/newsid%3D625122.html |archive-date= 1 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the bids of England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium and Spain/Portugal were forced to be for 2018 only.

The criticism attracted by Blatter's refusal to allow [[goal-line technology]] or [[Instant replay|video replays]] intensified following the controversial [[Frank Lampard]] disallowed goal in the match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] on 27 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen Gibson in Bloemfontein |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/28/world-cup-2010-goal-line-technology-fifa |title=World Cup 2010: Stubborn Fifa rules out using goal-line technology at guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |date= 28 June 2010|access-date=20 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Blatter stated that he deplored the &quot;evident referee mistakes&quot; in the England v Germany and Mexico v Argentina matches, and apologised to the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]] and the [[Mexican Football Federation]] (the two organizations directly concerned by the referees' mistakes), acknowledging that Lampard had indeed scored against Germany and that Tévez's goal against Mexico had been scored from an offside position.

He added: &quot;It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. […] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees. […] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8771294.stm &quot;World Cup 2010: Blatter sorry for disallowed goal&quot;], BBC, 29 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/29/world-cup-2010-sepp-blatter-technology &quot;World Cup 2010: Sepp Blatter says sorry to England for disallowed goal&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 29 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 FIFA presidential election ===
{{Main|61st FIFA Congress}}
[[File:Luis Suarez - CA2011 mvp award.jpg|thumb|Blatter (right) with [[Luis Suárez]], the Player of the Tournament of the [[2011 Copa América]].]]
In 2011, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fourth consecutive term. The [[ChangeFIFA]] organisation, on 29 March 2011, endorsed former [[Chile national football team|Chilean]] defender and for three years running [[South American Footballer of the Year]] [[Elías Figueroa]] as candidate for the presidency, urging national federations to nominate him,&lt;ref name=world&gt;[http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=34235 &quot;ChangeFIFA Urges Federations to Back South American Legend's Challenge to Blatter Presidency&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008141006/http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=34235 |date= 8 October 2011 }} ''World Football Insider'', 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but, subsequently, Figueroa decided not to accept the nomination, stating that &quot;in such a short period of time&quot; he could not develop a case &quot;worthy of the magnitude and importance of such a distinguished job&quot;&lt;ref name=world /&gt;

The vote took place at the [[61st FIFA Congress]] in Zurich.&lt;ref name=&quot;hammam-ends&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=29 May 2011

Blatter criticised the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), stating FIFA manage their finances &quot;like a housewife&quot;, after the IOC announced it would look into allegations of corruption against [[Issa Hayatou]], president of the Confederation of African Football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New gaffe from FIFA's Blatter|url=http://asia.eurosport.com/olympicgames/olympic-games/2012/new-gaffe-from-blatter_sto2609564/story.shtml|publisher=Eurosport|access-date=10 January 2011|date=10 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710205416/http://asia.eurosport.com/olympicgames/olympic-games/2012/new-gaffe-from-blatter_sto2609564/story.shtml|archive-date=10 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There being no other nominations, Blatter ran unopposed in the ensuing presidential election and was re-elected for a fourth term, with 186 of the 203 votes cast. In his campaign, Blatter had stipulated that, if re-elected in 2011, he would not run again for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/925031/sepp-blatter-re-elected-as-fifa-president?cc=5739|title=Blatter re-elected as FIFA president|date=1 June 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet|access-date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8549452/Fifa-congress-and-presidential-election-live.html|title=Fifa congress and presidential election: live|date=1 June 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 June 2011|location=London|first=Paul|last=Kelso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatter received criticism for not postponing his 2011 election in which his term as FIFA President was extended through 2015, despite the fact that all other candidates for the role had been suspended or withdrew.

=== Allegations of financial mismanagement ===
Amidst internal divisions, FIFA's secretary-general Blatter's deputy and former protégé Michel Zen-Ruffinen drew up a 30-page dossier outlining allegations of financial mismanagement within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1967384.stm |title=Blatter could face corruption probe |work=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238575,00.html |title=Last Man Standing |first=Jack |last=Mikrut |work=Time |date=19 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dossier alleged that the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner ISL had led to losses of up to $100m under Blatter's management.

The allegations were backed by Johansson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1974333.stm |title=Fifa sues Blatter |work=BBC Sport |date=8 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dossier was handed to the Swiss authorities, but they cleared Blatter of any wrongdoing and FIFA had to pay all the costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/social_affairs/detail/Blatter_cleared_of_corruption.html?siteSect=201&amp;sid=1495711&amp;cKey=1039003200000 Blatter cleared of corruption], swissinfo.org, 4 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An internal investigation within FIFA was halted by Blatter because members of it broke confidentiality agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1926839.stm |title=Blatter suspends FIFA investigation |work=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This questionable behaviour led him to remove Zen-Ruffinen from office immediately before the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

In April 2012 the Council of Europe published a report which stated it would be &quot;difficult to imagine&quot; that Blatter would have been unaware of &quot;significant sums&quot; paid to unnamed FIFA officials by ISSM/ISL in connection with lucrative contracts for World Cup television rights and the subsequent bankruptcy and collapse of ISL in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/23/fifa-sepp-blatter-isl-bribery-case?newsfeed=true |title=Council of Europe criticises Sepp Blatter's handling of ISL bribery case| agency=Press Association| work=The Guardian| date=23 April 2012| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe report will be considered by over 300 parliamentarians from the 47 Council of Europe member states in Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/football/football-blatter-corruption-report/index.html| title=Council of Europe report criticizes Blatter in ISL corruption case| author=Paul Gittings| publisher=CNN| date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awarding of 2018 and 2022 World Cup ===

Controversy came in the British press when Russia was awarded the 2018 event, with England receiving just two of their &quot;promised&quot; votes; this controversy was dismissed by Blatter as the English showing themselves to be &quot;bad losers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9269849.stm|title=Sepp Blatter calls England bid team 'bad losers'|date=8 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awarding of the 2022 games to Qatar was also controversial. The illegality of homosexuality in the nation caused Blatter to joke that &quot;I would say they [gay fans] should refrain from any sexual activities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9284186.stm|title=Fifa boss Sepp Blatter sparks Qatar gay controversy|date=14 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought criticism from retired basketball player [[John Amaechi]] and [[gay rights]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9284186.stm ''Fifa boss Sepp Blatter sparks Qatar gay controversy''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 FIFA Ethics Committee investigation ===
On 29 April 2013, FIFA's Ethics Committee concluded its investigation into allegations of illegal payments to FIFA officials from the organisation's former marketing partner [[International Sports and Leisure]] (ISL), which went bankrupt in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/30/sport/football/blatter-fifa-havelange-bribery-football/index.html?hpt=hp_t3 &quot;FIFA 'bribe' officials escape punishment&quot;], CNN, 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and published its report.&lt;ref name=eckert&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/footballgovernance/02/06/60/80/islreporteckert29.04.13e.pdf  Statement of the Chairman of the FIFA Adjudicatory Chamber, Hans-Joachim Eckert, on the examination of the ISL case], FIFA, 29 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA president Sepp Blatter was cleared of any misconduct, but his predecessor, Brazilian [[João Havelange]], resigned as FIFA's honorary president&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/30/joao-havelange-resigns-fifa &quot;João Havelange resigns as Fifa honorary president over 'bribes'&quot;]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; over his part in the scandal, since Havelange along with former FIFA Executive Committee members [[Ricardo Teixeira]] and Dr. [[Nicolás Leoz]] were found to have accepted illegal payments between 1992 and May 2000. A week before FIFA's ethics committee announced its findings, 84-year-old Leoz had resigned from his post as president of the [[South American Football Confederation]], citing &quot;health reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/30/uk-soccer-conmebol-idUKBRE93T16920130430 &quot;Figueredo officially succeeds Leoz as FIFA ethics probe revealed&quot;], [[Reuters]], 30 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Blatter, in a statement, &quot;note[d] with satisfaction&quot; that the report &quot;confirms that 'President Blatter's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules'.&quot; He added he has &quot;no doubt that FIFA, thanks to the governance reform process that [Blatter] proposed now has the mechanisms and means to ensure that such an issue does not happen again&quot;, though admitting that the scandal &quot;has caused untold damage to the reputation of [FIFA].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=2066106/index.html &quot;Reaction from Joseph S.

===2015 FIFA presidential election, controversy and resignation ===
{{Further|2015 FIFA corruption case}}

In 2015, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fifth consecutive term. [[Prince Ali bin Hussein]] was his opponent in the election.

The vote took place at the [[65th FIFA Congress]] in Zürich on 29 May 2015. Neither party received the necessary two-thirds majority of votes from the first round with Blatter receiving 133 to Prince Ali's 73. According to FIFA rules, a second round should have been held for the two candidates, with a simple majority being sufficient for victory. However, before the second round of voting commenced, Prince Ali announced his withdrawal, handing Blatter victory by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/fifa-world-cup/story/2471359/sepp-blatter-named-fifa-president-after-prince-ali-concedes|title=Sepp Blatter beats Prince Ali to be named FIFA president for 5th term|publisher=ESPN|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2015, FIFA abruptly called a press conference at their Zürich headquarters, where Blatter announced that he would resign from the post of FIFA president amid the [[2015 FIFA corruption case|ongoing corruption scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/02/fifa-calls-press-conference-amid-latest-corruption-claims-live|title=Sepp Blatter to resign as Fifa president – as it happened|date=3 June 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32982449|title=Sepp Blatter to resign as Fifa president amid corruption scandal|date=3 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the news conference he said: &quot;My mandate does not appear to be supported by everybody&quot; and announced an extraordinary congress scheduled &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to elect his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32982449|title=Fifa: Sepp Blatter to quit as president amid corruption scandal|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatter announced that he would remain in office until his successor could be elected at the extraordinary congress, likely to be held some time between December 2015 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-to-resign-as-fifa-president.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0 |title=Sepp Blatter Decides to Resign as FIFA President in About-Face |work=The New York Times |date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued with words: &quot;While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football—the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe, and love football as much as we all do at FIFA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnn.com/2015/06/02/football/fifa-sepp-blatter-presidency-successor-election/index.html|title=Sepp Blatter stepping down, says FIFA needs 'profound overhaul'|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, on 26 June Blatter prompted speculation that he might be preparing to renege on this resignation, when he was quoted as saying that &quot;I have not resigned, I put my mandate in the hands of an extraordinary congress&quot;. This seemed to contradict his comments from 2 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/26/sepp-blatter-i-did-not-resign-museum-waxwork?CMP=twt_gu|title=Sepp Blatter: 'I did not resign … I'm not ready for the museum or a waxwork'|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was further quoted as saying that he resigned &quot;to take away the pressure from FIFA and my employees, including [pressure] from the sponsors&quot;. Reports speculated that it appears that Blatter will step down at the &quot;extraordinary congress&quot; though the situation remains vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2015/06/27/sepp-blatter-will-step-down-confirms-there-was-sponsor-pressure-for-him-to-leave/|title=Sepp Blatter will step down, confirms there was sponsor pressure for him to leave|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September, Swiss investigators announced that they were investigating Blatter in relation to payments made to UEFA president Michel Platini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34363289|title=Fifa: Sepp Blatter faces Swiss criminal investigation|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Blatter and Platini denied any impropriety around the payments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/28/sepp-blatter-fifa-returns-to-work-michel-platini|title=Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini deny wrongdoing over £1.35m payment|author=David Conn|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; major FIFA [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Visa Inc.]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Budweiser]] issued public statements requesting that he resign for the good of FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34430729|title=BBC Sport - Sepp Blatter: Coca-Cola among sponsors saying Fifa boss must go|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2015 he was suspended from FIFA for 90 days while investigations into payments made to Michel Platini were conducted. FIFA said in a statement: &quot;The grounds for these decisions are the investigations that are being carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34474231|title=BBC Sport - Sepp Blatter: FIFA suspend Sepp Blatter|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December, FIFA's ethics committee banned both Blatter and Platini from football for eight years.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_dec21&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/21/sepp-blatter-michel-platini-banned-from-football-fifa | title=Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini banned from football for eight years by Fifa | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=21 December 2015 | access-date=21 December 2015 | author=Gibson, Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six.&lt;ref name=BBCSport/&gt; Platini appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which rejected his appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ronay|first=Barney|date=2020-03-05|title=Michel Platini's appeal over ban rejected by European court of human rights|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/05/michel-platini-appeal-over-ban-rejected-by-european-court-of-human-rights-football|access-date=2020-09-13|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual assault allegation==
In November 2017, American goalkeeper [[Hope Solo]] accused Blatter of sexual assault at the [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] awards in 2013. During an interview with the Portuguese newspaper ''Expresso'', Solo stated she &quot;had Sepp Blatter grab my ass&quot; just before the two presented an award together to [[Abby Wambach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conn|first1=David|last2=Marques|first2=Nelson|title=Hope Solo accuses Sepp Blatter of sexual assault at awards ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/10/hope-solo-sepp-blatter-fifa-sexual-assault-accusation|access-date=11 November 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated she &quot;was in shock and completely thrown off.

== Honours ==
{{Main|List of honours received by Sepp Blatter}}
Blatter has been the recipient of numerous awards, medals, honorary degrees, and citizenships from nation states, sport governing bodies, special interest groups, universities, and cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|url=http://www.olympic.org/mr-joseph-s-blatter|title=Mr Joseph S.

His honorary degree from [[De Montfort University]] was revoked by the institution in October 2015, as it had previously been given in recognition of his ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-35158843 Sepp Blatter has been stripped of an honorary degree].

== Personal life ==
Blatter's first wife was Liliane Biner. The couple had a daughter, Corinne,&lt;ref name=Focus28May15&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/vermischtes/sepp-blatter-fifa-pate-sepp-blatter-wie-tickt-der-skandal-praesident_id_4712181.html|title=Fifa-Pate Sepp Blatter: Wie tickt der Skandal-Präsident?|date=28 May 2002|work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]|access-date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced shortly after. In 1981, Blatter married Barbara Käser, the daughter of [[Helmut Käser]], Blatter's predecessor as secretary general of FIFA. Their marriage lasted ten years until Barbara died from complications after an operation. In 1995, Blatter began dating Ilona Boguska, a Polish friend of his daughter Corinne, before they separated in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fifa-scandal-sepp-blatters-track-5832528&lt;/ref&gt;

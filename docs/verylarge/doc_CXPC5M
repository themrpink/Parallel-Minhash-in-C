The most common arguments for opposition are:
* The Israeli government asserts that the Arab refugee problem is largely caused by the refusal of all Arab governments except Jordan to grant citizenship to Palestinian Arabs who reside within those countries' borders. This has produced much of the poverty and economic problems of the refugees, according to MFA documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/11/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20About%20Israel#refugee &quot;Frequently Asked Questions About Israel;&quot; &quot;Who is Responsible for the Palestinian refugee problem?&quot;] ''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''.  1 November 2001.  16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Palestinian refugee issue is handled by a separate authority from that handling other refugees, that is, by [[UNRWA]] and not the [[UNHCR]]. Most of the people recognizing themselves as Palestinian refugees would have otherwise been assimilated into their country of current residency, and would not maintain their refugee state if not for the separate entities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Concerning the origin of the Palestinian refugees, the official version of the Israeli government is that during the 1948 War the [[Arab Higher Committee]] and the Arab states encouraged Palestinians to flee in order to make it easier to rout the Jewish state or that they did so to escape the fights by fear.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa faq&quot; /&gt; The Palestinian narrative is that refugees were expelled and dispossessed by Jewish militias and by the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]], following a plan established even before the war.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Historians still debate the [[causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus]].
* Since none of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|900,000 Jewish refugees who fled anti-Semitic violence in the Arab world]] was ever compensated or repatriated by their former countries of residence—to no objection on the part of Arab leaders—a precedent has been set whereby it is the responsibility of the nation which accepts the refugees to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wais.stanford.edu/Israel/israel_andthepalestinerightofreturn51603.html &quot;Israel and the Palestine right of return.&quot;] World Association of International Studies. 8 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alwaya, Semha.

* Historian [[Benny Morris]] states that most of Palestine's 700,000 refugees fled because of the &quot;flail of war&quot; and expected to return home shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as happened in Haifa. In his scholarly work, however, he does conclude that there were expulsions which were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Benny|title=Righteous victims : a history of the Zionist-Arab conflict, 1881–2001|date=2001|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-74475-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/252 252–258]|edition=1st Vintage Books|url=https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Israel and the Palestinians&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2008/0221/1203471491836.html |title=Israel and the Palestinians |work=The Irish Times |date=2 February 2008 |access-date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated by the Arabs themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Israel and the Palestinians&quot;/&gt; In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military leadership.

* According to Karsh the Palestinians were themselves the aggressors in the 1948–1949 war who attempted to &quot;cleanse&quot; a neighboring ethnic community. Had the United Nations resolution of 29 November 1947 recommending partition in Palestine not been subverted by force by the Arab world, there would have been no refugee problem in the first place. He reports of large numbers of Palestinian refugees leaving even before the outbreak of the 1948 war because of disillusionment and economic privation. The British High Commissioner for Palestine spoke of the &quot;collapsing Arab morale in Palestine&quot; that he partially attributed to the &quot;increasing tendency of those who should be leading them to leave the country&quot; and the considerable evacuations of the Arab effendi class. Huge numbers of Palestinians were also expelled by their leadership to prevent them from becoming Israeli citizens and in Haifa and Tiberias, tens of thousands of Arabs were forcibly evacuated on the instructions of the Arab Higher Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karsh |first=Efraim |date=1 May 2001 |title=The Palestinians and the 'Right of Return' |work=Commentary |volume=111 |issue=5 |page=25 |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-palestinians-and-the-right-of-return/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country's security concerns. Options have included military action (including [[targeted killing]]s and [[House demolition in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|house demolitions]] of terrorist operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and [[West Bank Barrier|security barriers]].

Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As early as the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1930s revolts in Palestine]], Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]], [[As-Sa'iqa|Palestinian baathists]] broke from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and allied with the Shia [[Amal Movement]], [[War of the Camps|fighting a bloody civil war]] that killed thousands of Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Syria: A Country Study, [[Federal Research Division]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiloaḥ le-ḥeḳer ha-Mizraḥ ha-tikhon ṿe-Afriḳah, Mekhon.

Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Intifada]], more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] to crack down on suspected [[Shin Bet|Israeli security service]] informers and collaborators. The [[Palestinian Authority]] was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the [[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]], less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Catherine. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0522/p01s04-wome.html/(page)/2 &quot;How Israel builds its fifth column.&quot;] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.  22 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policies towards suspected collaborators contravene agreements signed by the Palestinian leadership. Article XVI(2) of the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo II Agreement]] states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/THE+ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN+INTERIM+AGREEMENT.htm &quot;THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT.&quot;] ''Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs''.  28 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Palestinians who have maintained contact with the Israeli authorities will not be subjected to acts of harassment, violence, retribution, or prosecution.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The provision was designed to prevent Palestinian leaders from imposing retribution on fellow Palestinians who had worked on behalf of Israel during the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

In the [[Gaza Strip]], Hamas officials have tortured and killed thousands of [[Fatah]] members and other Palestinians who oppose their rule. During the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]], more than 150 Palestinians died over a four-day period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5698:pchr-publishes-black-days-in-the-absence-of-justice-report-on-bloody-fighting-in-the-gaza-strip-from-7-to-14-june-2007&amp;catid=72:press-releases-security-chaos-&amp;Itemid=213 &quot;PCHR Publishes 'Black Days in the Absence of Justice: Report on Bloody Fighting in the Gaza Strip from 7 to 14 June 2007.'&quot;] [[Palestinian Center for Human Rights]]. 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The violence among Palestinians was described as a civil war by some commentators.

====International status====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Restricted space in the West Bank, Area C.png|thumb|210px|[[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]], controlled by Israel [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|under Oslo Accords]], in blue and red, in December 2011]]

As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the [[Oslo Accords]], signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration ([[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including [[Oslo II Accord|Oslo II]], [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye River]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum|Sharm el-Sheik]]. According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

The PLO's objective for [[international recognition of the State of Palestine]] is considered by Israel as a provocative &quot;unilateral&quot; act which is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

====Water resources====
{{further|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories|Water politics in the Jordan River basin}}

In the Middle East, [[water resources]] are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground [[aquifer]]s which continue under the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.532703|title=How many Palestinians actually live in the West Bank? |date=30 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=18 October 2014|last1=Hasson |first1=Nir }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/en/surveys/palestin/water.pdf |title=Till the Last Drop: The Palestinian Water Crisis in the West Bank, Hydrogeology and Hydropolitics of a Regional Conflict |access-date=29 November 2008 |author=Messerschmid, Clemens |year=2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217111417/http://www.juragentium.unifi.it/en/surveys/palestin/water.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Oslo II Accord]], both sides agreed to maintain &quot;existing quantities of utilization from the resources.&quot; In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a [[Israeli–Palestinian Joint Water Committee|Joint Water Committee]] (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee.&lt;ref name=Oslo2_Annex3&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/heskemb4_eng.htm ''Annex III: Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs''], Article 40 and SCHEDULE 8. On the Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; Many Palestinians counter that the Oslo II agreement was intended to be a temporary resolution and that it was not intended to remain in effect more than a decade later.

In 1999, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it continued to honor its obligations under the Interim Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/The+Water+Issue+in+the+West+Bank+and+Gaza.htm &quot;The Water Issue in the West Bank and Gaza.&quot;] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.&lt;ref name=bbc20030616&gt;{{cite news|title=Water war leaves Palestinians thirsty|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2982730.stm|work=BBC News|date=16 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report of 2008 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/israel/index.stm |title=Israel |year=2008 |work=Aquastat |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |access-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116204210/http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/israel/index.stm |archivedate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and [[Max Gaylard]], the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: &quot;Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school&quot;. Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Publications&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of sufficient services in Gaza could get worse without urgent action, UN warns|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42751#.UP35DaF4YZc|publisher=UN News Centre|access-date=22 January 2013|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Future and financing=====
Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It is estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn{{clarify|date=October 2010}} is needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heinrich Böll Foundation |title=Water as a human right: The understanding of water in the Arab countries of the Middle East – A four country analysis |year=2004 |url=http://www.emwis.org/countries/fol749974/country045975/countries/PDF/waterbook|access-date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to support and improve the water sector in the Palestinian territories, a number of bilateral and multilateral agencies have been supporting many different water and sanitation programs.

There are three large seawater desalination plants in Israel and two more scheduled to open before 2014. When the fourth plant becomes operational, 65% of Israel's water will come from desalination plants, according to Minister of Finance Dr. Yuval Steinitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/IsraeliEconomy/Economic_News/Desalination_plant_Sorek_23-May-2011.htm|title=One of the biggest desalination plants to be built in Sorek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: &quot;Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Publications&quot;/&gt;

In 1980, Israel annexed East Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=BBC_annexation&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2001/israel_and_palestinians/key_maps/3.stm &quot;Israel &amp; the Palestinians: Key Maps.&quot;] [[BBC News]]. 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has never annexed the West Bank, apart from East Jerusalem, or Gaza Strip, and the United Nations has demanded the &quot;[t]ermination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force&quot; and that Israeli forces withdraw &quot;from territories occupied in the recent conflict&quot; – the meaning and intent of the latter phrase is disputed. See [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242#Interpretations|Interpretations]].

It has been the position of Israel that the most Arab-populated parts of West Bank (without major Jewish settlements), as well as the entire Gaza Strip, must eventually be part of an independent Palestinian State; however, the precise borders of this state are in question. At [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David]], for example, then-Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] offered Arafat an opportunity to establish a non-militarized Palestinian State. The proposed state would consist of 77% of the West Bank split into two or three areas, followed by: an increase of 86–91% of the West Bank after six to twenty-one years; autonomy, but not sovereignty for some of the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem surrounded by Israeli territory; the entire Gaza Strip; and the dismantling of most settlements.&lt;ref name=Pressman_visions /&gt; Arafat rejected the proposal without providing a counter-offer.

A subsequent settlement proposed by President Clinton offered Palestinian sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank but was similarly rejected with 52 objections.&lt;ref name=&quot;nybooks.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Shimon.

Some Palestinians claim they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eran&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc=Eran, Oded. &quot;Arab-Israel Peacemaking&quot; |pp=121–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute, and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. Other Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, have in the past insisted that Palestinians must control not only the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, but also all of Israel proper. For this reason, Hamas has viewed the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]] &quot;as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelaHamas&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sela|2002|loc=&quot;Hamas&quot;|pp=335–342}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The PLO's agreement to support the participation of a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Madrid Peace Conferences in late October 1991 further fueled the tension between Fatah and Hamas, which embarked on an intensive campaign against the very idea of territorial compromise and peacemaking with the Jews, as religiously forbidden and politically inconceivable&quot; (339).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, a proposal put forward by Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]], was enacted. All residents of Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip were evacuated, and all residential buildings were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Historic+Events/Disengagement+-+August+2005.htm &quot;Disengagement – August 2005.&quot;] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 15 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various mediators and various proposed agreements have shown some degree of openness to Israel retaining some fraction of the settlements which currently exist in the West Bank; this openness is based on a variety of considerations, such as, the desire to find real compromise between Israeli and Palestinian territorial claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton&quot;&gt;

The Israeli government states it is justified under international law to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons.

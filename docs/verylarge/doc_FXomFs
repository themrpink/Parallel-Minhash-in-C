The content of home economics comes from the synthesis of multiple disciplines. This [[interdisciplinary]] knowledge is essential because the phenomena and challenges of everyday life are not typically one-dimensional. The content of home economics courses vary, but may include: [[food]], [[nutrition]], and [[health]]; personal finance; family resource management and planning; [[textile]]s and [[clothing]]; [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] and housing; [[consumerism]] and [[consumer science]]; household management; design and technology; food science and [[hospitality]]; [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and family studies; communication and extension [[education]] and [[community services]], among others. The capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is a strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context.

Home cleaning tasks can be separated into four categories: litter removal, storage of belongings, dusting, and washing of surfaces. Washing of surfaces is the most dangerous and complicated part because of the cleaning solutions. For example, hard water deposits are cleaned with acid solutions and grease is cleaned with alkaline solutions; they can both harm the skin and are reactive toward each other, potentially producing unwanted by-products. Mixing together chlorine bleach and strong acids (e.g. limescale remover containing HCl) forms chlorine gas, which is toxic. Solvents such as [[paint thinner]] and [[rubbing alcohol]] are toxic and flammable. Some disinfectants are toxic. Even dish water can require rubber gloves.

==Professional associations==
The [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences|AAFCS (American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences)]] represents teachers, educators, cooperatives, business, designers and nutritionists. The American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national forum where K-12 teachers, university educators, and corporate executives collaborate to improve the quality of individual and family life.

The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepared youth and adults for successful careers.  ACTE's core purpose is to provide leadership in developing an educated, prepared, and competitive workforce.  The ACTE division of Family and Consumer Sciences Education includes three sections (1) NATFACS - National Association Teachers of Family and Consumer Sciences (2) NATEFACS - National Association Teacher Educators of Family and Consumer Sciences, and (3) NASAFACS - National Association State Administrators of Family and Consumer Sciences.

The [[National Council on Family Relations]], (NCFR) founded in 1938, is the oldest multidisciplinary, nonpartisan professional organization focused solely on family research, practice and education. They claim to be the premier professional association for the multidisciplinary understanding of families. The members’ interests—as diverse as their careers and backgrounds—are focused on topics and efforts that yield a common benefit: …understanding and strengthening families. NCFR members are professionals dedicated to understanding and strengthening families. The 3,400-plus members come from more than 35 countries and all 50 U.S. states, and include: researchers, demographers, marriage and family therapists, parent/family educators, university faculty, students, social workers, public health workers, extension specialists and faculty, ECFE teachers, clergy, counselors, K-12 teachers, and more.

'''Astronomy''' (from {{lang-el|ἀστρονομία}}, literally  meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars) is a [[natural science]] that studies [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[celestial event|phenomena]]. It uses [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] in order to explain their origin and [[chronology of the Universe|evolution]]. Objects of interest include [[planets]], [[natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, [[nebulae]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[comet]]s. Relevant phenomena include [[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[blazar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. [[Cosmology]] is a branch of astronomy. It studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System – Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in [[recorded history]] made methodical observations of the [[night sky]]. These include the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]], [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as [[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the making of [[calendar]]s. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional astronomy is split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.

Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an [[citizen science|active role]]. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of [[transient astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomers]] have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.

===Ancient times===

In early historic times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;Forbes, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the [[geocentric model]] of the Universe, or the [[Ptolemaic system]], named after [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeWitt|first=Richard|title=Worldviews: An Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-1-4051-9563-8|page=113|chapter=The Ptolemaic System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among [[Babylonian astronomy|the Babylonians]], who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity|author=Aaboe, A. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]|volume=276|issue=1257|date=1974|pages=21–42|jstor=74272|doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007|bibcode = 1974RSPTA.276...21A |s2cid=122508567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]] discovered that [[lunar eclipses]] recurred in a repeating cycle known as a [[Saros cycle|saros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |title=Eclipses and the Saros |publisher=NASA |access-date=28 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030225501/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |archive-date=30 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AiKhanoumSunDial.jpg|thumb|Greek equatorial [[sundial]], [[Alexandria on the Oxus]], present-day Afghanistan 3rd–2nd century BC]]

Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] world. [[Greek astronomy]] is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| date = 2009| contribution = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| title = Brill's New Pauly| title-link = Brill's New Pauly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|size and distance of the Moon and Sun]], and he proposed a model of the [[Solar System]] where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aristarchus's On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and the Moon: Greek and Arabic Texts | journal = Archive for History of Exact Sciences | date = May 2007 | first1 = J.L. | last1 = Berrgren |first2= Nathan |last2= Sidoli | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 213–54 | doi = 10.1007/s00407-006-0118-4| s2cid = 121872685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century BC, [[Hipparchus]] discovered [[precession]], calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hipparchus.html|title=Hipparchus of Rhodes|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, [[University of St Andrews]], Scotland|access-date=28 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023062202/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hipparchus.html|archive-date=23 October 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the [[constellation]]s of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurston|first=H.|title=Early Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNpHjqxQQ9oC&amp;pg=PA2|year=1996|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-94822-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antikythera mechanism]] (c. 150–80 BC) was an early [[analog computer]] designed to calculate the location of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] for a given date.

===Middle Ages===

Medieval Europe housed a number of important astronomers. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336) made major contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first astronomical clock, the [[Rectangulus]] which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an [[equatorium]] called the ''Albion'' which could be used for astronomical calculations such as [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planet]]ary [[longitude]]s and could predict [[eclipse]]s. [[Nicole Oresme]] (1320–1382) and [[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus (predecessor of the modern scientific theory of [[inertia]]) which was able to show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.&lt;ref&gt;Hannam, James. ''God's philosophers: how the medieval world laid the foundations of modern science''. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg von Peuerbach]] (1423–1461) and [[Regiomontanus]] (1436–1476) helped make astronomical progress instrumental to Copernicus's development of the heliocentric model decades later.

[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world]] and other parts of the world.

For over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Heilbron, ''The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories'' (1999) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific revolution===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo]]'s sketches and observations of the [[Moon]] revealed that the surface was mountainous.]]
[[File:Medieval Astronomy (f.4v).jpg|thumb|An astronomical chart from an early scientific manuscript, c. 1000]]
During the [[Renaissance]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by [[Galileo Galilei]] and expanded upon by [[Johannes Kepler]]. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 49–58&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Isaac Newton]], with his invention of [[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]], who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f58-64&quot;&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 58–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] catalogued over 3000 stars,&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1864) ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]''&lt;/ref&gt; More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet [[Uranus]], the first new planet found.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18–19th centuries, the study of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 1909, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]] and [[Astrophotography|photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;short history&quot; /&gt;

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of &quot;external&quot; galaxies. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name=Belkora2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Belkora, Leila|title=Minding the heavens: the story of our discovery of the Milky Way|isbn=978-0-7503-0730-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qBM-wez94WwC|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|date=2003|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the 20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the [[Big Bang]] theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], [[Hubble's law]], and the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|cosmological abundances of elements]]. [[Space telescope]]s have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In February 2016, it was revealed that the [[LIGO]] project had [[first observation of gravitational waves|detected evidence]] of [[gravitational waves]] in the previous September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News| url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=11 February 2016 |last1=Castelvecchi |first1=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361 |s2cid=182916902|access-date=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Abbot'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger| authors=B.P.

==Observational astronomy==
{{Main|Observational astronomy}}

The main source of information about [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] and other objects is [[visible light]], or more generally [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum|publisher=NASA|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905131651/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html|archive-date=5 September 2006 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.

===Radio astronomy===
[[File:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|thumb|The [[Very Large Array]] in [[New Mexico]], an example of a [[radio telescope]]]]
{{Main|Radio astronomy}}
Radio astronomy uses radiation with [[wavelength]]s greater than approximately one millimeter, outside the visible range.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-387-98746-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed [[radio wave]]s can be treated as [[wave]]s rather than as discrete [[photon]]s. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

Although some [[radio wave]]s are emitted directly by astronomical objects, a product of [[black-body radiation|thermal emission]], most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of [[synchrotron radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s orbit [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]], notably the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21&amp;nbsp;cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;shu1982&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

A wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including [[supernova]]e, interstellar gas, [[pulsar]]s, and [[active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shu1982&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Infrared astronomy}}
Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of [[infrared]] radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, [[circumstellar disk]]s or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their host [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/|title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission|date=30 September 2014|publisher=[[NASA]] [[University of California, Berkeley]]|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112144939/http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/|archive-date=12 January 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma2013&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 2013Ap&amp;SS.344..175M|title = Discovering protostars and their host clusters via WISE|last1 = Majaess|first1 = D.|journal = Astrophysics and Space Science|volume = 344|issue = 1|pages = 175–186|year = 2013|arxiv = 1211.4032|doi = 10.1007/s10509-012-1308-y|s2cid = 118455708}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the exception of infrared [[wavelengths]] close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Main|Optical astronomy}}
Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|author=Moore, P.

|isbn=978-0-540-07465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 [[Ångstrom|Å]] to 7000 Å (400 [[nanometre|nm]] to 700&amp;nbsp;nm),&lt;ref name=&quot;moore1997&quot;/&gt; that same equipment can be used to observe some [[near-ultraviolet]] and [[near-infrared]] radiation.

===Ultraviolet astronomy===
{{Main|Ultraviolet astronomy}}

Ultraviolet astronomy employs [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200&amp;nbsp;Å (10 to 320&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[OB star]]s) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e, [[supernova remnant]]s, and active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

===X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|X-ray astronomy}}
[[File:B30727.jpg|thumb|X-ray jet made from a supermassive black hole found by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, made visible by light from the early Universe]]
X-ray astronomy uses [[X-radiation|X-ray wavelengths]]. Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by [[synchrotron emission]] (the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), [[bremsstrahlung radiation|thermal emission from thin gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;million) [[kelvin]]s, and [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission from thick gases]] above 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Kelvin.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; Since X-rays are absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], all X-ray observations must be performed from [[high-altitude balloon]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s. Notable [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray sources]] include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

===Gamma-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Gamma ray astronomy}}
Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;spectrum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|title=The electromagnetic spectrum|last=Penston|first=Margaret J.|date=14 August 2002|publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908014227/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/frontiers/latest/feature.asp?article=14F1&amp;style=feature|archive-date=8 September 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Gamma ray|gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]] candidates such as active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt;

===Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum===
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth.

In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use heavily shielded [[Neutrino observatory|underground facilities]] such as [[SAGE (ruSsian American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka II/III]] for the detection of [[neutrino]]s. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the [[Sun]], but 24 neutrinos were also detected from [[supernova 1987A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cox2000&quot;/&gt; [[Cosmic ray]]s, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

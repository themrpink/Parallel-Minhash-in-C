On June 19, 1879, Sherman delivered an address to the graduating class of the [[Michigan Military Academy]], in which he may have uttered the famous phrase &quot;War is Hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro and Joseph Epstein, eds., ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 708.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 11, 1880, he addressed a crowd of more than 10,000 in Columbus, Ohio: &quot;There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From transcript published in the ''Ohio State Journal'', August 12, 1880, reproduced in Lewis, p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945, [[Harry S. Truman|President Harry S. Truman]] would say: &quot;Sherman was wrong.  I'm telling you I find peace is hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Kirkendall, ed., ''Harry's Farewell: Interpreting and Teaching the Truman Presidency'' (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1980), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sherman's significant contributions as head of the Army was the establishment of the Command School (now the [[Command and General Staff College]]) at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in 1881. Sherman stepped down as commanding general on November 1, 1883, and retired from the army on February 8, 1884.

==Later years==
He lived most of the rest of his life in New York City. He was devoted to the theater and to amateur painting and was much in demand as a colorful speaker at dinners and banquets, in which he indulged a fondness for quoting [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Woodward&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he stayed in contact with war veterans, and through them accepted honorary membership into the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity and the [[The Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)|Irving Literary Society]].  Sherman was proposed as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[1884 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1884]], but declined as emphatically as possible, saying, &quot;I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marszalek in ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War'', p. 1769.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a categorical rejection of a candidacy is now referred to as a &quot;[[Shermanesque statement]]&quot;. On June 7, 1865 he delivered the commencement speech at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dame|first=Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|title=Gen. William T. Sherman at Notre Dame // Notre Dame 175 // University of Notre Dame|url=https://175.nd.edu/175-moments/gen-william-t-sherman-at-notre-dame/|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Notre Dame 175|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 he joined the newly formed [[Boone and Crockett Club]], a wildlife conservation organization founded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Archives|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140406011637/http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1|archivedate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Shermandeathmask.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sherman's [[death mask]]]]
Sherman died of pneumonia in New York City at 1:50 PM on February 14, 1891, six days after his 71st birthday. President [[Benjamin Harrison]] sent a telegram to General Sherman's family and ordered all national flags to be flown at half mast. Harrison, in a message to the Senate and the House of Representatives, wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt; He was an ideal soldier, and shared to the fullest the esprit du corps of the army, but he cherished the civil institutions organized under the Constitution, and was only a soldier that these might be perpetuated in undiminished usefulness and honor.&lt;ref&gt;BENJAMIN HARRISON.  &quot;SORROW AT THE CAPITAL :FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT – EULOGIES IN THE SENATE.. &quot; New York Times (1857–1922)  February 15, 1891, ProQuest Historical Newspapers New York Times (1851–2008) w/ Index (1851–1993), ProQuest. Web.  March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 19, a funeral service was held at his home, followed by a military procession.  General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], the Confederate officer who had commanded the resistance to Sherman's troops in Georgia and the Carolinas, served as a [[pallbearer]] in New York City. It was a bitterly cold day and a friend of Johnston, fearing that the general might become ill, asked him to put on his hat. Johnston replied: &quot;If I were in [Sherman's] place, and he were standing in mine, he would not put on his hat.&quot; Johnston did catch a serious cold and died one month later of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Lewis, p. 652; Marszalek, pp. 495–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Sherman's body was then transported to St. Louis, where another service was conducted on February 21, 1891 at a local Catholic church. His son, [[Thomas Ewing Sherman]], a Jesuit priest, presided over his father's funeral mass.  Sherman is buried in [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] in St. Louis.

==Religious views==
Sherman's birth family was Presbyterian and he was originally baptized as such.  His foster family, including his future wife Ellen, were devout Catholics, and Sherman was re-baptized and later married in the Catholic rite.  According to his son Thomas, who became a Catholic priest, Sherman attended the Catholic Church until the outbreak of the Civil War, but not thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Hirshson, pp. 387–88. At the time of Sherman's death, his son Thomas, a Jesuit, reportedly said: &quot;My father was baptized in the Catholic Church, married in the Catholic Church, and attended the Catholic Church until the outbreak of the civil war. Since that time he has not been a communicant of any church.&quot; See Thomas C. Fletcher, ''Life and Reminiscences of General Wm. T. Sherman by Distinguished Men of His Time'' (Baltimore: R.H. Woodward Co., 1891), 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, Sherman wrote publicly that &quot;my immediate family are strongly Catholic. I am ''not'' and cannot be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Hon. James G. Blaine,&quot; ''North American Review'' 147, no. 385 (Dec. 1888): 616, 624.&lt;/ref&gt; A memoirist reports that Sherman told him in 1887 that &quot;my family is strongly Roman Catholic, but I am not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward W. Bok, ''The Americanization of Edward Bok'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1920), 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman wrote his wife Ellen Ewing in 1842 that &quot;I believe in good works rather than faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Sherman to Ellen Ewing, April 7, 1842, in Howe, Home Letters, 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
In the years immediately after the war, Sherman's conservative politics was attractive to white Southerners. By the 1880s, however, Southern &quot;[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]&quot; writers began to demonize Sherman for his attacks on civilians in the &quot;March&quot;.  The magazine ''[[Confederate Veteran]]'', based in Nashville, gave Sherman more attention than anyone else, in part to enhance the visibility of the western theater. His devastation of railroads and plantations mattered less than the March's insult to southern dignity, especially its unprotected womanhood.  Moody criticizes English historians Field Marshal Viscount Garnet Wolseley, Maj. Gen. John F. C. Fuller, and especially Capt. Basil H. Liddell Hart, who built up Sherman's reputation by exaggerating his &quot;atrocities&quot; and filtering his actions through their ideas about modern warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley Moody, ''Demon of the Lost Cause: Sherman and Civil War History'' (University of Missouri Press; 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast Sherman was a popular hero in the North and well regarded by his soldiers. Military historians have paid special attention to his Atlanta campaign and the March to the Sea, generally giving him high marks as an innovative strategist and quick-witted tactician.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Caudill and Paul Ashdown, ''Sherman's March in Myth and Memory'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiography and memoirs===
[[File:Sherman's March to the Sea - Project Gutenberg eText 21566.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sheet music for &quot;Sherman's March to the Sea&quot;]]
Around 1868, Sherman began to write a &quot;private&quot; recollection for his children about his life before the Civil War, identified now as his unpublished &quot;Autobiography, 1828–1861&quot;. This manuscript is held by the [[Ohio Historical Society]]. Much of the material in it would eventually be incorporated in revised form in his memoirs.

In 1875, ten years after the end of the Civil War, Sherman became one of the first Civil War generals to publish a memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Marszalek, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Memoirs of General William T. Sherman.  By Himself'', published by [[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton &amp; Co.]], in two volumes, began with the year 1846 (when the Mexican War began) and ended with a chapter about the &quot;military lessons of the [civil] war&quot;. The memoirs were controversial, and sparked complaints from many quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Marszalek, p. 463. In 1875, Henry V. Boynton published a critical [https://archive.org/details/shermanshistori00boyngoog &lt;!-- quote=boyton &quot;sherman's historical raid&quot;. --&gt; book-length review] of Sherman's memoirs &quot;based upon compilations from the records of the war office&quot;. This led to the publication of [https://archive.org/details/reviewgeneralsh00moulgoog/page/n5 &lt;!-- pg=1 quote=Moulton sherman memoirs. --&gt; a defense of Sherman] by C.W. Moulton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant (serving as president when Sherman's memoirs first appeared) later remarked that others had told him that Sherman treated Grant unfairly but &quot;when I finished the book, I found I approved every word; that ... it was a true book, an honorable book, creditable to Sherman, just to his companions—to myself particularly so—just such a book as I expected Sherman would write.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from John Russell Young, ''Around the World with General Grant'', vol. II, 290–91, quoted in Sherman, ''Memoirs'' (Library of America ed., 1990), p. 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, after the publication of Grant's memoirs, Sherman produced a &quot;second edition, revised and corrected&quot; of his memoirs with Appleton.  The new edition added a second preface, a chapter about his life up to 1846, a chapter concerning the post-war period (ending with his 1884 retirement from the army), several appendices, portraits, improved maps, and an index. For the most part, Sherman refused to revise his original text on the ground that &quot;I disclaim the character of historian, but assume to be a witness on the stand before the great tribunal of history&quot; and &quot;any witness who may disagree with me should publish his own version of [the] facts in the truthful narration of which he is interested&quot;.  However, Sherman did add the appendices, in which he published the views of some others.&lt;ref&gt;1886 Preface. In one amusing change to his text, Sherman dropped the assertion that [[John Sutter]], of gold-rush fame, had become &quot;very 'tight'&quot; at a Fourth of July celebration in 1848 and stated instead that Sutter &quot;was enthusiastic&quot;. Sherman, ''Memoirs'' (Library of America ed., 1990), Note on the Text, p. 1123; H.W. Brands, ''The Age of Gold'' (Doubleday, 2002), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sherman Profile.png|thumb|left|150px|upright|Sherman in his later years, in civilian evening clothes]]

Subsequently, Sherman shifted to the publishing house of Charles L. Webster &amp; Co., the publisher of Grant's memoirs. The new publishing house brought out a &quot;third edition, revised and corrected&quot; in 1890. This difficult-to-find edition was substantively identical to the second (except for the probable omission of Sherman's short 1875 and 1886 prefaces).&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, ''Memoirs'' (Library of America ed., 1990), Note on the Text, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sherman died in 1891, there were dueling new editions of his memoirs. His first publisher, Appleton, reissued the original (1875) edition with two new chapters about Sherman's later years added by the journalist [[Willis Fletcher Johnson|W. Fletcher Johnson]]. Meanwhile, Charles L. Webster &amp; Co. issued a &quot;fourth edition, revised, corrected, and complete&quot; with the text of Sherman's second edition, a new chapter prepared under the auspices of the Sherman family bringing the general's life from his retirement to his death and funeral, and an appreciation by politician [[James G. Blaine]] (who was related to Sherman's wife). Unfortunately, this edition omits Sherman's prefaces to the 1875 and 1886 editions.

In 1904 and 1913, Sherman's youngest son (Philemon Tecumseh Sherman) republished the memoirs, with Appleton (not Charles L. Webster &amp; Co.). This was designated as a &quot;second edition, revised and corrected&quot;. This edition contains Sherman's two prefaces, his 1886 text, and the materials added in the 1891 Blaine edition. Thus, this virtually invisible edition of Sherman's memoirs is actually the most comprehensive version.

There are many modern editions of Sherman's memoirs. The edition most useful for research purposes is the 1990 Library of America version, edited by Charles Royster. It contains the entire text of Sherman's 1886 edition, together with annotations, a note on the text, and a detailed chronology of Sherman's life. Missing from this edition is the useful biographical material contained in the 1891 Johnson and Blaine editions.

===Published correspondence===
Many of Sherman's official war-time letters (and other items) appear in the ''Official Records of the War of the Rebellion''.  Some of these letters are rather personal in nature, rather than relating directly to operational activities of the army.  There also are at least five published collections of Sherman correspondence:
* ''Sherman's Civil War: Selected Correspondence of William T. Sherman, 1860–1865'', edited by Brooks D. Simpson and Jean V. Berlin (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999) – a large collection of war-time letters (November 1860 to May 1865).
* ''Sherman at War'', edited by Joseph H. Ewing (Dayton, OH: Morningside, 1992) – approximately thirty war time letters to Sherman's father-in-law, Thomas Ewing, and one of his brothers-in-law, Philemon B. Ewing.
* [https://archive.org/details/homelettersgene02shergoog &lt;!-- quote=home letters sherman howe. --&gt; ''Home Letters of General Sherman,''] edited by M.A. DeWolfe Howe (New York: Charles Scribner's Son, 1909) – edited letters to his wife, Ellen Ewing Sherman, from 1837 to 1888.
* [https://archive.org/details/shermanlettersc01shergoog ''The Sherman Letters: Correspondence Between General Sherman and Senator Sherman from 1837 to 1891,''] edited by Rachel Sherman Thorndike (New York: Charles Scribner's Son, 1894) – edited letters to his brother, Senator John Sherman, from 1837 to 1891.
* [https://archive.org/details/generalwtsherma00shergoog ''General W.T. Sherman as College President,''] edited by Walter L. Fleming (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark Co., 1912) – edited letters and other documents from Sherman's 1859–1861 service as superintendent of the Louisiana Seminary of Learning and Military Academy.

===In popular culture===
The presentation of Sherman in popular culture is now discussed at book-length in ''Sherman's March in Myth and Memory'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2008), by Edward Caudill and Paul Ashdown. Some of the artistic treatments of Sherman's march are the Civil War era song &quot;[[Marching Through Georgia]]&quot; by [[Henry Clay Work]]; [[Herman Melville]]'s poem &quot;The March to the Sea&quot;; [[Ross McElwee]]'s film ''[[Sherman's March (1986 film)|Sherman's March]]''; and [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s novel ''[[The March (novel)|The March]]''.

===Sherman on U.S. postage===
Sherman is one of the few generals to have appeared on several different US postage stamp issues.  The first stamp issue to honor him was released on March 21, 1893, a little more than two years after his death. The engraving was modeled after a [[:File:William-t-sherman photo vy Sarnoy.jpg|photograph]] taken by [[Napoleon Sarony]] in 1888.  The Post Office released a second and third Sherman issue of 1895, both almost identical to the first issue, with slight changes in the framework design and color. Sherman appeared again in the [[:File:Army Navy 1937 issue10.jpg|US Army issue of 1937]], a commemorative postage stamp jointly honoring Generals Sherman, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and [[Philip H. Sheridan|Sheridan]]. The last stamp issue to honor Sherman was released in 1995 and was a 32-cent stamp. With five different issues to his name, Sherman has featured more prominently in US postage than most US presidents.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's US Stamp Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherman name in the military===
* Sherman lent his name to the [[Sherman tank]]. Formally named the Medium Tank, M4, it acquired the name &quot;Sherman&quot; from the British Army, who received M4 tanks under the Lend-Lease Act. The combined name &quot;M4 Sherman&quot; or just &quot;Sherman&quot; spread to American personnel and it has since become common to refer to it by that name.
* USS ''[[USS General Sherman (1864)|General Sherman]]'', a Civil War gunboat acquired by the US Navy from the US Army in 1864, was named for Sherman. After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the gunboat was struck from the naval register and sent back to the Army.
* [[Fort Sherman]], a U.S. Army base located at Toro Point, Panama, was named after Sherman. The base was vacated by the US Army and turned over to Panama in 1999.

'''Edward VII''' (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841&amp;nbsp;– 6 May 1910) was [[King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Emperor of India]] from 22 January 1901 until his death in 1910.

The eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was [[Prince of Wales]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne for almost 60 years. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.

As king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Edward VII (1841_–_1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]
Edward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|author-link=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. He was christened ''Albert Edward'' at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 25 January 1842.{{efn|His godparents were [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|the King of Prussia]], his paternal step-grandmother [[Duchess Marie of Württemberg|the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (for whom [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]], his maternal grandmother, stood proxy), his great-uncle [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|the Duke of Cambridge]], his step-great-grandmother [[Princess Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel|the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]], his great-aunt, stood proxy), his great-aunt [[Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Sophia]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge]], his first cousin once-removed, stood proxy) and his great-uncle [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20065|date=28 January 1842|page=224}})&lt;/ref&gt;}} He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]. He was known as ''Bertie'' to the royal family throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bentley-Cranch|first=Dana|title=Edward VII: Image of an Era 1841–1910|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|year=1992|isbn=978-0-11-290508-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the eldest son of the British sovereign, he was automatically [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of [[Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Ernestine duchies|Duke of Saxony]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] on 8 December 1841, [[Earl of Dublin]] on 17 January 1850,&lt;ref name=&quot;weir&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cp&quot; /&gt;{{efn|Gazetted on 10 September 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21018|pages=2783|date=11 September 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} a [[Knight of the Garter]] on 9 November 1858, and a [[Knight of the Thistle]] on 24 May 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;weir&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|author-link=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised Edition|publisher=Random House|location=London|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7126-7448-5|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in favour of his younger brother [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste|Van der Kiste, John]] (September 2004; online edition May 2007) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/346 &quot;Alfred, Prince, duke of Edinburgh (1844–1900)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/346}}, retrieved 24 June 2009 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen and Prince Albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model [[constitutional monarch]]. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], he did not excel in his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ridley|first=Jane|year=2012|title=Bertie: A Life of Edward VII|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|isbn=978-0-7011-7614-3|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—[[Benjamin Disraeli]] described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, [[Robert Bruce (1813–1862)|Robert Bruce]].

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, Edward spent the summer of that year studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]] under, among others, the chemist [[Lyon Playfair]]. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot;&gt;[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H. C. G.]] (September 2004; online edition May 2006) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32975 &quot;Edward VII (1841–1910)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32975}}, retrieved 24 June 2009 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, he transferred to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLS861AE|name=Wales, H.R.H.

==Early adulthood==
[[File:H.R.H. Prince of Wales and Suite at Point View, Niagara.jpg|thumb|Edward at [[Niagara Falls]], 1860]]
In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident ''[[wikt:en:bonhomie|bonhomie]]'' made the tour a great success.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc&quot;&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 20–34&lt;/ref&gt; He inaugurated the [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal]], across the [[St Lawrence River]], and laid the cornerstone of [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]. He watched [[Charles Blondin]] traverse [[Niagara Falls]] by highwire, and stayed for three days with President [[James Buchanan]] at the [[White House]]. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to [[Mount Vernon]], to pay his respects at the tomb of [[George Washington]]. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] Prayers for the royal family were said in [[Trinity Church, New York]], for the first time since 1776.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc&quot; /&gt; The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, pp. 39–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward had hoped to pursue a career in the [[British Army]], but his mother vetoed an active military career.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22198|page=4745|date=9 November 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], the eldest daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|Prince Christian of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. The Queen and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Prussia]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt;

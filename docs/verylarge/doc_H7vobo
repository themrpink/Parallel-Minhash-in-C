On 1 January 1942, MacArthur accepted $500,000 from President Quezon of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff.{{sfn|Rogers|1990|p=165}}{{sfn|Petillo|1979|pp=107–117}} Eisenhower—after being appointed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force]] (AEF)—was also offered money by Quezon, but declined.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=372}} These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L.

====Escape from the Philippines====
{{main|Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines}}
In February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to relocate to Australia.{{sfn|James|1975|p=98}} On the night of 12 March 1942, MacArthur and a select group that included his wife Jean, son Arthur, Arthur's [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] ''[[Amah (occupation)|amah]]'', Ah Cheu, and other members of his staff, including Sutherland, Richard Marshall and Huff, left Corregidor. They traveled in [[Patrol torpedo boat|PT boats]] through stormy seas patrolled by Japanese warships, and reached [[Del Monte Airfield]] on [[Mindanao]], where B-17s picked them up, and flew them to Australia. MacArthur ultimately arrived in [[Melbourne]] by train on 21 March.{{sfn|Morton|1953|pp=359–360}}{{sfn|Rogers|1990|pp=190–192}} His famous speech, in which he said, &quot;I came through and I shall return&quot;, was first made on [[Terowie railway station]] in [[South Australia]], on 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48749454 |title='I Came Through; I Shall Return'. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=21 March 1942 |accessdate=22 July 2012 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to &quot;We shall return&quot;. He ignored the request.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 2 December 1991&quot; /&gt;

Bataan surrendered on 9 April,{{sfn|Morton|1953|pp=463–467}} and Corregidor on 6 May.{{sfn|Morton|1953|p=561}}

====Medal of Honor====
[[File:Douglas MacArthur MOH Plaque, USMA.JPG|thumb|upright|A plaque inscribed with MacArthur's Medal of Honor citation lies affixed to MacArthur barracks at the U.S. Military Academy |alt=A bronze plaque with an image of the Medal of Honor, inscribed with MacArthur's Medal of Honor citation. It reads: &quot;For conspicuous leadership in preparing the Philippine Islands to resist conquest, for gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against invading Japanese forces, and for the heroic conduct of defensive and offensive operations on the Bataan Peninsula. He mobilized, trained, and led an army which has received world acclaim for its gallant defense against a tremendous superiority of enemy forces in men and arms. His utter disregard of personal danger under heavy fire and aerial bombardment, his calm judgment in each crisis, inspired his troops, galvanized the spirit of resistance of the Filipino people, and confirmed the faith of the American people in their Armed Forces.&quot;]]

George Marshall decided that MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated, &quot;to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command&quot;.{{sfn|James|1975|p=129}}  Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to [[Charles Lindbergh]] as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen [[J. Parnell Thomas]] and [[James E. Van Zandt]], Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department, expressing that the recognition &quot;would mean more&quot; if the gallantry criteria were not waived by a bill of relief.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=129–130}}{{sfn|Mears|2018|pp=144–145}}

Marshall ordered Sutherland to recommend the award, and authored the citation himself. Ironically, this also meant that it violated the governing statute, as it could only be considered lawful so long as material requirements were waived by Congress, such as the unmet requirement to perform conspicuous gallantry &quot;above and beyond the call of duty.&quot; Marshall admitted the defect to the Secretary of War, acknowledging that &quot;there is no specific act of General MacArthur's to justify the award of the Medal of Honor under a literal interpretation of the statutes.&quot; Similarly, when the Army's Adjutant General reviewed the case in 1945, he determined that &quot;authority for [MacArthur's] award is questionable under strict interpretation of regulations.&quot;{{sfn|Mears|2018|pp=144–145}}

MacArthur had been nominated for the award twice before and understood that it was for leadership and not gallantry. He expressed the sentiment that &quot;this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command&quot;.{{sfn|James|1975|p=132}} Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001, when Theodore Roosevelt was posthumously awarded for his service during the [[Spanish–American War]], [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]] having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;arlingtoncemetery&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 16 January 2001&quot; /&gt; MacArthur's citation, written by Marshall,{{sfn|James|1975|p=131}} read:{{quote|For conspicuous leadership in preparing the Philippine Islands to resist conquest, for gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against invading Japanese forces, and for the heroic conduct of defensive and offensive operations on the Bataan Peninsula. He mobilized, trained, and led an army which has received world acclaim for its gallant defense against a tremendous superiority of enemy forces in men and arms.

As the symbol of the forces resisting the Japanese, MacArthur received many other accolades. The Native American tribes of the Southwest chose him as a &quot;Chief of Chiefs&quot;, which he acknowledged as from &quot;my oldest friends, the companions of my boyhood days on the Western frontier&quot;.{{sfn|Manchester|1978|p=290}} He was touched when he was named Father of the Year for 1942, and wrote to the National Father's Day Committee that:{{quote|By profession I am a soldier and take pride in that fact, but I am prouder, infinitely prouder to be a father. A soldier destroys in order to build; the father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentialities of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son when I am gone will remember me, not from battle, but in the home, repeating with him our simple daily prayer, &quot;Our father, Who art in Heaven.&quot;{{sfn|Manchester|1978|p=290}}}}

===New Guinea Campaign===
{{further|New Guinea Campaign}}

====General Headquarters====
On 18 April 1942, MacArthur was appointed [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA). Lieutenant General [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]] became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and Vice Admiral [[Herbert F. Leary]] became Commander, Allied Naval Forces.{{sfn|Gailey|2004|pp=7–14}} Since the bulk of land forces in the theater were Australian, George Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=18–23}}

MacArthur established a close relationship with the Prime Minister of Australia, [[John Curtin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB MacArthur&quot; /&gt; and was probably the second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister,{{r|ADB Forde}} although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them.{{sfn|Rogers|1990|p=253}} MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces,{{sfn|Gailey|2004|pp=7–14}}{{sfn|Rogers|1990|pp=275–278}}{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=417–418}} and in August 1942 selected Major General [[George C. Kenney]] to replace him.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=197–198}}{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=26}} Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=488}}

[[File:curtinmacarthur.jpg|thumb|left|Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] (right) confers with MacArthur|alt=Two men seated at a table side by side talking. One is wearing a suit, the other a military uniform.]]
The staff of MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the &quot;Bataan Gang&quot;.{{sfn|James|1975|p=80}} Though Roosevelt and George Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=18–23}} Initially located in Melbourne,{{sfn|Rogers|1990|p=202}} GHQ moved to [[Brisbane]]—the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities—in July 1942,{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=48}} occupying the Australian Mutual Provident Society building (renamed after the war as [[MacArthur Chambers]]).{{sfn|Rogers|1990|pp=285–287}}

MacArthur formed his own [[signals intelligence]] organization, known as the [[Central Bureau]], from Australian intelligence units and American [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] who had escaped from the Philippines.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=18–19}} This unit forwarded [[Ultra]] information to MacArthur's Chief of Intelligence, [[Charles A. Willoughby]], for analysis.{{sfn|Drea|1992|p=26}} After a press release revealed details of the Japanese naval dispositions during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], at which a Japanese attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] was turned back,{{sfn|James|1975|pp=165–166}} Roosevelt ordered that censorship be imposed in Australia, and the [[Advisory War Council (Australia)|Advisory War Council]] granted GHQ censorship authority over the Australian press. Australian newspapers were restricted to what was reported in the daily GHQ communiqué.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=165–166}}{{sfn|Rogers|1990|p=265}} Veteran correspondents considered the communiqués, which MacArthur drafted personally, &quot;a total farce&quot; and &quot;Alice-in-Wonderland information handed out at high level&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 15 January 1951&quot; /&gt;

====Papuan Campaign====
Anticipating that the Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at [[Merauke]] and [[Milne Bay]] to cover its flanks.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=39–41}} The [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for an attack on the Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operation]]. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo|seizure of the Tulagi area]], would be conducted by the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]], under Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]]. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=46–48}}

The Japanese struck first, [[Invasion of Buna-Gona|landing at Buna]] in July,{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=53–55}} and at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] in August. The Australians repulsed the Japanese at Milne Bay,{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=77–88}} but a series of defeats in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]] had a depressing effect back in Australia. On 30 August, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, [[New Guinea Force]] would be overwhelmed. He sent Blamey to Port Moresby to take personal command.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} Having committed all available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American forces. The [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]], a poorly trained National Guard division, was selected.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=91–92}} A series of embarrassing reverses in the [[Battle of Buna–Gona]] led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by the Australians. MacArthur then ordered Lieutenant General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]] to assume command of the Americans, and &quot;take Buna, or not come back alive&quot;.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=371–372}}{{sfn|Luvaas|1972|pp=32–33}}

MacArthur moved the advanced echelon of GHQ to Port Moresby on 6 November 1942.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=235}} After Buna finally fell on 3 January 1943,{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=321}} MacArthur awarded the Distinguished Service Cross to twelve officers for &quot;precise execution of operations&quot;. This use of the country's second highest award aroused resentment, because while some, like Eichelberger and [[George Alan Vasey]], had fought in the field, others, like Sutherland and Willoughby, had not.{{sfn|James|1975|p=275}} For his part, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal,{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=167}} and the Australian government had him appointed an honorary [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the British Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM MacArthur&quot; /&gt;

====New Guinea Campaign====
At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] approved MacArthur's plan for [[Operation Cartwheel]], the advance on Rabaul.{{sfn|Hayes|1982|pp=312–334}} MacArthur explained his strategy:
{{quote|My strategic conception for the Pacific Theater, which I outlined after the Papuan Campaign and have since consistently advocated, contemplates massive strokes against only main strategic objectives, utilizing surprise and air-ground striking power supported and assisted by the fleet. This is the very opposite of what is termed &quot;island hopping&quot; which is the gradual pushing back of the enemy by direct frontal pressure with the consequent heavy casualties which will certainly be involved. Key points must of course be taken but a wise choice of such will obviate the need for storming the mass of islands now in enemy possession. &quot;Island hopping&quot; with extravagant losses and slow progress&amp;nbsp;... is not my idea of how to end the war as soon and as cheaply as possible. New conditions require for solution and new weapons require for maximum application new and imaginative methods. Wars are never won in the past.{{sfn|Willoughby|1966|p=100}}}}

One is standing, holding a long stick and pointing to the location of Japan on a wall map of the Pacific.]]
In [[New Guinea]], a country without roads, large-scale transportation of men and materiel would have to be accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled [[landing craft]] were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns.{{sfn|Casey|1959|pp=31–33}} The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the [[Amphibious warfare ship|landing ships]] of the [[VII Amphibious Force]], which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed [[Seventh Fleet]].{{sfn|Morison|1950|pp=130–132}} Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the [[Fifth Air Force]].{{sfn|James|1975|p=220}}

Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]]'s [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur had only three American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Battle of Buna–Gona and [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. As a result, &quot;it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army&quot;.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|p=12}} The offensive began with the [[landing at Lae]] by the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] on 4 September 1943. The next day, MacArthur watched the [[landing at Nadzab]] by [[Airborne forces|paratroops]] of the [[503rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|503rd Parachute Infantry]]. His B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but he insisted that it fly on to Nadzab.{{sfn|James|1975|p=327}} For this, he was awarded the [[Air Medal]].{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=179}}

The [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th]] and 9th Divisions converged on Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th to capture [[Battle of Kaiapit|Kaiapit]] and [[Finisterre Range campaign|Dumpu]], while the 9th mounted an [[Huon Peninsula campaign|amphibious assault on Finschhafen]]. Here, the offensive bogged down, partly because MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=328–329}}

In early November, MacArthur's plan for a westward advance along the coast of New Guinea to the Philippines was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=364–365}}{{sfn|Hayes|1982|pp=487–490}} Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the [[Admiralty Islands]]. Although Willoughby did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing there, commencing the [[Admiralty Islands campaign]]. He accompanied the assault force aboard the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|2}}, the flagship of Vice Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], the new commander of the Seventh Fleet, and came ashore seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, for which he was awarded the [[Bronze Star]].{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=189}} It took six weeks of fierce fighting before the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] captured the islands.{{sfn|Willoughby|1966|pp=137–141}}

MacArthur had one of the most powerful PR machines of any Allied general during the war, which made him into an extremely popular war hero with the American people.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=654}} In late 1943–early 1944, there was a serious effort by the conservative faction in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] centered in the Midwest to have MacArthur seek the Republican nomination to be the candidate for the presidency in the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]], as they regarded the two men most likely to win the Republican nomination, namely [[Wendell Willkie]] and Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York, as too liberal.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=654}} For a time, MacArthur, who had long seen himself as a potential president, was in the words of the U.S historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] &quot;very interested&quot; in running as the Republican candidate in 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=654}} However, MacArthur's vow to &quot;return&quot; to the Philippines had not been fulfilled in early 1944 and he decided not to run for president until he had liberated the Philippines.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=655}}

Furthermore, Weinberg had argued that it is probable that Roosevelt, who knew of the &quot;enormous gratuity&quot; MacArthur had accepted from Quezon in 1942, had used his knowledge of this transaction to blackmail MacArthur into not running for president.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=1084}} Finally, despite the best efforts of the conservative Republicans to put MacArthur's name on the ballot, on 4 April 1944, Governor Dewey won such a convincing victory in the Wisconsin primary (regarded as a significant victory given that the Midwest was a stronghold of the conservative Republicans opposed to Dewey) as to ensure that he would win the Republican nomination to be the GOP's candidate for president in 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=655}}

MacArthur now bypassed the Japanese forces at [[Hansa Bay]] and [[Wewak]], and assaulted [[Landing at Hollandia|Hollandia]] and [[Landing at Aitape|Aitape]], which Willoughby reported to be lightly defended based on intelligence gathered in the [[Battle of Sio]]. MacArthur's bold thrust by going 600 miles up the coast had surprised and confused the Japanese high command, who had not anticipated that MacArthur would take such risks.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=653}} Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the [[Ramu|Ramu Valley]], the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of Nimitz's [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to provide air support.{{sfn|Willoughby|1966|pp=142–143}} Though risky, the operation turned out to be another success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]]'s [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Japanese XVIII Army]] in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. While bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the strategic drawback of tying up Allied troops to contain them. Moreover, Adachi was far from beaten, which he demonstrated in the [[Battle of Driniumor River]].{{sfn|Taaffe|1998|pp=100–103}}

===Philippines Campaign (1944–45)===
{{further|Philippines Campaign (1944–45)}}

====Leyte====
In July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in Hawaii &quot;to determine the phase of action against Japan&quot;. Nimitz made the case for attacking Formosa. MacArthur stressed America's moral obligation to liberate the Philippines and won Roosevelt's support. In September, Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.]]'s carriers made a series of air strikes on the Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey concluded, incorrectly, that [[Leyte]] was &quot;wide open&quot; and possibly undefended, and recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=152–159}}

On 20 October 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army [[Battle of Leyte|landed on Leyte]], while MacArthur watched from the light cruiser {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|6}}. That afternoon he arrived off the beach. The advance had not progressed far; snipers were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. When his whaleboat grounded in knee-deep water, MacArthur requested a landing craft, but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request. MacArthur was compelled to wade ashore.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=552–556}} In his prepared speech, he said:{{quote|People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on Philippine soil—soil consecrated in the blood of our two peoples. We have come dedicated and committed to the task of destroying every vestige of enemy control over your daily lives, and of restoring upon a foundation of indestructible strength, the liberties of your people.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=216}}}}

There are palm trees in the distance and landing craft offshore. A small group in the center conspicuously wear khaki uniforms and peaked caps instead of jungle green uniforms and helmets.]]
Since Leyte was out of range of Kenney's land-based aircraft, MacArthur was dependent on carrier aircraft.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=228}} Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on [[Tacloban]], where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on ''Nashville''{{'}}s bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=561–562}} Over the next few days, the Japanese counterattacked in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], resulting in a near-disaster that MacArthur attributed to the command being divided between himself and Nimitz.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|pp=222–231}} Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. Heavy monsoonal rains disrupted the airbase construction program. Carrier aircraft proved to be no substitute for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese to pour troops into Leyte. Adverse weather and tough Japanese resistance slowed the American advance, resulting in a protracted campaign.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|pp=231–234}}{{sfn|James|1975|pp=568–569}}

By the end of December, Krueger's headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on 26 December MacArthur issued a communiqué announcing that &quot;the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up&quot;. Yet [[Robert L. Eichelberger|Eichelberger]]'s [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] killed another 27,000 Japanese on Leyte before the campaign ended in May 1945.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=602–603}} On 18 December 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new [[five-star rank]] of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], placing him in the company of Marshall and followed by Eisenhower and [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold]], the only four men to achieve the rank in World War II. Including [[Omar Bradley]] who was promoted during the Korean War as to not be outranked by MacArthur, they were the only five men to achieve the title of General of the Army since 5 August 1888 death of [[Philip Sheridan]]. MacArthur was senior to all but Marshall.&lt;ref name=&quot;history.army.mil 5star&quot; /&gt; The rank was created by an [[Act of Congress]] when [[Act of Congress|Public Law]] [[s:Public Law 78-482|78–482]] was passed on 14 December 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;PL78-482&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_78-482 | title= Public Law 482 | accessdate= 29 April 2008}} This law allowed only 75% of pay and allowances to the grade for those on the retired list.&lt;/ref&gt; as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war. The temporary rank was then declared permanent 23 March 1946 by Public Law 333 of the [[79th Congress]], which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-6.htm |title=Public Law 333, 79th Congress |date=11 April 2007 |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] |accessdate=22 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212055/http://history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-6.htm |archive-date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 79-333|url=http://legisworks.org/congress/79/publaw-333.pdf|website=legisworks.org|publisher=Legis Works|accessdate=19 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121013632/http://legisworks.org/congress/79/publaw-333.pdf|archive-date=21 November 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Luzon====
MacArthur's next move was the [[Battle of Mindoro|invasion of Mindoro]], where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the [[Sulu Sea]], and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on ''Nashville''. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a ''[[kamikaze]]'' struck ''Nashville'', killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by ''kamikazes''.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=604–609}} During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not be taken to the Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.{{sfn|Murray|Millet|2001|p=495}}

Sutherland, President [[Sergio Osmeña]], General Douglas MacArthur|alt=Eight men in khaki uniforms, seated.]]
The way was now clear for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]]. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby estimated the strength of General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s forces on Luzon at 137,000, while Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. MacArthur's response was &quot;Bunk!&quot;.{{sfn|Drea|1992|p=186}} He felt that even Willoughby's estimate was too high. &quot;Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur's attributes&quot;,{{sfn|Drea|1992|p=187}} and he disregarded the estimates. In fact, they were too low; Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=180–187}} This time, MacArthur traveled aboard the light cruiser {{USS|Boise|CL-47|6}}, watching as the ship was nearly hit by a bomb and torpedoes fired by [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=619–620}} His communiqué read: &quot;The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest Pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops.&quot;{{sfn|James|1975|p=622}}

MacArthur's primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were required to support future operations. He urged his commanders on.{{sfn|James|1975|p=629}} On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to [[Hacienda Luisita]], closer to the front than Krueger's.{{sfn|James|1975|p=623}} He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February,{{sfn|James|1975|pp=632–633}} but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] had decided to defend Manila to the death. The [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]] raged for the next three weeks.{{sfn|Drea|1992|pp=195–200}} To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes,{{sfn|Rogers|1991|p=261}} but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=642–644}} He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies.{{sfn|James|1975|p=654}} For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=244}}

After taking Manila, MacArthur installed one of his Filipino friends, [[Manuel Roxas]]—who also happened to be one of the few people who knew about the huge sum of money Quezon had given MacArthur in 1942—into a position of power that ensured Roxas was to become the next Filipino president.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=863}} Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of José Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=863}} About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that &quot;evidence to this effect has yet to surface&quot;, and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort to address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=863–864}}

After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur turned his attention to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon.{{sfn|Murray|Millet|2001|pp=500–501}} Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended.{{sfn|Murray|Millet|2001|p=502}} On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.{{sfn|Murray|Millet|2001|p=502}}

Two men in uniform stand behind him. A large crowd of men in uniform look on.]]
Although MacArthur had no specific directive to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed his forces to liberate the remainder of the Philippines.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=737–741}} In the GHQ communiqué on 5 July, he announced that the Philippines had been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon.{{sfn|James|1975|p=749}} Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invasion of Borneo]]. He accompanied the [[Battle of North Borneo|assault on Labuan]], and visited the troops ashore. While returning to GHQ in Manila, he visited [[Davao City|Davao]], where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number surrendered.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=757–761}} In July 1945, he was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=260}}

As part of preparations for [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the [[Twentieth Air Force]]. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=725–726, 765–771}} During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the decision-makers in Washington that it was essential to have the Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial to have the Red Army tie down the Kwantung army in Manchuria.{{sfn|Weinberg|2004|p=872}} The invasion was pre-empted by the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|formal Japanese surrender]] aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, thus ending hostilities in World War II.{{sfn|James|1975|pp=786–792}} In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=265}}

===Protecting the Emperor===
On 29 August 1945, MacArthur was ordered to exercise authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]].{{sfn|James|1975|pp=782–783}} MacArthur's headquarters was located in the [[DN Tower 21|Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building]] in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=541}} Unlike Germany, there was a certain partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and most of the rest of the Japanese elite.{{sfn|Bix|2000|pp=544–545}} The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=545}}

[[File:Macarthur hirohito.jpg|thumb|upright|left|MacArthur and the [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Hirohito]], at their first meeting, September 1945 |alt=A tall Caucasian male (MacArthur), without hat and wearing open-necked shirt and trousers, standing beside a much shorter Asian man (Hirohito) in a dark suit.]]
MacArthur took the view that a few &quot;militarist&quot; extremists had &quot;hijacked&quot; Japan starting in 1931 with the [[Mukden Incident]], the Emperor was a pro-Western &quot;moderate&quot; who had been powerless to stop the militarists, and thus bore no responsibility for any of the war crimes committed by the Japanese between 1931 and 1945.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=545}} The American historian [[Herbert P. Bix]] described the relationship between the general and the Emperor as: &quot;the Allied commander would use the Emperor, and the Emperor would cooperate in being used. Their relationship became one of expediency and mutual protection, of more political benefit to Hirohito than to MacArthur because Hirohito had more to lose–the entire panoply of symbolic, legitimizing properties of the imperial throne&quot;.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=549}}

At the same time, MacArthur undermined the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous picture of his first meeting with the Emperor, the impact of which on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur on the grounds that it damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.{{sfn|Bix|2000|pp=550–551}}

As he needed the Emperor, MacArthur protected him from any effort to hold accountable for his actions, and allowed him to issue statements that incorrectly portrayed the emerging democratic post-war era as a continuation of the Meiji era reforms.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=562}} MacArthur did not allow any investigations of the Emperor, and instead in October 1945 ordered his staff &quot;in the interests of peaceful occupation and rehabilitation of Japan, prevention of revolution and communism, all facts surrounding the execution of the declaration of war and subsequent position of the Emperor which tend to show fraud, menace or duress be marshalled&quot;.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=567}} In January 1946, MacArthur reported to Washington that the Emperor could not be indicted for war crimes on the grounds: {{quote|His indictment will unquestionably cause a tremendous convulsion among the Japanese people, the repercussions of which cannot be overestimated. He is a symbol which unites all Japanese. Destroy him and the nation will disintegrate...It is quite possible that a million troops would be required which would have to be maintained for an indefinite number of years.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=568}}}}

To protect the Emperor from being indicted, MacArthur had one of his staff, Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]] tell the ''genrō'' Admiral [[Mitsumasa Yonai]] on 6 March 1946:{{quote|To counter this situation, it would be most convenient if the Japanese side could prove to us that the Emperor is completely blameless. I think the forthcoming trials offer the best opportunity to do that. Tojo, in particular should be made to bear all responsibility at his trial. I want you to have Tojo say as follows: &quot;At the imperial conference prior to the start of the war, I already decided to push for war even if his majesty the emperor was against going to war with the United States.&quot;{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=584}}}}

From the viewpoint of both sides, having one especially evil figure in the form of General [[Hideki Tojo]], on whom everything that went wrong could be blamed, was most politically convenient.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=584}} At a second meeting on 22 March 1946, Fellers told Yonai: {{quote|The most influential advocate of un-American thought in the United States is [[Benjamin Victor Cohen|Cohen]] (a Jew and a Communist), the top adviser to Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes|Byrnes]]. As I told Yonai... it is extremely disadvantageous to MacArthur's standing in the United States to put on trial the very Emperor who is cooperating with him and facilitating the smooth administration of the occupation. This is the reason for my request... &quot;I wonder whether what I said to Admiral Yonai the other day has already been conveyed to Tojo?&quot;.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=585}}&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin V. Cohen, then one of the top advisors to Secretary of State Byrnes, was demanding that the Emperor be tried as a war criminal.{{harvnb|Neary|2014|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

MacArthur's attempts to shield the Emperor from indictment and to have all the blame taken by Tojo were successful, which as [[Herbert P. Bix]] commented, &quot;had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on the Japanese understanding of the lost war&quot;.{{sfn|Bix|2000|p=585}}

===War crimes trials===
[[File:IMTFE defendants.jpg|thumb|right|The defendants at the Tokyo War Crimes Trials|alt=Three rows of benches with a dozen or so men standing behind each. Behind them stand five men in uniform.]]
MacArthur was responsible for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]].{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|pp=318–319}} In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the [[Rape of Nanking]], the [[Bataan Death March]] and [[Manila massacre]].{{sfn|Drea|Bradsher|Hanyok|Lide|2006|p=7}} The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and of which he was probably unaware.{{sfn|Connaughton|Pimlott|Anderson|1995|pp=72–73}} Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.{{sfn|Manchester|1978|p=487}}

MacArthur gave immunity to [[Shiro Ishii]] and other members of [[Unit 731]] in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation.{{sfn|Gold|1996|p=109}} He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including princes such as [[Prince Chichibu|Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka Yasuhiko|Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda Tsuneyoshi|Takeda]], [[Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko|Higashikuni]] and [[Hiroyasu Fushimi|Fushimi]], from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's [[abdication]] would not be necessary.{{sfn|Dower|1999|p=323}} In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.{{sfn|Dower|1999|pp=321–322}}

===Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers===
As [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and his staff helped Japan rebuild itself, eradicate militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=39–139}} In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a [[parliamentary system]] of government, under which the Emperor acted only on the advice of his ministers. It included the famous [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]], which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=119–139}}

A major [[land reform]] was also conducted, led by [[Wolf Ladejinsky]] of MacArthur's SCAP staff. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately {{convert|4700000|acre|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, or 38% of Japan's cultivated land, was purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program, and {{convert|4600000|acre|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} was resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=183–192}} MacArthur's efforts to encourage trade union membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur's reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his unilateral control of Japan was ended by the increased involvement of the State Department.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=174–183}} During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the [[Zaibatsu]], which had previously monopolized industry.{{sfn|Schaller|1985|p=25}} Eventually, looser industrial groupings known as ''[[Keiretsu]]'' evolved. The reforms alarmed many in the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, who believed they conflicted with the prospect of Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.{{sfn|James|1985|pp=222–224, 252–254}}

In 1948, MacArthur made a bid to win the Republican nomination to be the GOP candidate for president, which was the most serious of several efforts he made over the years.{{sfn|Schonberger|1974|p=202}} MacArthur's status as one of America's most popular war heroes together with his reputation as the statesman who had &quot;transformed&quot; Japan gave him a strong basis for running for president, but MacArthur's lack of connections within the GOP were a major handicap.{{sfn|Schonberger|1974|p=203}} MacArthur's strongest supporters came from the quasi-isolationist, Midwestern wing of the Republicans and embraced men such as Brigadier General [[Hanford MacNider]], [[Philip La Follette]], and Brigadier General [[Robert E. Wood]], a diverse collection of &quot;Old Right&quot; and Progressive Republicans only united by a belief that the U.S. was too much involved in Europe for its own good.{{sfn|Schonberger|1974|pp=203–204}} MacArthur declined to campaign for the presidency himself, but he privately encouraged his supporters to put his name on the ballot.{{sfn|Schonberger|1974|p=205}} MacArthur had always stated he would retire when a peace treaty was signed with Japan, and his push in the fall of 1947 to have the U.S sign a peace treaty with Japan was intended to allow him to retire on a high note, and thus campaign for the presidency. For the same reasons, Truman subverted MacArthur's efforts to have peace treaty signed in 1947, saying that more time was needed before the U.S. could formally make peace with Japan.{{sfn|Schonberger|1974|p=207}}

==Alleged kidnap and death threats==
In January 2000, a tip-off to [[Scotland Yard]] detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in [[Hampstead]], London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;kidnap&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Foggo|first1=Daniel|last2=Bamber|first2=David|last3=Lusher|first3=Adam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUX1DTWPDWJEZQFIQMGSFFWAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2002/11/03/nbeck03.xml|title=Five are held in Beckham kidnap plot|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2002|archive-date=9 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309064309/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=GUX1DTWPDWJEZQFIQMGSFFWAVCBQWIV0?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F11%2F03%2Fnbeck03.xml|location=London|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of that year, she received a death threat prior to performing at the [[Brit Awards]] with the Spice Girls, and at the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;kidnap&quot;/&gt; In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/19/newsoftheworld.pressandpublishing |title=PCC clears NoW over Beckham kidnap case |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 September 2003|access-date=11 January 2008 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Cozens}}&lt;/ref&gt; All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;collapses&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2956224.stm |title=Beckham 'kidnap' case collapses |work=BBC News |date= 2 June 2003|access-date=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 documentary ''[[George Michael: A Different Story|A Different Story]]'' covered his career and personal life. Michael's first tour since 1991, the [[25 Live]] tour, spanned three tours over the course of three years; 2006, 2007, and 2008. Four years later, he performed his final concert at London's [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in 2012. In the early hours of 25 December 2016, Michael was found dead at his home in [[Goring-on-Thames|Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire]] aged 53.

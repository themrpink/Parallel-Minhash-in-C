Catherine appointed [[Ivan Betskoy]] as her advisor on educational matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|pp=369–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through him, she collected information from Russia and other countries about educational institutions. She also established a commission composed of T.N. Teplov, T. von Klingstedt, F.G. Dilthey, and the historian G. Muller. She consulted British education pioneers, particularly the Rev. [[Daniel Dumaresq]] and Dr John Brown.&lt;ref&gt;N. Hans, &quot;Dumaresq, Brown and Some Early Educational Projects of Catherine II&quot;, ''Slavonic and East European Review'' (1961) : 229–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1764, she sent for Dumaresq to come to Russia and then appointed him to the educational commission. The commission studied the reform projects previously installed by I.I. Shuvalov under Elizabeth and under Peter III. They submitted recommendations for the establishment of a general system of education for all Russian orthodox subjects from the age of 5 to 18, excluding serfs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no action was taken on any recommendations put forth by the commission due to the calling of the Legislative Commission. In July 1765, Dumaresq wrote to Dr. John Brown about the commission's problems and received a long reply containing very general and sweeping suggestions for education and social reforms in Russia. Dr. Brown argued, in a democratic country, education ought to be under the state's control and based on an education code. He also placed great emphasis on the &quot;proper and effectual education of the female sex&quot;; two years prior, Catherine had commissioned Ivan Betskoy to draw up the General Programme for the Education of Young People of Both Sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Hans, “Dumaresq”, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; This work emphasised the fostering of the creation of a 'new kind of people' raised in isolation from the damaging influence of a backward Russian environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Establishment of the Moscow Foundling Home (Moscow Orphanage) was the first attempt at achieving that goal. It was charged with admitting destitute and extramarital children to educate them in any way the state deemed fit. Because the Moscow Foundling Home was not established as a state-funded institution, it represented an opportunity to experiment with new educational theories. However, the Moscow Foundling Home was unsuccessful, mainly due to extremely high mortality rates, which prevented many of the children from living long enough to develop into the enlightened subjects the state desired.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Evtuhov, ''A History of Russia: Peoples, Legends, Events, Forces'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moscow Orphanage asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|The [[Moscow Orphanage]]]]
[[File:Galaktionov Smolny institute 1823.jpg|thumb|The [[Smolny Institute]], the first Russian [[Institute for Noble Maidens]] and the first European state higher education institution for women]]
Not long after the Moscow Foundling Home, at the instigation of her factotum, Ivan Betskoy, she wrote a manual for the education of young children, drawing from the ideas of [[John Locke]], and founded the famous [[Smolny Institute]] in 1764, first of its kind in Russia. At first, the institute only admitted young girls of the noble elite, but eventually it began to admit girls of the petit-bourgeoisie as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls who attended the Smolny Institute, Smolyanki, were often accused of being ignorant of anything that went on in the world outside the walls of the Smolny buildings, within which they acquired a proficiency in French, music, and dancing, along with a complete awe of the monarch. Central to the institute's philosophy of pedagogy was strict enforcement of discipline. Running and games were forbidden, and the building was kept particularly cold because too much warmth was believed to be harmful to the developing body, as was excessive play.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Max|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1768 to 1774, no progress was made in setting up a national school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Catherine continued to investigate the pedagogical principles and practice of other countries and made many other educational reforms, including an overhaul of the Cadet Corps in 1766. The Corps then began to take children from a very young age and educate them until the age of 21, with a broadened curriculum that included the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. These reforms in the Cadet Corps influenced the curricula of the Naval Cadet Corps and the Engineering and Artillery Schools. Following the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the ''guberniya''—a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor—on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1782, Catherine arranged another advisory commission to review the information she had gathered on the educational systems of many different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; One system that particularly stood out was produced by a mathematician, [[Franz Aepinus]]. He was strongly in favor of the adoption of the Austrian three-tier model of trivial, real, and normal schools at the village, town, and provincial capital levels. 

In addition to the advisory commission, Catherine established a Commission of National Schools under [[Pyotr Zavadovsky]]. This commission was charged with organizing a national school network, as well as providing teacher training and textbooks. On 5 August 1786, the Russian Statute of National Education was created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Madariaga, Foundation, 385&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statute established a two-tier network of high schools and primary schools in ''guberniya'' capitals that were free of charge, open to all of the free classes (not serfs), and co-educational. It also stipulated in detail the subjects to be taught at every age and the method of teaching. In addition to the textbooks translated by the commission, teachers were provided with the &quot;Guide to Teachers&quot;. This work, divided into four parts, dealt with teaching methods, subject matter, teacher conduct, and school administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Madariaga, Foundation, 385&quot; /&gt;

Despite these efforts, later historians of the 19th century were generally critical. Some claimed Catherine failed to supply enough money to support her educational program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after the implementation of Catherine's program, a member of the National Commission inspected the institutions established. Throughout Russia, the inspectors encountered a patchy response. While the nobility provided appreciable amounts of money for these institutions, they preferred to send their own children to private, prestigious institutions. Also, the townspeople tended to turn against the junior schools and their pedagogical{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} methods. Yet by the end of Catherine's reign, an estimated 62,000 pupils were being educated in some 549 state institutions. While a significant improvement, it was only a minuscule number, compared to the size of the Russian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1979|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious affairs ===
[[File:Katharina II., die Große.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Catherine II in the Russian national costume]]

Catherine's apparent embrace of all things Russian (including Orthodoxy) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion. She nationalised all of the church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services. Very few members of the nobility entered the church, which became even less important than it had been. She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;madariaga111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=111–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Catherine promoted Christianity in her anti-Ottoman policy, promoting the protection and fostering of Christians under Turkish rule. She placed strictures on Catholics (''[[Ukase|ukaz]]'' of 23 February 1769), mainly Polish, and attempted to assert and extend state control over them in the wake of the partitions of Poland.&lt;ref name=newadvent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13253a.htm|title=The Religion of Russia|accessdate=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Catherine's Russia provided an asylum and a base for regrouping to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] following the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuits]] in most of Europe in 1773.&lt;ref name=newadvent /&gt;

==== Islam ====
{{Seealso|Islam in Russia}}
[[File:Башкирские казаки в Европе.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] riders from the Ural steppes]]
Catherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign.  She avoided force and tried persuasion (and money) to integrate Moslem areas into her empire.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Fisher, &quot;Enlightened despotism and Islam under Catherine II.&quot; ''Slavic Review'' 27.4 (1968): 542-553 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2494437 online]. &lt;/ref&gt; Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs. They were pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives. Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy.  However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith. This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so. Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure.  Catherine chose to assimilate Islam into the state rather than eliminate it when public outcry became too disruptive. After the &quot;Toleration of All Faiths&quot; Edict of 1773, Muslims were permitted to build mosques and practise all of their traditions, the most obvious of these being the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which previously had been denied.  Catherine created the [[Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly]] to help regulate Muslim-populated regions as well as regulate the instruction and ideals of mullahs. The positions on the Assembly were appointed and paid for by Catherine and her government as a way of regulating religious affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, 1968 pp 546–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russian Empire 1792 Map.jpg|thumb|280px|Russian Empire in 1792]]
In 1785, Catherine approved the subsidising of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was another attempt to organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the nomadic people who wandered through southern Russia. In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system under government regulation. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people to settle. This allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen under the jurisdiction of Russian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=508–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, 1968 pp 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judaism ====
{{Seealso|Judaism in Russia}}
Russia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system. Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a Jew is because the term meant many things during her reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism was a small, if not non-existent, religion in Russia until 1772. When Catherine agreed to the [[First Partition of Poland]], the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion. Catherine separated the Jews from Orthodox society, restricting them to the [[Pale of Settlement]]. She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|pp=506–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours. Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madariaga|1981|pp=504–08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to assimilate the Jews into Russia's economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Russians disliked the inclusion of Judaism, mainly for economic reasons. Catherine tried to keep the Jews away from certain economic spheres, even under the guise of equality; in 1790, she banned Jewish citizens from Moscow's middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, Catherine declared Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klier|1976|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; This re-established the separate identity that Judaism maintained in Russia throughout the Jewish [[Haskalah]]. Catherine's decree also denied Jews the rights of an Orthodox or naturalised citizen of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews bore no relation to Russians.

==== Russian Orthodoxy ====
[[File:Kingsobor.jpg|thumb|left|upright|St. Catherine Cathedral in [[Kingisepp]], an example of Late Baroque architecture]]
In many ways, the Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine. Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started: The church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the [[College of Economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Raeff, Mark. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands. The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosking 231&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money. Only 400,000 rubles of church wealth were paid back.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia under the old regime'', p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosking 231&quot; /&gt; Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;madariaga111&quot; /&gt;

In 1762, to help mend the rift between the Orthodox church and a sect that called themselves the [[Old Believers]], Catherine passed an act that allowed Old Believers to practise their faith openly without interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raeff, Marc 1972&quot;&gt;[[Marc Raeff]], ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 294.&lt;/ref&gt; While claiming religious tolerance, she intended to recall the believers into the official church. They refused to comply, and in 1764, she deported over 20,000 Old Believers to Siberia on the grounds of their faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raeff, Marc 1972&quot; /&gt; In later years, Catherine amended her thoughts. Old Believers were allowed to hold elected municipal positions after the Urban Charter of 1785, and she promised religious freedom to those who wished to settle in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hosking|1997|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raef, ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious education was reviewed strictly. At first, she simply attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programs from lay education.&lt;ref&gt;Raeff, Marc. ''Catherine the Great: A Profile'' (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), 298.&lt;/ref&gt; By separating the public interests from those of the church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its people to a segregated community forced to depend on the state for compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosking 231&quot; /&gt;
== Personal life ==
[[File:Orlov greg.jpeg|thumb|upright|Count [[Grigory Orlov]], by [[Fyodor Rokotov]]]]
Catherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions for as long as they held her interest and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Alexander |title=Catherine the Great, life and legend |page=224 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Herman, ''Sex With the Queen'' (2006) pp 147–173.&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10% in 1767 to 11% in 1781 to 14% in 1795. Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762 to 1772, 202,000 from 1773 to 1793, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pipes&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Pipes|title=Russia under the old regime|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |119}} Catherine bought the support of the bureaucracy. In 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants automatically would be promoted regardless of office or merit.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, ''Russia under the old regime,'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

After her affair with her lover and adviser [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin]] ended in 1776, he allegedly selected a candidate-lover for her who had the physical beauty and mental faculties to hold her interest (such as [[Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov]] and Nicholas Alexander Suk&lt;ref&gt;Bushkovitch, Paul. ''A Concise History of Russia''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;). Some of these men loved her in return, and she always showed generosity towards them, even after the affair ended. One of her lovers, Pyotr Zavadovsky, received 50,000 rubles, a pension of 5,000 rubles and 4,000 peasants in Ukraine after she dismissed him in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Michael|year=2001|title=A Treasure of Royal Scandals|page=[https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7 7]|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|place=New York|isbn=978-0-7394-2025-6|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of her lovers, [[Platon Zubov|Prince Zubov]], was 40 years her junior. Her sexual independence led to many of the [[legends of Catherine the Great|legends about her]].&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Rounding, ''Catherine the Great: Love, Sex, and Power'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/Catherine-Great-Virginia-Rounding/dp/0091799929/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine kept her illegitimate son by Grigori Orlov ([[Bobrinsky|Alexis Bobrinsky]], later elevated to Count Bobrinsky by Paul I) near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], away from her court.

In terms of elite acceptance of a female ruler, it was more of an issue in Western Europe than in Russia. The British ambassador [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury]] reported back to London:
: Her Majesty has a masculine force of mind, obstinacy in adhering to a plan, and intrepidity in the execution of it; but she wants the more manly virtues of deliberation, forbearance in prosperity and accuracy of judgment, while she possesses in a high degree the weaknesses vulgarly attributed to her sex-love of flattery, and its inseparable companion, vanity; an inattention to unpleasant but salutary advice; and a propensity to voluptuousness which leads to excesses that would debase a female character in any sphere of life.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Meehan-Waters, &quot;Catherine the Great and the problem of female rule.&quot; ''Russian Review'' 34.3 (1975): 293-307, quoting p. 293 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/127976 online]. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poniatowski ===
[[File:Stanislaw poniatowski bacciarelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], the last King of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]]]

Sir [[Charles Hanbury Williams]], the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanisław Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally. Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the [[Czartoryski family]], prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed by their mutual ancestor King [[Christian I of Denmark]], by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish [[House of Stuart]]. Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, therefore well before encountering the Orlov brothers. In 1757, Poniatowski served in the British Army during the Seven Years' War, thus severing close relationships with Catherine. She bore him a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]], the daughter of Peter I's second marriage).

King [[Augustus III of Poland]] died in 1763, so Poland needed to elect a new ruler. Catherine supported Poniatowski as a candidate to become the next king. She sent the Russian army into Poland to avoid possible disputes. Russia invaded Poland on 26 August 1764, threatening to fight, and imposing Poniatowski as king. Poniatowski accepted the throne, and thereby put himself under Catherine's control. News of Catherine's plan spread, and Frederick II (others say the Ottoman sultan) warned her that if she tried to conquer Poland by marrying Poniatowski, all of Europe would oppose her. She had no intention of marrying him, having already given birth to Orlov's child and to the Grand Duke Paul by then.

Prussia (through the agency of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Prince Henry]]), Russia (under Catherine), and Austria (under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]) began preparing the ground for the [[partitions of Poland]]. In the first partition, 1772, the three powers split {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} among them. Russia got territories east of the line connecting, more or less, [[Riga]]–[[Polotsk]]–[[Mogilev]]. In the second partition, in 1793, Russia received the most land, from west of [[Minsk]] almost to [[Kiev]] and down the river Dnieper, leaving some spaces of [[steppe]] down south in front of [[Ochakiv|Ochakov]], on the [[Black Sea]]. Later uprisings in Poland led to the third partition in 1795. Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McLean, ''The Other East and Nineteenth-Century British Literature: Imagining Poland and the Russian Empire'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012) pp. 14-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orlov ===
[[File:Alexei borinsky.jpeg|thumb|upright|Catherine the Great's natural son by Count Orlov, [[Bobrinsky|Aleksey Grigorievich Bobrinsky]] (1762–1813 in his estate of Bogoroditsk, near Tula), born three months before the deposition by the Orlov brothers of her husband Peter III]]

Grigory Orlov, the grandson of a rebel in the [[Streltsy Uprising]] (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, Catherine and he had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, the Grand Duke Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 coup d’état against her husband, but she preferred to remain the dowager empress of Russia rather than marrying anyone.

Grigory Orlov and his other three brothers found themselves rewarded with titles, money, swords, and other gifts, but Catherine did not marry Grigory, who proved inept at politics and useless when asked for advice. He received a palace in Saint Petersburg when Catherine became empress.

Orlov died in 1783. Their son, Aleksey Grygoriovich Bobrinsky (1762–1813), had one daughter, Maria Alexeyeva Bobrinsky (Bobrinskaya) (1798–1835), who married in 1819 the 34-year-old Prince [[Nikolai Gagarin|Nikolai Sergeevich Gagarin]] (London, England, 1784–1842) who took part in the [[Battle of Borodino]] (7 September 1812) against [[Napoleon]], and later served as ambassador in Turin, the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

=== Potemkin ===
[[File:1000 Potiomkin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Catherine II and Potemkin on the [[Millennium of Russia|Millennium Monument]] in [[Novgorod]]]]
Grigory Potemkin was involved in the coup d'état of 1762. In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him. By the winter of 1773, the [[Pugachev's Rebellion|Pugachev revolt]] had started to threaten. Catherine's son Paul had started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power. She called Potemkin for help—mostly military—and he became devoted to her.

In 1772, Catherine wrote to Potemkin. Days earlier, she had found out about an uprising in the Volga region. She appointed General [[Aleksandr Bibikov]] to put down the uprising, but she needed Potemkin's advice on military strategy. Potemkin quickly gained positions and awards. Russian poets wrote about his virtues, the court praised him, foreign ambassadors fought for his favour, and his family moved into the palace. He later became the de facto absolute ruler of New Russia, governing its colonisation.

In 1780, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], the son of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, toyed with the idea of determining whether or not to enter an alliance with Russia, and asked to meet Catherine. Potemkin had the task of briefing him and travelling with him to Saint Petersburg. Potemkin also convinced Catherine to expand the universities in Russia to increase the number of scientists.

Catherine worried Potemkin's poor health would delay his important work colonizing and developing the south as he had planned. He died at the age of 52 in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Duran, &quot;Catherine II, Potemkin, and colonization policy in Southern Russia.&quot; ''Russian Review'' 28.1 (1969): 23-36 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/126983 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final months and death ==
[[File:Catherine II walking by V.Borovikovskiy (1794, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|upright|1794 portrait of Catherine, age approximately 65, with the [[Chesme Column]] in the background]]

Though Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolph]], visited her in September 1796, the empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grande p. 427&quot;&gt;Henri Troyat in ''Catherine la Grande'' (Swedish translation by Harald Bohrn ''Katarina den stora : 1729–1796'' {{ISBN|978-91-1-952612-0}}) p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1796|5 November}}, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, [[Maria Perekusikhina]], that she had slept better than she had in a long time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rounding, p. 499&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, her breathing shallow and laboured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rounding, p. 499&quot; /&gt; The court physician diagnosed a stroke&lt;ref name=&quot;Rounding, p. 499&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon, p. 315&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite attempts to revive her she fell into a coma. She was given the [[last rites]] and died the following evening around 9:45.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon, p. 315&quot; /&gt; An autopsy confirmed stroke as the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Platon Zubov by Eggink.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Catherine's last favourite [[Platon Zubov]]]]
Later, [[Legends of Catherine the Great#Death narratives|several unfounded stories]] circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death. A popular insult to the empress's legacy at the time is that she died after having sex with her horse. The story claimed that her maids believed that Catherine spent too much unsupervised time with her favourite horse, Dudley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/catherine-the-great | title=How Catherine the Great Shook up Europe's Male Power Structure| date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German scholar [[Adam Olearius]] in his 1647 book ''Beschreibung der muscowitischen und persischen Reise'' claimed that Russians had fondness for sodomy, especially with horses.&lt;ref name=r508&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olearius's claims about a supposed Russian tendency towards bestiality with horses was often repeated in anti-Russian literature throughout the 17th and 18th centuries to illustrate the alleged barbarous &quot;Asian&quot; nature of Russia. Given the frequency which this story was repeated together with Catherine's love of her adopted homeland and her hippophilia, it was an easy step to apply this scurrilous story as the cause of her death.&lt;ref name=r508/&gt; Finally, Catherine's lack of shame about expressing her sexuality together with her incongruous position as a female leader in the male-dominated society of Europe made her the object of much malicious gossip, and the story of her supposed death while attempting sex with a stallion was meant to show how &quot;unnatural&quot; her rule as empress of Russia was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|pp=508–09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was meant to have been a pawn in the European power game who was to be married off to some prince and provide the proverbial &quot;heir and a spare&quot; to continue the dynasty, and in rejecting this role for herself by ruling as empress in her own right provoked a powerful reaction against herself.{{cn|date=August 2020}} 

Catherine's undated will, discovered in early 1792 by her secretary Alexander Vasilievich Khrapovitsky among her papers, gave specific instructions should she die: &quot;Lay out my corpse dressed in white, with a golden crown on my head, and on it inscribe my Christian name. Mourning dress is to be worn for six months, and no longer: the shorter the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the empress was laid to rest with a gold crown on her head and clothed in a silver [[brocade]] dress. On 25 November, the coffin, richly decorated in gold fabric, was placed atop an elevated platform at the Grand Gallery's chamber of mourning, designed and decorated by [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rounding|2006|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixon|2009|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]]: &quot;The empress's body lay in state for six weeks in a large and magnificently decorated room in the castle, which was kept lit day and night. Catherine was stretched on a ceremonial bed surrounded by the coats of arms of all the towns in Russia. Her face was left uncovered, and her fair hand rested on the bed. All the ladies, some of whom took turn to watch by the body, would go and kiss this hand, or at least appear to.&quot; A description of the empress's funeral is written in Madame Vigée Le Brun's memoirs.

Still, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the [[Abbasid]] capital at [[Baghdad]] in 760's, and soon became a [[ghost town]]. [[al-Mansur|Caliph Al-Mansur]] took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast.&lt;ref&gt;Bier, L. (1993). The Sassanian Palaces and their Influence in Early Islam. In Ars Orientalis, 23, 62-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur also used the [[al-Rumiya]] town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |title=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland |date=1895 |publisher=Cambridge University Press for the Royal Asiatic Society |page=40 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed to be the basis for the city of [[Isbanir]] in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

===Modern era===
The ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|a major battle of World War I]] in November 1915. The [[Ottoman Empire]] defeated troops of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some {{convert|40|mi|km}} before [[siege of Kut|trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender]].

== Population and religion ==
Under Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included [[Arameans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch [[Mar Babai I]], fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the [[Merv]] metropolis as pivot. The population also included [[Manicheans]], a Dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during [[Umayyad]] rule fixing their 'patriarchate of Babylon' there.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|the Arab capture of the metropolis]]. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided [[Ali]] with presents, which he, however, refused to take. {{sfn|Morony|2009}} In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk road, in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;John van Schaik, ''Ketters. Een geschiedenis van de Kerk'', Leuven, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
A [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Schippmann |chapter=Ktesiphon-Expedition im Winter 1928/29 |title=Grundzüge der parthischen Geschichte |location=Darmstadt |year=1980 |isbn=3-534-07064-X |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Meyer |title=Seleukia und Ktesiphon |journal=Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zu Berlin |volume=67 |pages=1–26 |year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Reuther |author-link=Oscar Reuther |title=The German Excavations at Ctesiphon |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=434–451 |year=1929 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00003781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Upton |title=The Expedition to Ctesiphon 1931–1932 |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |volume=27 |pages=188–197 |year=1932 |doi=10.2307/3255274 |jstor=3255274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ctes/hd_ctes.htm Fowlkes-Childs, Blair. “Ctesiphon.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the [[University of Turin]] directed by [[Antonio Invernizzi]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Giorgio Gullini|it}} worked at the site, which they identified not as Ctesiphon but as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of [[Khosrau II]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Gullini and A. Invernizzi, First Preliminary Report of Excavations at Seleucia and Ctesiphon.

Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of [[iron–nickel alloy|iron–nickel]] and rock ([[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of [[metallic hydrogen]], an intermediate layer of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid helium]], and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to [[ammonia]] crystals in its upper atmosphere. An [[electrical current]] within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary [[magnetic field]], which is weaker than the Earth's, but has a [[magnetic moment]] 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Saturn, Earth size comparison2.jpg|thumb|left|Composite image comparing the sizes of Saturn and Earth]]

Saturn is a [[gas giant]] because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core.&lt;ref name=melosh2011/&gt; Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an [[oblate spheroid]]; that is, it is [[flattening|flattened]] at the [[geographical pole|poles]] and [[equatorial bulge|bulges]] at its [[equator]]. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268&amp;nbsp;km versus 54,364&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot; /&gt; Jupiter, [[Uranus]], and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, {{Val|8.96|u=m/s2}}, is 74% that at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial [[escape velocity]] of nearly {{Val|36|u=km/s}} is much higher than that for Earth.&lt;ref name=Gregersen2010&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptLFDN0z8gQC&amp;pg=PA119 |title=Outer Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and the Dwarf Planets |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |editor1-first=Erik |editor1-last=Gregersen |page=119 |year=2010 |isbn=978-1615300143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.&lt;ref name=preserve/&gt; Although Saturn's [[planetary core|core]] is considerably denser than water, the average [[relative density|specific density]] of the planet is {{val|0.69|u=g/cm3}} due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times [[Earth mass|Earth's mass]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Jupiter fact&quot;/&gt; and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;/&gt; Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=ssr152_1_423/&gt;

=== Internal structure ===
[[File:Saturn diagram.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of Saturn, to scale]]

Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the [[gas]] [[phase (matter)|phase]], because hydrogen becomes a [[ideal solution|non-ideal liquid]] when the density is above {{val|0.01|u=g/cm3}}, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.&lt;ref name=ssr152_1_423/&gt;

Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various [[volatiles]].&lt;ref name=guillot_et_al2009/&gt; This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's [[gravitational moment]], in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth,&lt;ref name=science305_5689_1414/&gt;&lt;ref name=apj609_2_1170/&gt; which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A383960 |title=Saturn |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 July 2011 |date=2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101024556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A383960 |archive-date=1 January 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is surrounded by a thicker liquid [[metallic hydrogen]] layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated [[molecular hydrogen]] that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000&amp;nbsp;km and consists of gas.&lt;ref name=faure_mensing2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM Saturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windows2universe.org/saturn/interior/S_int_structure_overview.html |title=Structure of Saturn's Interior |publisher=Windows to the Universe |access-date=19 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917140427/http://www.windows2universe.org/saturn/interior/S_int_structure_overview.html |archive-date=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700&amp;nbsp;°C at its core, and it radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's [[thermal energy]] is generated by the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]] of slow [[gravitational compression]], but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the &quot;raining out&quot; of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by [[friction]] and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.&lt;ref name=de_pater_lissauer2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa_saturn/&gt; These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.&lt;ref name=guillot_et_al2009/&gt; Rainfalls of [[diamond]]s have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter&lt;ref name=&quot;SC-20131009&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kramer |first=Miriam |title=Diamond Rain May Fill Skies of Jupiter and Saturn |url=https://www.space.com/23135-diamond-rain-jupiter-saturn.html |date=9 October 2013 |work=[[Space.com]] |access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ice giant]]s Uranus and Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-20170825&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaplan |first=Sarah |title=It rains solid diamonds on Uranus and Neptune |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/08/25/it-rains-solid-diamonds-on-uranus-and-neptune/ |date=25 August 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmosphere ===
[[File:PIA18354-Saturn-MethaneBands-20150906.jpg|thumb|left|[[Methane]] bands circle Saturn. The moon Dione hangs below the rings to the right.]]

The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universeguide.com/Saturn.aspx |title=Saturn |publisher=Universe Guide |access-date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.&lt;ref name=guillot_et_al2009/&gt; The quantity of elements heavier than helium ([[metallicity]]) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the [[Formation of The Solar System|formation of the Solar System]]. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.&lt;ref name=&quot;science286&quot; /&gt;

Trace amounts of ammonia, [[acetylene]], [[ethane]], [[propane]], [[phosphine]], and [[methane]] have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;baas15_831&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cain2009_24029&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pfsaa2008&quot; /&gt; The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either [[ammonium hydrosulfide]] ({{chem2|NH4SH}}) or water.&lt;ref name=&quot;martinez20050905&quot; /&gt; [[Ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun causes methane [[photolysis]] in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of [[hydrocarbon]] chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by [[eddies]] and [[diffusion]]. This [[photochemical cycle]] is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.&lt;ref name=pfsaa2008/&gt;

==== Cloud layers ====
[[File:Saturn Storm.jpg|thumb|left|A global storm girdles the planet in 2011. The storm passes around the planet, such that the storm's head (bright area) passes its tail.]]

Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the ''[[Voyager Space Probe|Voyager]]'' spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based [[telescope|telescopy]] has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.&lt;ref name=emp105_2_143/&gt;

The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with the temperature in the range 100–160&amp;nbsp;K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 [[Bar (unit)|bar]], the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water [[ice cloud]]s begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270&amp;nbsp;K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235&amp;nbsp;K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330&amp;nbsp;K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=dougherty_esposito2009/&gt;

Saturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the ''Voyager'' encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a [[Great White Spot]], a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's [[summer solstice]].&lt;ref name=icarus176_1_155/&gt; Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-link=Patrick Moore |editor1-last=Moore |editor1-first=Patrick |title=1993 Yearbook of Astronomy |journal=1993 Yearbook of Astronomy |location=London |publisher=W.W.

Saturn has an intrinsic [[magnetic field]] that has a simple, symmetric shape – a magnetic [[dipole]]. Its strength at the equator – 0.2&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] (20&amp;nbsp;[[microtesla|µT]]) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name=&quot;mag&quot; /&gt; As a result, Saturn's [[magnetosphere]] is much smaller than Jupiter's.&lt;ref name=&quot;mag 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005921/Saturn/satuAtmo.htm |title=Saturn: Atmosphere and Magnetosphere |publisher=Thinkquest Internet Challenge |access-date=15 July 2007 |last=McDermott |first=Matthew |date=2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020053039/http://library.thinkquest.org/C005921/Saturn/satuAtmo.htm |archive-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Voyager 2]]'' entered the magnetosphere, the [[solar wind]] pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000&amp;nbsp;mi),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/saturn_magnetosphere.html |title=Voyager – Saturn's Magnetosphere |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=18 October 2010 |access-date=19 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319151942/http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/saturn_magnetosphere.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.&lt;ref name=atkinson2010/&gt; Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.&lt;ref name=&quot;mag 2&quot; /&gt; This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the [[solar wind]] particles from the Sun.

The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]]). With an average orbital speed of 9.68&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot; /&gt; it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about {{frac|29|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;years)&lt;ref name=cain2009/&gt; to finish one revolution around the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot; /&gt; As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 [[mean-motion resonance]] with Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Modeling the 5 : 2 Mean-Motion Resonance in the Jupiter-Saturn Planetary System |last1=Michtchenko |first1=T.

Average of the nine extremes on p 273. All are within 0.02&amp;nbsp;AU of the averages.&lt;/ref&gt; The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).

Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. ''System&amp;nbsp;I'' has a period of {{RA|10|14|00}} (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to ''System&amp;nbsp;I''. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as ''System&amp;nbsp;II'' and have been assigned a rotation period of {{RA|10|38|25.4}} (810.76°/d). ''System&amp;nbsp;III'' refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on [[radio astronomy|radio emissions]] from the planet detected by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''Voyager 2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.209.4462.1238|pmid=17811197|bibcode=1980Sci...209.1238K|title=Voyager Detection of Nonthermal Radio Emission from Saturn|journal=Science|volume=209|issue=4462|pages=1238–40|last1=Kaiser|first1=M.

System&amp;nbsp;III has largely superseded System&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=benton2006/&gt;

A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, ''Cassini'' found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately {{RA|10|45|45}} {{+-|{{RA|||36}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-062804.html |title=Scientists Find That Saturn's Rotation Period is a Puzzle |date=28 June 2004 |publisher=NASA |access-date=22 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729155336/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-062804.html |archive-date=29 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cain2008_15298/&gt; The latest estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the ''Cassini'', ''Voyager'' and ''Pioneer'' probes was reported in September 2007 is {{RA|10|32|35}}.&lt;ref name=Anderson2007/&gt;

In March 2007, it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070322.html |title=Enceladus Geysers Mask the Length of Saturn's Day |date=22 March 2007 |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=22 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207134416/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=733 |archive-date=7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=science316_5823_442/&gt;&lt;ref name=science316_5823_380/&gt;

An apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known [[trojan asteroid]]s. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable [[Lagrangian point]]s, designated L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, located at 60° angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for [[Mars]], Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. [[Orbital resonance]] mechanisms, including [[secular resonance]], are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Saturn Trojans: a dynamical point of view |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |display-authors=1 |last1=Hou |first1=X.

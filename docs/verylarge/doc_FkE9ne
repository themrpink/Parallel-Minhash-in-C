Shortly after the coronation most of Charles' territories were overrun by the Austrians, and [[Bavaria]] was occupied by the troops of [[Maria Theresa]]. The emperor fled Munich and resided for almost three years in the ''Palais Barckhaus'' in Frankfurt. Most of Bohemia was lost in December 1742 when the Austrians allowed the French under the Duc de Belle-Isle and the [[François-Marie, 1st duc de Broglie|Duc de Broglie]] an honourable capitulation. Charles Albert was mocked as an emperor who neither controlled his own realm, nor was in effective control of the empire itself, though the institution of the Holy Roman Emperor had largely become symbolic in nature and powerless by that time. A popular Latin saying about him was ''et Caesar et nihil'', meaning &quot;both Emperor and nothing&quot;, a word-play on ''aut Caesar aut nihil'', &quot;either Emperor or nothing&quot;. Charles Albert's general Ignaz Felix, Count of Törring-Jettenbach was compared to a drum, as people ''heard about him only when he was beaten''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsey2018&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=William D.

Charles VII tried to emphasise his government in Frankfurt with numerous acts of law, such as the grant of imperial privilege to the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]] in 1743 and the creation of several new imperial nobles. [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]] was declared to be of full age ahead of time in 1744. [[Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis]] served as Principal Commissioner for Charles VII at the Perpetual Imperial Diet in Frankfurt am Main and in 1744 the [[Thurn und Taxis]] dynasty were appointed hereditary Postmasters General of the Imperial [[Reichspost]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stollberg-Rilinger2018&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3OYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 |title=The Holy Roman Empire: A Short History |date=23 October 2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-17911-7 |pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heb/&gt;

The new commander of the Bavarian army, [[Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff]], fought Austria in a series of battles in 1743 and 1744. In 1743 his troops and their allies took Bavaria and Charles VII was able to return to Munich in April for some time. After the allied French had to retreat after defeats to the Rhine, he lost Bavaria again. The new campaign of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars|Second Silesian War]] finally forced the Austrian army to leave Bavaria and to retreat back into Bohemia. In October 1744 Charles VII regained Munich and returned. Under the mediation of the former Vice-Chancellor [[Friedrich Karl von Schönborn]], the emperor then sought a balance with Vienna, but at the same time negotiated unsuccessfully with France for new military support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whaley2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Joachim Whaley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeqGLXvgH7YC |title=Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume II: The Peace of Westphalia to the Dissolution of the Reich, 1648–1806 |publisher=OUP Oxford |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-969307-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KG&quot; /&gt;

Suffering severely from [[gout]], Charles died at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in January 1745. His brother Klemens August then again leaned towards Austria, and his son and successor [[Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III Joseph]] made peace with Austria. With the [[Treaty of Füssen]] Austria recognized the legitimacy of Charles VII's election as Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;KG&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Galerie Residenz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Ancestral Gallery (Ahnengallerie, 1726–1731), Munich Residenz]]
Charles VII's reign represented the height of the Bavarian [[Rococo]] era. The [[Nymphenburg Palace]] was completed during his reign. The Grand circle (''Schlossrondell''), which is flanked by a string of elaborate [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] mansions was initially planned as a basic blueprint for a new city (''Carlstadt''), but this was not achieved. Charles VII resided in Nymphenburg and the palace became the favorite summer residence of the future lords of Bavaria. Charles effected the building of the Ancestral Gallery and the Ornate Rooms at the [[Munich Residenz]]. He purchased the [[Palais Porcia]] in 1731 and had the mansion restored in Rococo style in 1736 for one of his mistresses, Countess Topor-Morawitzka. The mansion was named after the Countess' husband, Prince Porcia. He also ordered [[François de Cuvilliés]], chief architect of the court, to build the [[Palais Holnstein]] for another one of his mistresses, Sophie Caroline von Ingenheim, Countess Holnstein, between 1733 and 1737. Cuvilliés constructed the [[Amalienburg]] as well for Charles and his wife Maria Amalia, an elaborate hunting lodge designed in Rococo style between 1734 and 1739 in the [[Nymphenburg Palace Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=heb/&gt;

Before and during Charles's reign numerous accomplished German, Italian, French and [[Bavaria]]n architects, sculptors, painters and artisans were employed in royal service, often for many years. Among them were Agostino Barelli, Dominique Girard, François de Cuvilliés, Leo von Klenze, Roman Anton Boos, Friedrich Ludwig Sckell, Joseph Effner, Konrad Eberhard, Joseph Baader, Ignaz Günther, [[Johann Michael Fischer]], [[Cosmas Damian Asam]] and [[Egid Quirin Asam]], [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]], [[Matthäus Günther]], [[Johann Baptist Straub]] and [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Schlosspark Nymphenburg |url=https://www.muenchen.de/sehenswuerdigkeiten/orte/120263.html |publisher=München de |access-date=January 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HDPE Pipeline in a harsh Australian environment.jpg|thumb|264x264px|HDPE pipelines on a mine site in Australia.]]
'''Pipeline transport''' is the long-distance [[transportation]] of a liquid or gas through a system of [[pipe (material)|pipes]]—a pipeline—typically to a market area for consumption. The latest data from 2014 gives a total of slightly less than {{convert|2,175,000|mi|km}} of pipeline in 120 countries of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2117.html |title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency |website=www.cia.gov |access-date=September 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821003050/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2117.html |archive-date=August 21, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and Canada had 3%, thus 75% of all pipeline were in these three countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

''Pipeline and Gas Journal'''s worldwide survey figures indicate that {{convert|118,623|mi|km}} of pipelines are planned and under construction. Of these, {{convert|88,976|mi|km}} represent projects in the planning and design phase; {{convert|29,647|mi|km}} reflect pipelines in various stages of construction. Liquids and gases are transported in pipelines, and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pipeline101.com/why-do-we-need-pipelines/what-do-pipelines-transport | title=Pipeline transport | access-date=26 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211184128/http://www.pipeline101.com/why-do-we-need-pipelines/what-do-pipelines-transport | archive-date=11 February 2015 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum, [[fuel]]s – such as oil, natural gas and biofuels – and other fluids including [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]], [[beer]], hot water or [[steam]] for shorter distances. Pipelines are useful for transporting water for [[drinking water|drinking]] or [[irrigation]] over long distances when it needs to move over [[hill]]s, or where [[canal]]s or [[channel (geography)|channels]] are poor choices due to considerations of [[evaporation]], [[pollution]], or environmental impact. {{Transport}}Oil pipelines are made from [[steel]] or [[HDPE pipe|plastic tubes]] which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by [[pump]] stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are pressurized into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/transport/|title=» The Transportation of Natural Gas NaturalGas.org|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas pipelines are constructed of [[carbon steel]]. [[Hydrogen pipeline transport]] is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe. Pipelines are one of the safest ways of transporting materials as compared to road or rail, and hence in war, pipelines are often the target of military attacks.

It is uncertain when the first [[crude oil]] pipeline was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Jonathan|title=How the Oil Pipeline Began|url=http://nautil.us/issue/50/emergence/how-the-oil-pipeline-began|access-date=6 July 2017|work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)]]|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} with competing claims for [[Vladimir Shukhov]] and the [[Branobel]] company in the late 19th century, and the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} wrought iron pipeline over a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in [[Oil Creek State Park#History|Oil Creek]], in the 1860s. Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil, [[refined oil products]] or [[natural gas]] over land. For example, in 2014, pipeline transport of crude oil cost about $5 per barrel, while rail transport cost about $10 to $15 per barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; Trucking has even higher costs due to the additional labor required; employment on completed pipelines represents only &quot;1% of that of the trucking industry.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepac.cheme.cmu.edu/pasi2008/slides/cerda/library/slides/jcerda-pasi-2008-1page.pdf |title=Oil Pipeline Logistics |publisher=Cepac.cheme.cmu.edu |access-date=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 70% of crude oil and petroleum products are shipped by pipeline. (23% are by ship, 4% by truck, and 3% by rail)  In Canada for natural gas and petroleum products, 97% are shipped by pipeline.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt;

Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurized into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Small NGL processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of {{convert|125|psi|kPa}}, can be shipped by rail, truck or pipeline. Propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch. EG: Propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure, 100 psi, give or take depending on temperature, and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than {{convert|125|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} at retail stations. Pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at {{convert|250|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.[[File:Pipeline-small image, seen from below.jpeg|thumb|200px|An elevated section of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alaska Pipeline]].]]The distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter, as thousands of [[natural-gas processing]] plants are located in or near oil fields. Many [[Bakken Formation|Bakken]] Basin oil companies in North Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan gas fields separate the NGLs in the field, allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers, eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane.

The most recent major pipeline to start operating in North America, is a TransCanada natural gas line going north across the Niagara region bridges with Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources, into the Canadian province of Ontario as of the fall of 2012, supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in Ontario.

[[File:Major russian gas pipelines to europe.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Major Russian gas pipelines to Europe in 2009]]
This new US-supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to Ontario from western Canada in Alberta and Manitoba, thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer.  To avoid delays and US government regulation, many small, medium and large oil producers in North Dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to Canada to meet up with a Canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east. This allows the Bakken Basin and Three Forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the US. The distance from the biggest oil patch in North Dakota, in [[Williston, North Dakota]], is only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the Canada–US border and [[Manitoba]]. [[Mutual fund]]s and [[joint venture]]s are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines. In the fall of 2012, the US began exporting [[propane]] to Europe, known as LPG, as wholesale prices there are much higher than in North America. Additionally, a pipeline is currently being constructed from North Dakota to Illinois, commonly known as the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About {{!}} Dakota Access Pipeline|url=https://daplpipelinefacts.com/About.html|access-date=2020-10-09|website=daplpipelinefacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more North American pipelines are built, even more exports of LNG, propane, butane, and other natural gas products occur on all three US coasts. To give insight, North Dakota Bakken region's oil production has grown by 600% from 2007 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/dpr-full.pdf|title=Drilling Productivity Report|date=November 2017|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price, and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery. However, pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume.

Enbridge in Canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west (Line 9) and expanding it and using it to ship western Canadian bitumen oil eastward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/projects/pipeline_journey.html |title=Line 9: Journey along the pipeline &amp;#124; Toronto Star |work=Thestar.com |date=2014-01-17 |access-date=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline, it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day. It will bring western oil to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Quebec and New York by early 2014. New Brunswick will also refine some of this western Canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to Europe from its deep water oil ULCC loading port.

Although pipelines can be built under the sea, that process is economically and technically demanding, so the majority of oil at sea is transported by [[tanker (ship)|tanker ships]]. Similarly, it is often more economically feasible to transport natural gas in the form of LNG, however the break-even point between LNG and pipelines would depend on the volume of natural gas and the distance it travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulvestad|first1= Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title= Natural gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=69|issue=3|pages=407–426|pmc=3962073|doi= 10.1080/00207233.2012.677581|pmid= 24683269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enbridge [[Sandpiper pipeline]] is proposed to transfer valuable oil from Western North Dakota through northwestern Minnesota. The pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter. It will carry over 300,000 barrels of oil a day with a volatility of 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandpiper&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honorearth.org/enbridge_sandpiper_pipeline |title=Enbridge Sandpiper Pipeline |publisher=Honorearth.org |access-date=2015-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222133526/http://www.honorearth.org/enbridge_sandpiper_pipeline |archive-date=2015-02-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of market===
[[File:Gasoducto junto a la B-145, Chile, 2016-02-09, DD 36.JPG|thumb|Gas pipe in the dry region of Antofagasta, Chile.]]
The market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous
growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008. After faltering in 2009, demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1977 &quot;Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline Construction in the U.S.: Market Research Report],&quot; November 2012, IBISWorld.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, almost 32,000 miles of North American pipeline were being planned or under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;pipelineandgasjournal.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/2012-worldwide-pipeline-construction-report &quot;2012 Worldwide Pipeline Construction Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325081749/http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/2012-worldwide-pipeline-construction-report |date=2013-03-25 }},&quot; ''Pipeline and Gas Journal'' '''239''' (1). January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When pipelines are constrained, additional pipeline product transportation options may include the use of drag reducing agents, or by transporting product via truck or rail.

===Construction and operation===
Oil pipelines are made from [[steel]] or [[HDPE pipe|plastic tubes]] with inner diameter typically from {{convert|4|to|48|in}}. Most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about {{convert|3|to|6|ft}}. To protect pipes from [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], and [[corrosion]], a variety of methods are used. These can include [[wood lagging]] (wood slats), [[concrete]] coating, rockshield, [[HDPE pipe|high-density polyethylene]], imported sand padding, and padding machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;asme&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Crude oil contains varying amounts of [[paraffin wax]] and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline. Often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using [[pigging]], the practice of using devices known as &quot;pigs&quot; to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline. The devices are also known as &quot;scrapers&quot; or &quot;Go-devils&quot;. &quot;Smart pigs&quot; (also known as &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; pigs) are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents, metal loss caused by corrosion, cracking or other mechanical damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/go-devil go-devil – definition of go-devil] by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; These devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream, either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line.

For natural gas, pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from {{convert|2|to|60|in}} in diameter, depending on the type of pipeline. The gas is pressurized by [[compressor station]]s and is odorless unless mixed with a [[thiol|mercaptan odorant]] where required by a regulating authority.

==Ammonia==

In the US minimal amounts of ethanol are transported by pipeline.  Most ethanol is shipped by rail,  the main alternatives being truck and barge. Delivering ethanol by pipeline is the most desirable option, but ethanol's affinity for water and solvent properties require the use of a dedicated pipeline, or significant cleanup of existing pipelines.

==Coal and ore==
[[Slurry pipeline]]s are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines. The material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline; at the far end, the material must be dried. One example is a {{convert|525|km|adj=on}} slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the [[Minas-Rio]] mine (producing 26.5 million tonnes per year) to the [[Superporto do Açu|Port of Açu]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/project-profile/en/Minas-Rio-Minas-Rio|access-date=2010-12-12|title=Project Profiles, Minas-Rio|date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An existing example is the {{convert|85|km|adj=on}} Savage River Slurry pipeline in [[Tasmania]], Australia, possibly the world's first when it was built in 1967.

==Water==
{{see also|Aqueduct (watercourse)|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:LA Aqueduct Antelope Valley.jpg|thumb|The [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in [[Antelope Valley]].]]
Two millennia ago, the [[Roman Empire|ancient Romans]] made use of large [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed [[gravity]] to push the water along until it reached its destination. Hundreds of these were built throughout Europe and elsewhere, and along with [[flour mill]]s were considered the lifeline of the Roman Empire. The [[history of China|ancient Chinese]] also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works. The famous [[Han Dynasty]] court [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] [[Zhang Rang]] (d. 189&amp;nbsp;AD) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet [[chain pump]]s outside the capital city of [[Luoyang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 33&quot;&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These chain pumps serviced the imperial [[palace]]s and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a [[stoneware]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 2 345 346&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 345–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipelines are useful for transporting water for [[drinking water|drinking]] or [[irrigation]] over long distances when it needs to move over [[hill]]s, or where [[canal]]s or [[channel (geography)|channels]] are poor choices due to considerations of [[evaporation]], [[pollution]], or environmental impact.

The {{convert|530|km|miles|abbr=on}} [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]] in [[Western Australia]] using 750&amp;nbsp;mm (30&amp;nbsp;inch) pipe and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040174b.htm Mephan Ferguson] Australian Dictionary of Biography(online version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1489302.htm The Forrest family] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817224729/http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1489302.htm |date=2016-08-17 }} ''Dynasties'', ABC.

Examples of significant water pipelines in [[South Australia]] are the [[Morgan Whyalla pipeline|Morgan-Whyalla pipeline]] (completed 1944) and [[Mannum-Adelaide pipeline]] (completed 1955) pipelines, both part of the larger [[Snowy Mountains scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sawater.com.au/SAWater/WhatsNew/NewsRoom/Mannum+Adelaide+Celebrations.htm |title=Mannum Adelaide Celebrations |publisher=SA Water |access-date=2015-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503090622/http://www.sawater.com.au/SAWater/WhatsNew/NewsRoom/Mannum+Adelaide+Celebrations.htm |archive-date=2015-05-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two [[Los Angeles, California]] aqueducts, the ''[[Owens Valley aqueduct]]'' (completed 1913) and the ''[[Los Angeles aqueduct#Second Los Angeles Aqueduct|Second Los Angeles Aqueduct]]'' (completed 1970) which also include extensive use of pipelines.

The [[Great Manmade River]] of Libya supplies {{convert|3680000|m3|cuyd}} of water each day to Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte, and several other cities in Libya.

{{Main|District heating}}District heating or ''teleheating'' systems consist of a network of [[insulated pipe|insulated]] feed and return pipes which transport heated water, [[pressurized hot water]], or sometimes [[steam]] to the customer. While steam is hottest and may be used in [[industrial process]]es due to its higher temperature, it is less [[thermal efficiency|efficient]] to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway's district heating network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf|title = Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate|access-date = 2011-09-25|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144652/http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf|archive-date = 2011-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

District heating pipelines are normally installed underground, with some exceptions. Within the system, [[thermal energy storage|heat storage]] may be installed to even out peak load demands. Heat is transferred into the [[central heating]] of the dwellings through [[heat exchanger]]s at [[district heating substation|heat substations]], without mixing of the fluids in either system.

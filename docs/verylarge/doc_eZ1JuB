It is also known as the [[love padlocks]]-decorated bridge in Ljubljana.

====The Triple Bridge====
[[File:Ljubljana in Ljubljanica.jpg|thumb|The scenic Triple Bridge, decorated with stone balusters and stone lamps on all of the three bridges]]
The [[Triple Bridge]] is decorated with stone [[baluster]]s and stone lamps on all of the three bridges and leads to the terraces looking on the river and poplar trees. It occupies a central point on the east-west axis, connecting the [[Tivoli City Park]] with [[Rožnik Hill]], on one side, and the [[Ljubljana Castle]] on the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitljubljana.com/en/directory/sights-attractions/1821/detail.html |title=Triple Bridge |work=visitljubljana.com |accessdate=15 May 2012 |publisher=Ljubljana Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the north-south axis through the city, represented by the river. It was enlarged in order to prevent the historically single bridge from being a [[Bottleneck (traffic)|bottleneck]] by adding two side [[pedestrian]] bridges to the middle one.

====The Fish Footbridge====
The Fish Footbridge offers a good view of the neighbouring Triple Bridge to the north and the Cobbler's Bridge to the South. It is a transparent glass-made bridge, which is illuminated at night by in-built LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleetwoodurban.com.au/inspiration/global/ribja-brv-girder Ribja brv Girder Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327094423/http://www.fleetwoodurban.com.au/inspiration/global/ribja-brv-girder |date=27 March 2018 }}, www.fleetwoodurban.com.au,&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 2014 the bridge was a wooden one and decorated with flowers, while since its reconstruction in 2014, it is made of glass. It was planned already in 1895 by [[Max Fabiani]] to build a bridge on the location, in 1913 [[Alfred Keller]] planned a staircase, later [[Jože Plečnik]] incorporated both into his own plans which, however, were not realised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/ribja-brv-v-novi-preobleki/347367 Ribja brv v novi 'preobleki'], MMC RTV Slovenia, 27 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Cobbler's Bridge====
The 1930 'Cobblers' Bridge' ({{lang|sl|Šuštarski}}, from German {{lang|de|Schuster}} – Shoemaker) is another [[Plečnik]]'s creation, connecting two major areas of medieval Ljubljana. It is decorated by two kinds of pillars, the [[Corinthian pillar]]s which delineate the shape of the bridge itself and the [[Ionic order|Ionic pillars]] as lamp-bearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://kongres-magazine.eu/2017/05/cobblers-bridge-cevljarski-most/ | title=Cobblers' Bridge (Čevljarski most)| date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Trnovo Bridge====
[[File:Trnovo_Bridge.jpg|thumb|Trnovo Bridge]]
The Trnovo Bridge is the most prominent object of Plečnik's renovation of the banks of the Gradaščica. It is located in the front of the [[Trnovo Church]] to the south of the city centre. It connects the neighbourhoods of [[Krakovo]] and [[Trnovo, Ljubljana|Trnovo]], the oldest Ljubljana suburbs, known for their market gardens and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chapter: The Suburbs of Krakovo and Trnovo |page=30 |work=Ljubljana Tourist Guide |publisher=Ljubljana Tourism |url=http://issuu.com/visitljubljana/docs/ljubljana-tourist-guide?mode=window&amp;pageNumber=30 |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is distinguished by its width and two rows of [[birch]]es that it bears, because it was meant to serve as a public space in front of the church. Each corner of the bridge is capped with a small pyramid, a signature motif of Plečnik's, whereas the mid-span features a pair of [[Art-Deco]] male sculptures. There is also a statue of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] on the bridge, the patron of the Trnovo Church. It was designed by {{nowrap|[[Nikolaj Pirnat]]}}.

Existing already in the 18th century, Ljubljana's central square, [[Prešeren Square (Ljubljana)|Prešeren Square]]'s modern appearance has developed since the end of the 19th century. After the 1895 earthquake, [[Max Fabiani]] designed the square as the hub of four streets and four banks, and in the 1980s [[Edvard Ravnikar]] proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenia.info/?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=765&amp;lng=1 |title=Ljubljana, Tromostovje |work=slovenia.info |publisher=Slovenian Tourist Board |accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-YLJCEM5D/ |title=Prešernov trg v Ljubljani |first=Breda |last=Mihelič |language=sl, en|trans-title=Prešeren Square in Ljubljana |journal=Zbornik za umetnostno zgodovino [Collection of Art History Papers] |year=1999 |volume=35 |pages=94–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of the Slovene [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[France Prešeren]] with a [[muse]] stands in the middle of the square.

[[Congress Square]] ({{lang|sl|Kongresni trg}}) is one of the most important centres of the city. It was built in 1821 for ceremonial purposes such as [[Congress of Laibach|Congress of Ljubljana]] after which it was named. Since then it became an important centre for political ceremonies, demonstrations and protests, such as the ceremony at creation of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], ceremony of liberation of [[Belgrade]], protests against [[JBTZ trial|Yugoslav authority]] in 1988 etc. The square also houses several important buildings, such as the [[University of Ljubljana|University of Ljubljana Palace]], [[Slovenian Philharmonic|Philharmonic Hall]], [[Ursuline Church of the Holy Trinity]], and the [[Slovene Society|Slovene Society Building]]. Star Park ({{lang|sl|Park Zvezda}}) is located in the centre of the square. In 2010 and 2011, the square was heavily renovated and is now mostly closed to road traffic on ground area, however there are five floors for commercial purposes and a parking lot located underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/foto-zgodbe-ki-so-se-dogajale-na-kongresnem-trgu/260463 |title=Zgodbe, ki so se dogajale na Kongresnem trgu |language=sl |trans-title=News from Congress Square |accessdate=9 October 2011 |publisher=Radiotelevizija Slovenija}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Čop Street]] ({{lang|sl|Čopova ulica}}) is a major thoroughfare in the centre of Ljubljana. The street is named after [[Matija Čop]], an early 19th-century literary figure and close friend of the Slovene [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[France Prešeren]]. It leads from the [[Main Post Office Palace (Ljubljana)|Main Post Office]] ({{lang|sl|Glavna pošta}}) at [[Slovene Street (Ljubljana)|Slovene Street]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenska cesta}}) downward to Prešeren Square and is lined with bars and stores, including the oldest [[McDonald's|McDonald's restaurant]] in Slovenia.

==Culture==
===Accent===

The Ljubljana accent and/or dialect ({{lang-sl|ljubljanščina}} {{IPA-sl|luːblɑːŋʃnɑː||lublansna.ogg}}) is considered a border dialect, since Ljubljana is situated where the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper]] dialect and [[Lower Carniolan dialect group]] meet. Historically,&lt;ref name=&quot;Osnove Trubarjevega jezika&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |title=Osnove Trubarjevega jezika |journal=Jezik in Slovstvo |date=1965 |volume=10 |issue=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ljubljana dialect in the past displayed features more similar with the Lower Carniolan dialect group, but it gradually grew closer to the Upper dialect group, as a direct consequence of mass migration from Gorenjska region into Ljubljana in the 19th and 20th century. Ljubljana as a city grew mostly to the north, and gradually incorporated many villages that were historically part of [[Upper Carniola]] and so its dialect shifted away and closer to the [[Upper Carniolan dialect group|Upper]] dialects. The Ljubljana dialect has also been used as a literary means in novels, such as in the novel ''Nekdo drug'' by [[Branko Gradišnik]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjurin_Gradisnik&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobiss.si/scripts/cobiss?command=DISPLAY&amp;base=cobib&amp;lani=en&amp;rid=16904448|title=Velemir Gjurin: Beseda avtorju. In: Nekdo drug|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in poems, such as ''Pika Nogavička'' (Slovene for [[Pippi Longstocking]]) by [[Andrej Rozman - Roza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blažič_Rozman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobiss.si/scripts/cobiss?command=DISPLAY&amp;base=cobib&amp;lani=en&amp;rid=37473378 |title=Ljubljanščina in druga stilna sredstva v besedilih Andreja Rozmana Roze na primeru Pike Nogavičke.

The central position of Ljubljana and its dialect had crucial impact&lt;ref name=&quot;Osnove Trubarjevega jezika&quot;/&gt; on the development of the Slovenian language. It was the speech of 16th century Ljubljana that [[Primož Trubar]] a Slovenian [[Protestant Reformers|Protestant Reformer]] took as a foundation of what later became standard [[Slovenian language]], with a small addition of his native speech, the [[Lower Carniolan dialect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osnove Trubarjevega jezika&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |title=Nekdanja ljubljanščina kot osnova Trubarjevega jezika |journal=Začetki Slovenskega Knjižnega Jezika |date=1965 |pages=100–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ljubljana, he lived in a house, on today's Ribji trg, in the oldest part of the city. Living in Ljubljana had a profound impact on his work; he considered Ljubljana the capital of all [[Slovenes]], not only because of its central position in the heart of the [[Slovene lands]], but also because it always had an essentially Slovene character. Most of its inhabitants spoke Slovene as their mother tongue, unlike other cites in today's [[Slovenia]]. It is estimated that in Trubar's time around 70% of Ljubljana's 4000 inhabitants attended mass in the Slovene language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osnove Trubarjevega jezika&quot;/&gt; Trubar considered Ljubljana's speech most suitable, since it sounded much more noble, than his own simple dialect of his hometown [[Rašica, Velike Lašče|Rašica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rigler |first1=Jakob |title=Začetki slovenskega knjižnega jezika. The Origins of the Slovene Literary Language, Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti |journal=Razred Za Filoloske in Literarne Vede |date=1968 |volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trubar's choice was later adopted also by other Protestant writers in the 16th century, and ultimately led to a formation of a more standard language.

===In literary fiction===
Ljubljana appears in the 2005 ''[[The Historian]]'', written by [[Elisabeth Kostova]], and is called by its Roman name (Emona).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Historian]]'', [http://www.bookbrowse.com/excerpts/index.cfm/book_number/1589/page_number/3/the-historian excerpt] from the novel, p.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Ljubljana is also the setting of [[Paulo Coelho]]'s 1998 novel ''[[Veronika Decides to Die]]''.

===Festivals===
Each year, over 10,000 cultural events take place in the city, including ten international theatre, music, and art festivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoIntro&quot;/&gt; The [[Ljubljana Festival]] is one of the two oldest festivals in former Yugoslavia (the [[Dubrovnik Summer Festival]] was established in 1950, and the Ljubljana Festival one in 1953).

[[File:Slovenian Railway Museum 2010.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Interior of the Slovenian Railway Museum]]
[[File:NationalGallery-Ljubljana.JPG|thumb|left|Main building of the Slovenian National Gallery]]
Ljubljana has numerous [[art museum|art galleries]] and museums. The first purpose-built art gallery in Ljubljana was the [[Jakopič Pavilion]], which was in the first half of the 20th century the central exhibition venue of Slovene artists. In the early 1960s, it was succeeded by the [[Ljubljana City Art Gallery]], which has presented a number of modern Slovene and foreign artists. In 2010, there were 14 museums and 56 art galleries in Ljubljana.&lt;ref name=&quot;InNumbers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers/ |title=Ljubljana in Figures |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419120715/http://www.ljubljana.si/en/about-ljubljana/ljubljana-in-numbers |archive-date=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is for example an architecture museum, [[Slovenian Railway Museum|a railway museum]], a school museum, a sports museum, a museum of modern art, a museum of contemporary art, a [[Pivovarna Union|brewery museum]], the [[Slovenian Museum of Natural History]] and the Slovene Ethnographic Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pointinteret&quot;/&gt; The [[National Gallery of Slovenia|National Gallery]] ({{lang|sl|Narodna galerija}}), founded in 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Histo5&quot;/&gt; and the [[Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana)|Museum of Modern Art]] ({{lang|sl|Moderna galerija}}) exhibit the [[List of Slovenian artists|most influential Slovenian artists]].

===Entertainment and performing arts===
[[File:Ljubljanska Opera 2.jpg|thumb|The front of the [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre|Opera and Ballet Theatre]]]]
[[File:SNG-Drama-Ljubljana.JPG|thumb|The Slovenian National Theatre]]
[[Cankar Hall]] is the largest Slovenian cultural and congress center with multiple halls and a large foyer in which art film festivals, artistic performances, book fairs, and other cultural events are held.

====Cinema====
The cinema in Ljubljana appeared for the first time at the turn of the 20th century, and quickly gained popularity among the residents. After World War II, the [[Cinema Company Ljubljana]], later named ''Ljubljana Cinematographers'', was established and managed a number of already functioning movie theatres in Ljubljana, including the only Yugoslav children's theatre. A number of cinema festivals took place in the 1960s, and a [[cinematheque]] opened its doors in 1963. With the advent of television, video, and recently the Internet, most cinema theatres in Ljubljana closed, and the cinema mainly moved to [[Kolosej]], a [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] in the [[BTC City]]. It features twelve screens, including an [[IMAX 3D]] screen. The remaining theatres are [[Kino Komuna]], [[Kinodvor]], where art movies are accompanied by events, and the [[Slovenian Cinematheque]].

====Classical music, opera and ballet====
The [[Slovenian Philharmonics]] is the central music institution in Ljubljana and Slovenia. It holds [[classical music]] concerts of domestic and foreign performers as well as educates youth. It was established in 1701 as part of [[Academia operosorum Labacensis]] and is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. The [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] also resides in Ljubljana, presenting a wide variety of domestic and foreign, modern and classic, opera, ballet and concert works. It serves as the national opera and ballet house. Numerous music festivals are held in Ljubljana, chiefly in [[Classical music|European classical music]] and jazz, for instance the [[Ljubljana Summer Festival]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski poletni festival}}), and [[Trnfest]].

====Theatre====
In addition to the main houses, with the [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana|SNT Drama Ljubljana]] as the most important among them, a number of small producers are active in Ljubljana, involved primarily in [[physical theatre]] (e.g. [[Betontanc]]), [[street theatre]] (e.g. [[Ana Monró Theatre]]), [[theatresports]] championship [[Impro League]], and [[improvisational theatre]] (e.g. [[IGLU Theatre]]). A popular form is [[puppetry]], mainly performed in the [[Ljubljana Puppet Theatre]]. Theatre has a rich tradition in Ljubljana, starting with the 1867 first ever Slovene-language drama performance.

====Modern dance====
The [[modern dance]] was presented in Ljubljana for the first time at the end of the 19th century and developed rapidly since the end of the 1920s. Since the 1930s when in Ljubljana was founded a [[Mary Wigman]] dance school, the first one for modern dance in Slovenia, the field has been intimately linked to the development in Europe and the United States. [[Ljubljana Dance Theatre]] is today the only venue in Ljubljana dedicated to [[contemporary dance]]. Despite this, there's a vivid happening in the field.

====Folk dance====
Several [[folk dance]] groups are active in Ljubljana.

====Jazz====
In July 2015, over four days, the 56th Ljubljana Jazz Festival took place. A member of the European Jazz Network, the festival presented 19 concerts featuring artists from 19 countries, including a celebration of the 75th birthday of [[James &quot;Blood&quot; Ulmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europejazz.net/articles/ljubljana-jazz-festival-july-2015|title=Ljubljana Jazz Festival – July 2015 – Europe Jazz Network|work=europejazz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s with the emergence of [[subculture]]s in Ljubljana, an alternative culture begun to develop in Ljubljana organised around two student organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsEpW9kbyosC&amp;pg=PA198 |title=Culture and Technology in the New Europe: Civic Discourse in Transformation |chapter=Video as Civic Discourse in Slovenia and the Former Yugoslavia: Strategies of Visualization and the Aesthetics of Video in the New Europe: Ljubljana's Alternative or Subculture(e/al) Movement |pages=198–202 |first1=Marina |last1=Gržinić |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2000 |first2=Laura |last2=B.

;Metelkova and Rog
A Ljubljana equivalent of the Copenhagen's [[Freetown Christiania]], a self-proclaimed autonomous [[Metelkova]] neighbourhood, was set up in a former Austro-Hungarian barracks that were built in 1882 (completed in 1911).&lt;ref name=&quot;Metelkova&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana-life.com/ljubljana/metelkova | title=Metelkova |publisher=ljubljana-life.com |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metelkova mesto&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Metelkova mesto |publisher=culture.si |accessdate=23 September 2018| url=https://www.culture.si/en/Metelkova_mesto_Autonomous_Cultural_Zone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the seven buildings and 12,500 m2 of space were turned into art galleries, artist studios, and seven nightclubs, including two LGBTQ+ venues, playing host to all range of music from hardcore to jazz to dub to techno. Adjacent to the Metelkova are located the [[Celica Hostel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CelicaHostel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana-life.com/sleep/hotels_details/9-Celica_Hostel |title=Celica Hostel |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rooms all artistically decorated by the Metelkova artists, and a new part of the Museum of Modern Art, [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Ljubljana|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CalgaryHerald&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://theprovince.com/travel/Ljubljana+easy+love+explore/6912326/story.html |title=Lovely Ljubljana; Its name is hard to pronounce, but the city's easy to love and explore |newspaper=[[The Calgary Herald]] |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative culture centre is located in the former [[Rog (factory)|Rog factory]]. Both [[Metelkova]] and [[Rog (factory)|Rog factory]] factory located in [[Tabor, Ljubljana|Tabor]] neighbourhood are walking distance from the city centre and visited by various tours.

;Šiška Cultural Quarter
The [[Šiška Cultural Quarter]] hosts a number of art groups and cultural organisations dedicated to contemporary and avant-garde arts. Part of it is also [[Kino Šiška Centre for Urban Culture]], a venue where music concerts of indie, punk, and rock bands as well as exhibitions take place. [[Museum of Transitory Art]] (MoTA) is a museum without a permanent collection or a fixed space. Instead, its programs are realised in different locations and contexts in temporary physical and virtual spaces dedicated to advancing the research, production and presentation of transitory, experimental, and live art forms. Yearly MoTA organises Sonica Festival. [[Ljudmila (hackerspace)|Ljudmila]] (since 1994) strives to connect research practices, technologies, science, and art.

==Sports==
===Clubs===
A tension between German and Slovene residents dominated the development of sport of Ljubljana in the 19th century. The first sport club in Ljubljana was the [[South Sokol Gymnastic Club]] ({{lang|sl|Gimnastično društvo Južni Sokol}}), established in 1863 and succeeded in 1868 by the [[Ljubljana Sokol]] ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski Sokol}}). It was the parent club of all Slovene [[Sokol]] clubs as well as an encouragement for the establishment of the [[Croatian Sokol]] club in Zagreb. Members were also active in culture and politics, striving for greater integration of the Slovenes from different Crown lands of [[Austria–Hungary]] and for their cultural, political, and economic independence.

In 1885, German residents established the first sports club in the territory of nowadays Slovenia, {{lang|de|[[Der Laibacher Byciklistischer Club]]}} (''Ljubljana Cycling Club''). In 1887, Slovene cyclists established the [[Slovene Cyclists Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenski biciklistični klub}}). In 1893 followed the first Slovene [[Alpine club]], named [[Slovene Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Slovensko planinsko društvo}}), later succeeded by the [[Alpine Association of Slovenia]] ({{lang|sl|Planinska zveza Slovenije}}). Several of its branches operate in Ljubljana, the largest of them being the [[Ljubljana Matica Alpine Club]] ({{lang|sl|Planinsko društvo Ljubljana-Matica}}). In 1900, the sports club {{lang|de|Laibacher Sportverein}} (English: ''Ljubljana Sports Club'') was established by the city's German residents and functioned until 1909. In 1906, Slovenes organised themselves in its Slovene counterpart, the Ljubljana Sports Club ({{lang|sl|Ljubljanski športni klub}}). Its members were primarily interested in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], but also swimming and football. In 1911, the first Slovene football club, ''[[ND Ilirija|Ilirija]]'', started operating in the city. Winter sports started to develop in the area of the nowadays Ljubljana already before World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDDolomiti2012-01-05&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sddolomiti.si/?page_id=172 |title=Zgodovina |trans-title=History |publisher=Sports Club Dolomiti |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the first [[ice hockey]] club in Slovenia (then Yugoslavia) [[HDD Olimpija Ljubljana|SK Ilirija]] was established.

Nowadays, the city's [[Association football|football]] team which plays in the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]] is [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|NK Olimpija Ljubljana]]. Ljubljana's [[ice hockey]] clubs are [[HK Slavija Ljubljana|HK Slavija]] and [[HK Olimpija]]. They both compete in the [[Slovenian Ice Hockey League|Slovenian Hockey League]]. The basketball teams are [[KD Slovan]] and [[KK Cedevita Olimpija]]. The latter, which has a green dragon as its mascot, hosts its matches at the 12,480-seat [[Arena Stožice]]. Handball is more or less popular in female section. [[RK Krim]] is one of the best women handball team in Europe. They won [[EHF Champions League]] twice, also 2nd and 3rd places are not a rare thing. [[AMTK Ljubljana]] is the most successful [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] club in Slovenia. The Ljubljana Sports Club has been succeeded by the [[Livada Canoe and Kayak Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Habič1997SPM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.geopedia.si/?params=T105_L7452_F1327#T105_L7452_F1327_x462354_y99219_s17_b4 |chapter=Ljubljanica se leno vije proti mestu |trans-chapter=The Ljubljanica River, as It Winds Lazily Towards the Town |title=Prestolnica Ljubljana nekoč in danes |trans-title=A Pictorial Chronicle of a Capital City |work=Geopedia.si |first=Marko |last=Habič |publisher=National Publishing House of Slovenia |year=1997 |isbn=978-86-341-2007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass sport activities===
[[File:VW20LM 25.10.2015 FOTO DAMJAN KONČAR -1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ljubljana Marathon]], 2015]]
Each year since 1957, on 8–10 May, the traditional recreational ''[[Trail of Remembrance and Comradeship|Walk Along the Wire]]'' has taken place to mark the liberation of Ljubljana on 9 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/1283111/thousands-join-ljubljana-hike |title=Thousands Join Ljubljana Hike |date=10 May 2008 |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency [STA]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same occasion, a triples competition is run on the trail, and a few days later, a student run from Prešeren Square to Ljubljana Castle is held.

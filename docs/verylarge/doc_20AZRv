Wirral musician Dean Johnson created the musical ''[[Bullets and Daffodils]]'', based on music set to Owen's poetry, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilfredowenstory.com/welshdailypost.pdf|title=Bullet Points|author=Welsh Daily Post|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the British indie rock band, [[The Libertines]], released an album entitled ''[[Anthems For Doomed Youth]]''; this featured the track &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;, named after Owen's poem.

His poetry is sampled multiple times on the 2000 [[Jedi Mind Tricks]] album ''[[Violent by Design]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-muerte-lyrics|title=Jedi Mind Tricks – Muerte|website=Genius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/40296/Jedi-Mind-Tricks-Violent-by-Design/|title=Jedi Mind Tricks – Violent by Design (album review)|website=Sputnikmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]] has been widely acclaimed for his sampling on the album, and inclusion of Owen's poetry.

An '''advance-fee scam''' is a form of [[fraud]] and one of the most common types of [[confidence tricks]]. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster requires in order to obtain the large sum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim or simply disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/advance-fee-schemes/|title=Advance Fee Scams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) states that, &quot;An advance fee scheme occurs when the victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value—such as a loan, contract, investment, or gift—and then receives little or nothing in return.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/advance-fee-schemes/|title=Advance Fee Scams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of this type of [[scam]], including the '''Nigerian prince scam''', also known as a '''419 scam'''. The number &quot;419&quot; refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud, the charges and penalties for offenders. The scam has been used with fax and traditional mail, and is now prevalent in online communications like [[emails]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1055378/Nigerian-scam|title=Nigerian scam|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations known to have a high incidence of advance-fee fraud include: [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=West African Advance Fee Scams.|url=http://abidjan.usembassy.gov/art_of_scam.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614014628/http://abidjan.usembassy.gov/art_of_scam.html|archivedate=June 14, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2012|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Togo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Togo_Embassy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Togo: Country Specific Information|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1041.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702001520/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1041.html|archive-date=2012-07-02|accessdate=June 23, 2012|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;South_Africa_Hampshire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Advance Fee Fraud.|url=http://www.hampshire.police.uk/Internet/advice/advice/advancefeefraud.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209110640/http://www.hampshire.police.uk/Internet/advice/advice/advancefeefraud.htm|archivedate=February 9, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2012|publisher=Hampshire Constabulary}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Netherlands&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraud Scheme Information.|url=http://amsterdam.usconsulate.gov/advance_fee_fraude.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213153900/http://amsterdam.usconsulate.gov/advance_fee_fraude.html|archivedate=February 13, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2012|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Advance Fee Fraud.|url=http://www.bba.org.uk/customer/article/advance-fee-fraud/fraud/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628152200/http://www.bba.org.uk/customer/article/advance-fee-fraud/fraud/|archivedate=June 28, 2012|accessdate=June 23, 2012|publisher=BBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Jak uniknąć &quot;oszustwa nigeryjskiego&quot;|url=http://www.wolsztyn.policja.gov.pl/w29/prewencja/porady/139469,Jak-uniknac-quotoszustwa-nigeryjskiegoquot.html|accessdate=April 16, 2019|publisher=Polska Policja|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackman|first1=Tom|date=February 12, 2019|title=William Webster, ex-FBI and CIA director, helps feds nab Jamaican phone scammer|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/william-webster-ex-fbi-and-cia-director-helps-feds-nab-jamaican-phone-scammer/ar-BBTt0GK|accessdate=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vasciannie|first1=Stephen|authorlink1=Stephen Vasciannie|date=14 March 2013|title=Jamaica Comes Down Tough on 'Lottery Scams'|work=[[Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ambassador-stephen-vasciannie/jamaica-lottery-scams_b_2875370.html|accessdate=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other variations include the [[Spanish Prisoner|Spanish Prisoner scam]], the [[black money scam]], Fifo's Fraud and the Detroit-Buffalo scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answersforthefamily.com/nigerian-419-email-scams/|title=Nigerian 419 Email Scams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern scam is similar to the [[Spanish Prisoner]] scam which dates back to the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1898/03/20/archives/an-old-swindle-revived-the-spanish-prisoner-and-buried-treasure.html|title=An old swindle revived; The &quot;Spanish Prisoner&quot; and Buried Treasure Bait Again Being Offered to Unwary Americans|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 March 1898|page=12|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Old Spanish Swindle Still Brings In New U.S. Dollars, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 2, 1960, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; In that con, businessmen were contacted by an individual allegedly trying to smuggle someone that is connected to a wealthy family out of a prison in Spain. In exchange for assistance, the scammer promised to share money with the victim in exchange for a small amount of money to bribe prison guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;SnopesNigerianScam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/nigeria.asp|first=David|last=Mikkelson|title=Nigerian Scam|work=[[Snopes]]|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One variant of the scam may date back to the 18th or 19th centuries, as a very similar letter, entitled &quot;The Letter from Jerusalem&quot;, is seen in the memoirs of [[Eugène François Vidocq]], a former French criminal and [[private investigator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidocq&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vidocq|first=Eugène François|title=Memoirs of Vidocq: Principal Agent of the French Police until 1827|year=1834|publisher=E.

Hart|location=Baltimore, Maryland|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=vidocq+jerusalem+letter&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant of the scam, dating back to circa 1830, appears very similar to what is passed via email today: &quot;Sir, you will doubtlessly be astonished to be receiving a letter from a person unknown to you, who is about to ask a favour from you...&quot;, and goes on to talk of a casket containing 16,000 francs in gold and the diamonds of a late marchioness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris_Misty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Misty|title=Nigerian email scams royally obvious for good reason, study says|url=https://o.canada.com/technology/nigerian-email-scams-royally-obvious-for-good-reason-study-says-3|accessdate=January 4, 2019|newspaper=The Province|date=June 21, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104152958/https://o.canada.com/technology/nigerian-email-scams-royally-obvious-for-good-reason-study-says-3 | archive-date=January 4, 2019 |via=[[Canada.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern day transnational scam can be traced back to Germany in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014086/1922-11-16/ed-1/seq-6/print/image_664x817_from_0%2C450_to_1469%2C2257/|title=Danielson And Putnam News: Danielson|work=[[The Bulletin (Norwich)|Norwich Bulletin]]|date=16 November 1922|page=6|accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became popular during the 1980s. There are many variants of the letters sent. One of these, sent via postal mail, was addressed to a woman's husband, and inquired about his health. It then asked what to do with profits from a $24.6 million investment, and ended with a telephone number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buse_Uwe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Buse|first=Uwe|title=Africa's City of Cyber Gangsters.|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/spam-scams-africa-s-city-of-cyber-gangsters-a-384317.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=November 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other official-looking letters were sent from a writer who said he was a director of the state-owned [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]]. He said he wanted to transfer $20 million to the recipient's bank account – money that was budgeted, but was never spent. In exchange for transferring the funds out of [[Nigeria]], the recipient would keep 30% of the total. To get the process started, the scammer asked for a few sheets of the company's letterhead, bank account numbers, and other personal information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lohr_Steve&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lohr|first=Steve|title='Nigerian Scam' Lures Companies.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/21/business/nigerian-scam-lures-companies.html|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;US State Department&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=International Financial Scams |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/scams.html |publisher=[[United States Department of State]], Bureau of Consular Affairs |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other variants have involved mention of a [[Nigerian traditional rulers|Nigerian prince]] or other member of a royal family seeking to transfer large sums of money out of the country—thus, these scams are sometimes called &quot;Nigerian Prince emails&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBB_NY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nigerian Prince: Old Scam, New Twist|url=https://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/get-consumer-help/articles/the-nigerian-prince-old-scam-new-twist/|publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Get smart on cybersecurity|url = https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/teach/smarton/security/|website = Mozilla|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of [[e-mail]] and [[email harvesting]] software significantly lowered the cost of sending scam letters by using the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews_Robert&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=Baiters Teach Scammers a Lesson.|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2006/08/71387|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stancliff_Dave&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Stancliff|first=Dave|title=As It Stands: Why Nigeria became the scam capital of the world|url=http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19948675|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=Times-Standard|date=February 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216115156/http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19948675|archive-date=2012-02-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they may originate in other nations as well. For example, in 2006, 61% of Internet criminals were traced to locations in the [[United States]], while 16% were traced to the [[United Kingdom]] and 6% to locations in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg_Eric&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Eric|date=March 31, 2007|title=U.S. Internet fraud at all-time high|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/31/MNGSCOVGGI1.DTL|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations known to have a high incidence of advance-fee fraud include [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt; [[Togo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Togo_Embassy&quot;/&gt; [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;South_Africa_Hampshire&quot;/&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Netherlands&quot;/&gt; and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBA&quot;/&gt;

One reason Nigeria may have been singled out is the apparently comical, almost ludicrous nature of the promise of West African riches from a Nigerian prince. According to Cormac Herley, a [[Microsoft]] researcher, &quot;By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible, the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herley_Cormac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Herley|first=Cormac|title=Why do Nigerian Scammers Say They are from Nigeria?|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167719/WhyFromNigeria.pdf|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Microsoft]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Nigeria has earned a reputation for being at the center of email scammers,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff Writer|title=Nigeria's anti graft police shuts 800 scam websites.|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iV7uw_rlEABbsQCt-GvZexDLbRqw|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number 419 refers to the article of the Nigerian Criminal Code (part of Chapter 38: &quot;Obtaining property by [[false pretenses]]; [[Cheating (law)|Cheating]]&quot;) dealing with fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nigerian_Criminal_Code&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria Laws: Part 6: Offences Relating to property and contracts.|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-Part%20VI%20%20to%20the%20end.htm|publisher= Nigeria Law|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They refer to their targets as ''Maga'' or ''Mugu'', [[slang]] developed from a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word meaning &quot;Easy Target or Fool&quot; and referring to gullible people in general. Some scammers have accomplices in the United States and abroad that move in to finish the deal once the initial contact has been made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon_Robyn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|title=I Will Eat Your Dollars.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/20/world/fg-scammers20|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
This scam usually begins with the perpetrator contacting the victim via [[email]], [[instant messaging]] or [[social media]] using a fake email address or a fake social media account and making an offer that would allegedly result in a large payoff for the victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;SnopesNigerianScam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;loriggio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loriggio|first1=Paola|title=Toronto woman loses $450,000 from life savings, sale of condo to online dating scam: police.|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/national/toronto+woman+loses+24450+2c000+from+life+savings+home/13125808/story.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=March 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084508/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/national/toronto+woman+loses+24450+2c000+from+life+savings+home/13125808/story.html|archive-date=March 24, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An email subject line may say something like &quot;From the desk of barrister &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Name&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, &quot;Your assistance is needed&quot;, and so on. The details vary, but the usual story is that a person, often a government or bank employee, knows of a large amount of unclaimed money or gold which they cannot access directly, usually because they have no right to it&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wild|first=Jonathan|title=Department of Internal Affairs: England and the Countryside|date=2017-02-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748635061.003.0006|work=Literature of the 1900s|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|doi=10.3366/edinburgh/9780748635061.003.0006|isbn=978-0-7486-3506-1|access-date=2020-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} 

Such people, who may be real but impersonated people or fictitious characters played by the [[con artist]], could include, for example, the wife or son of a deposed African leader who has amassed a stolen fortune, a bank employee who knows of a terminally ill wealthy person with no relatives, or a wealthy foreigner who deposited money in the bank just before dying in a plane crash (leaving no [[will (law)|will]] or known [[next of kin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/consumersmarts/archives/125509.asp |title=Latest e-mail uses Alaska Airlines crash victims to scam &amp;#124; Consumer News - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a US soldier who has stumbled upon a hidden cache of gold in Iraq, a business being audited by the government, a disgruntled worker or corrupt government official who has embezzled funds, a refugee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Zimbabwe appeal|url = http://www.scamnet.wa.gov.au/scamnet/Types_Of_Scams-Charity_Scams-Zimbabwe_appeal.htm|website = Department of Commerce - WA ScamNet|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar characters. 

The money could be in the form of [[gold as an investment|gold bullion]], gold dust, money in a bank account, [[blood diamond]]s, a series of checks or bank drafts, and so forth{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. The sums involved are usually in the millions of dollars, and the investor is promised a large share, typically ten to forty percent, in return for assisting the fraudster to retrieve or expatriate the money. Although the vast majority of recipients do not respond to these emails, a very small percentage do, enough to make the fraud worthwhile, as many millions of messages can be sent daily.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

To help persuade the victim to agree to the deal, the scammer often sends one or more false documents which bear official government [[rubber stamps|stamps]], and [[seal (device)|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longmore-Etheridge|first=Ann|title=Nigerian scam goes on|journal=Security Management|date=August 1996|volume=40|issue=8|page=109|id={{ProQuest|231127826}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 419 scammers often mention false addresses and use photographs taken from the Internet or from magazines to falsely represent themselves{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Often a photograph used by a scammer is not a picture of any person involved in the scheme. Multiple &quot;people&quot; may write or be involved in schemes as they continue, but they are often fictitious; in many cases, one person controls many fictitious personae all used in scams.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt;

Once the victim's confidence has been gained, the scammer then introduces a delay or monetary hurdle that prevents the deal from occurring as planned, such as &quot;To transmit the money, we need to bribe a bank official. Could you help us with a loan?&quot; or &quot;For you to be a party to the transaction, you must have holdings at a Nigerian bank of $100,000 or more&quot; or similar{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. This is the money being stolen from the victim; the victim willingly transfers the money, usually through some irreversible channel such as a [[wire transfer]], and the scammer receives and pockets it.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt;

More delays and additional costs are added, always keeping the promise of an imminent large transfer alive, convincing the victim that the money the victim is currently paying is covered several times over by the payoff{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. The implication that these payments will be used for &quot;white-collar&quot; crime such as bribery, and even that the money they are being promised is being stolen from a government or royal/wealthy family, often prevents the victim from telling others about the &quot;transaction&quot;, as it would involve admitting that they intended to be complicit in an international crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt;

Sometimes psychological pressure is added by claiming that the Nigerian side, to pay certain fees, had to sell belongings and borrow money on a house, or by comparing the salary scale and living conditions in Africa to those in the West{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Much of the time, however, the needed psychological pressure is self-applied; once the victims have provided money toward the payoff, they feel they have a vested interest in seeing the &quot;deal&quot; through. Some victims even believe they can cheat the other party, and walk away with all the money instead of just the percentage they were promised.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt;

The essential fact in all advance-fee fraud operations is the promised money transfer to the victim never happens, because the money does not exist. The perpetrators rely on the fact that, by the time the victim realizes this (often only after being confronted by a third party who has noticed the transactions or conversation and recognized the scam), the victim may have sent thousands of dollars of their own money, and sometimes thousands more that has been borrowed or stolen, to the scammer via an untraceable and/or irreversible means such as wire transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt; The scammer disappears, and the victim is left on the hook for the money sent to the scammer.

During the course of many schemes, scammers ask victims to supply bank account information. Usually this is a &quot;test&quot; devised by the scammer to gauge the victim's [[gullibility]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Netherlands&quot;/&gt; the bank account information isn't used directly by the scammer, because a fraudulent withdrawal from the account is more easily detected, reversed, and traced. Scammers instead usually request that payments be made using a wire transfer service like [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Advance Fee Loan Scams {{!}} DirectLendingSolutions.com®|url = https://www.directlendingsolutions.com/loan_scam.htm|website = www.directlendingsolutions.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given by the scammer usually relates to the speed at which the payment can be received and processed, allowing quick release of the supposed payoff. The real reason is that wire transfers and similar methods of payment are irreversible, untraceable and, because identification beyond knowledge of the details of the transaction is often not required, completely anonymous.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt; However, bank account information obtained by scammers is sometimes sold in bulk to other fraudsters, who wait a few months for the victim to repair the damage caused by the initial scam, before raiding any accounts which the victim didn't close.

Telephone numbers used by scammers tend to come from [[burner phones]]. In [[Ivory Coast]] a scammer may purchase an inexpensive mobile phone and a pre-paid SIM card without submitting any identifying information. If the scammers believe they are being traced, they discard their mobile phones and purchase new ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;usembassy&quot;/&gt;

The spam emails used in these scams are often sent from [[Internet café]]s equipped with satellite internet connection. Recipient addresses and email content are copied and pasted into a webmail interface using a stand-alone storage medium, such as a memory card{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Certain areas of [[Lagos]], such as [[Festac]], contain many cyber cafés that serve scammers; cyber cafés often seal their doors outside hours, such as from 10:30pm to 7:00am, so that scammers inside may work without fear of discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;eat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2005-10-29 |accessdate=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars |archivedate=October 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigeria also contains many businesses that provide false documents used in scams; after a scam involving a forged signature of Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in summer 2005, Nigerian authorities raided a market in the Oluwole section of Lagos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2005-10-29|title='I Will Eat Your Dollars' - Yahoo! News|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029165224/http://news.yahoo.com/s/latimests/20051020/ts_latimes/iwilleatyourdollars|access-date=2020-11-20|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police seized thousands of Nigerian and non-Nigerian passports, 10,000 blank [[British Airways]] boarding passes, 10,000 United States Postal [[money order]]s, customs documents, false university certificates, 500 printing plates, and 500 computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eat&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;success rate&quot; of the scammers is also hard to gauge, since they are operating illegally and do not keep track of specific numbers. One individual estimated he sent 500 emails per day and received about seven replies, citing that when he received a reply, he was 70 percent certain he would get the money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon_Robyn&quot;/&gt; If tens of thousands of emails are sent every day by thousands of individuals, it doesn't take a very high success rate to be worthwhile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grinker_Roy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Grinker, Roy R. |author2=Lubkemann, Stephen C. |author3=Steiner, Christopher B. |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-1-4443-3522-4|pages=618–621|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&amp;q=nigerian+scam+success+rate&amp;pg=PA621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, efforts have been made by governments, internet companies, and individuals to combat scammers involved in advance-fee fraud and 419 scams. In 2004, the Nigerian government formed the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) to combat economic and financial crimes, such as advanced fee fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act of 2004 |url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |publisher=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Nigeria) |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628080831/http://www.efccnigeria.org/efcc_homepage_files/establishment_act_2004.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Nigeria's EFCC announced that they have adopted smart technology developed by [[Microsoft]] to track down fraudulent emails. They hoped to have the service, dubbed &quot;Eagle Claw&quot;, running at full capacity to warn a quarter of a million potential victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP_2009&quot;/&gt;

Some individuals participate in a practice known as [[scam baiting]], in which they pose as potential targets and engage the scammers in lengthy dialogue so as to waste the scammer's time and decrease the time they have available for real victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheng_Jacqui&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit).|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/05/baiting-nigerian-scammers-for-fun-not-so-much-for-profit/|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
===Irreversible money transfers===
A central element of advance-fee fraud is the transaction from the victim to the scammer must be untraceable and irreversible. Otherwise, the victim, once they become aware of the scam, can successfully retrieve their money and alert officials who can track the accounts used by the scammer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Wire transfers via [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]] are ideal for this purpose. International wire transfers cannot be cancelled or reversed, and the person receiving the money cannot be tracked. Other non-cancellable forms of payment include postal money orders and cashier's checks, but wire transfer via Western Union or MoneyGram is more common. [[Cryptocurrency]] payments are also used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Anonymous communication===
Since the scammer's operations must be untraceable to avoid identification, and because the scammer is often impersonating someone else, any communication between the scammer and his victim must be done through channels that hide the scammer's true identity{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. The following options in particular are widely used.

====Web-based email====
Because many free email services do not require valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. Some services go so far as to mask the sender's source IP address ([[Gmail]] being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to the country of origin. While Gmail does indeed strip headers from emails, it is, in fact, possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====Email hijacking/friend scams====
Some fraudsters hijack existing email accounts and use them for advance-fee fraud purposes. The fraudster impersonates associates, friends, or family members of the legitimate account owner in an attempt to defraud them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=David F.|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/e-mail-scammers-ask-your-friends-for-money/index.html?ex=1352264400&amp;en=597277d1a0cbde58&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=E-Mail Scammers Ask Your Friends for Money|publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of techniques such as [[phishing]], [[Keystroke logging|keyloggers]], and [[computer virus]]es are used to gain login information for the email address.

====Fax transmissions====
[[Fax|Facsimile machines]] are commonly used tools of business, whenever a client requires a hard copy of a document.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} They can also be simulated using web services, and made untraceable by the use of prepaid phones connected to mobile fax machines or by use of a public fax machine such as one owned by a document processing business like [[FedEx Office|FedEx Office/Kinko's]]. Thus, scammers posing as business entities often use fax transmissions as an anonymous form of communication. This is more expensive, as the prepaid phone and fax equipment cost more than email, but to a skeptical victim, it can be more believable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====SMS messages====
Abusing [[Short Message Service|SMS]] bulk senders such as [[Wireless Application Service Provider|WASPs]], scammers subscribe to these services using fraudulent registration details and paying either via cash or stolen credit card details{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}. They then send out masses of unsolicited SMSes to victims stating they have won a competition, lottery, reward, or an event, and they have to contact somebody to claim their prize. Typically the details of the party to be contacted will be an equally untraceable email address or a [[virtual telephone number]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} 

These messages may be sent over a weekend when the staff at the service providers are not working, enabling the scammer to be able to abuse the services for a whole weekend. Even when traceable, they give out long and winding procedures for procuring the reward (real or unreal) and that too with the impending huge cost of transportation and tax or duty charges. The origin of such SMS messages is often from fake websites/addresses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

A recent (mid-2011) innovation is the use of a Premium Rate 'call back' number (instead of a website or email) in the SMS. On calling the number, the victim is first reassured that 'they are a winner' and then subjected to a long series of instructions on how to collect their 'winnings'. During the message, there will be frequent instructions to 'ring back in the event of problems'. The call is always 'cut off' just before the victim has the chance to note all the details. Some victims call back multiple times in an effort to collect all the details. The scammer thus makes their money out of the fees charged for the calls.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====Telecommunications relay services====
Many scams use telephone calls to convince the victim that the person on the other end of the deal is a real, truthful person. The scammer, possibly impersonating a person of a nationality, or gender, other than their own, would arouse suspicion by telephoning the victim. In these cases, scammers use [[Telecommunications Relay Service|TRS]], a US federally funded relay service where an operator or a text/speech translation program acts as an intermediary between someone using an ordinary telephone and a deaf caller using [[telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD]] or other [[teleprinter]] device. The scammer may claim they are deaf, and that they must use a relay service. The victim, possibly drawn in by sympathy for a disabled caller, might be more susceptible to the fraud.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}FCC regulations and confidentiality laws require operators to relay calls verbatim and adhere to a strict code of confidentiality and ethics. Thus, no relay operator may judge the legality and legitimacy of a relay call and must relay it without interference. This means the relay operator may not warn victims, even when they suspect the call is a scam. [[MCI Inc.|MCI]] said about one percent of their IP Relay calls in 2004 were scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/4781806|title=Con artists target phone system for deaf|publisher=MSNBC|date=2004-04-20|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking phone-based relay services is relatively easy, so scammers tend to prefer Internet Protocol-based relay services such as [[IP Relay]]. In a common strategy, they bind their overseas IP address to a router or server located on US soil, allowing them to use US-based relay service providers without interference.

TRS is sometimes used to relay credit card information to make a fraudulent purchase with a stolen credit card. In many cases however, it is simply a means for the con artist to further lure the victim into the scam.

===Invitation to visit the country===
Sometimes, victims are invited to a country to meet government officials, an associate of the scammer, or the scammer themselves. Some victims who travel are instead held for ransom. Scammers may tell a victim that they do not need  a [[visa (document)|visa]], or that the scammers will provide one.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDeptPub10465&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/2189.pdf |author=United States Department of State |title=Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud (DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 10465) |date=April 1997 |access-date=January 4, 2019 |publisher=State Dept. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the victim does this, the scammers have the power to extort money from the victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDeptPub10465&quot;/&gt; 

Sometimes victims are ransomed, [[kidnap]]ped or murdered. According to a 1995 U.S. State Department report, over fifteen persons were murdered between 1992 and 1995 in Nigeria after following through on advance-fee frauds.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDeptPub10465&quot;/&gt; In 1999 Norwegian millionaire Kjetil Moe was lured to South Africa by 419 scammers, and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8587&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=26 Kjetil Moe found dead].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25269|title=The 419 Scam, or Why a Nigerian Prince Wants to Give You Two Million Dollars|work=informit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Makronalli was lured to South Africa and killed in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;News24murder&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/SA-cops-Interpol-probe-murder-20041231|publisher=News24|title=SA cops, Interpol probe murder|author =Philip de Braun|date=2004-12-31|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebies.about.com/library/weekly/aa110302a.htm|title=Scam Bait - Don't let greed get you scammed|publisher=Freebies.about.com|date=2010-06-17|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
{{see also|Internet fraud|List of email scams|phishing}}
There are many variations on the most common stories, and also many variations on the way the scam works. Some of the more commonly seen variants involve [[employment scams]], [[lottery scam]]s, online sales and rentals, and [[romance scam]]s. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]], or property rental. This article cannot list every known and future type of advanced fee fraud or 419 scheme; only some major types are described. Additional examples may be available in the ''[[#External links|external links]]'' section at the end of this article.

===Employment scams===
This scam targets people who have posted their résumés on e.g. job sites. The scammer sends a letter with a falsified company logo. The job offer usually indicates exceptional salary and benefits, and requests that the victim needs a &quot;work permit&quot; for working in the country, and includes the address of a (fake) &quot;government official&quot; to contact. The &quot;government official&quot; then proceeds to fleece the victim by extracting fees from the unsuspecting user for the work permit and other fees. A variant of the job scam recruits freelancers seeking work, such as editing or translation, then requires some advance payment before assignments are offered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

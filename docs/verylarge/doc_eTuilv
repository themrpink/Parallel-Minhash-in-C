Maria Theresa was not just critical of Marie Antoinette. She disliked Leopold's reserve and often blamed him for being cold. She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor [[French language|French]] and haughtiness. The only child she did not constantly scold was Maria Christina, who enjoyed her mother's complete confidence, though she failed to please her mother in one aspect – she did not produce any surviving children.{{sfn|Beales|1987|p=194}}

One of Maria Theresa's greatest wishes was to have as many grandchildren as possible, but she had only about two dozen at the time of her death, of which all the eldest surviving daughters were named after her, with the exception of [[Princess Carolina of Parma]], her eldest granddaughter by Maria Amalia.{{sfn|Beales|1987|p=194}}{{efn|The eldest surviving daughters of Maria Theresa's children were [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1762–1770)|Maria Theresa of Austria]] (by Joseph), [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1767–1827)|Maria Theresa of Tuscany]] (by Leopold), [[Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily]] (by Maria Carolina), [[Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1773–1832)|Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]] (by Ferdinand) and [[Marie Thérèse of France]] (by Marie Antoinette).}}

''Peace'' holds the [[olive branch|olive crown]] above her head, reaffirming Maria Theresa's monarchical status. This was the last commissioned state portrait of Maria Theresa.{{sfn|Yonan|2003|p=116-7}}]]

Emperor Francis died on 18 August 1765, while he and the court were in [[Innsbruck]] celebrating the wedding of his second son, Leopold. Maria Theresa was devastated. Their eldest son, Joseph, became Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Theresa abandoned all ornamentation, had her hair cut short, painted her rooms black and dressed in mourning for the rest of her life. She completely withdrew from court life, public events, and theater. Throughout her widowhood, she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber, which negatively affected her mental health.{{sfn|Yonan|2003|p=112}} She described her state of mind shortly after Francis's death: &quot;I hardly know myself now, for I have become like an animal with no true life or reasoning power.&quot;{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|p=267}}

Upon his accession to the imperial throne, Joseph ruled less land than his father had in 1740, since he had given up his rights over Tuscany to Leopold, and thus he only controlled [[Falkenstein, Rhineland-Palatinate|Falkenstein]] and [[Duchy of Teschen|Teschen]]. Believing that the emperor must possess enough land to maintain his standing as emperor,{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=194}} Maria Theresa, who was used to being assisted in the administration of her vast realms, declared Joseph to be her new co-ruler on 17 September 1765.{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=192}} From then on, mother and son had frequent ideological disagreements. The 22&amp;nbsp;million gulden that Joseph inherited from his father was injected into the treasury. Maria Theresa had another loss in February 1766 when Haugwitz died. She gave her son absolute control over the military following the death of [[Leopold Joseph von Daun]].{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|pp=268, 271}}

According to Austrian historian Robert A. Kann, Maria Theresa was a monarch of above-average qualifications but intellectually inferior to Joseph and Leopold. Kann asserts that she nevertheless possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, she was ready to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.{{sfn|Kann|1980|p=157}}
&lt;!---{{quote box|align=left|width=20em|She never bothers about her health, but relies entirely upon her vigorous body for strength and endurance. She is warm-blooded and, even in the middle of winter, often sits by an open window ... Her physician scolds her dreadfully about this, but she only laughs at him.|Prussian ambassador's letter to [[Frederick the Great]], c. 1748{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=230}}''}}---&gt;

The relationship between Maria Theresa and Joseph was not without warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed. Despite his intellect, Maria Theresa's force of personality often made Joseph cower.{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=182}} Sometimes, she openly admired his talents and achievements, but she was also not hesitant to rebuke him. She even wrote: &quot;We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... I just try to avoid public scandal.&quot;{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=183}} In another letter, also addressed to Joseph's companion, she complained: &quot;He avoids me ... I am the only person in his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ... Abdication alone can remedy matters.&quot;{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=183}} After much contemplation, she chose not to abdicate. Joseph himself often threatened to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 was a sign that God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.{{sfn|Beales|2005|p=185}}

Joseph and Prince Kaunitz arranged the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] despite Maria Theresa's protestations. Her sense of justice pushed her to reject the idea of partition, which would hurt the [[Polish people]].{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=194}} She even once argued, &quot;What right have we to rob an innocent nation that it has hitherto been our boast to protect and support?&quot;{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|p=285}} The duo argued that it was too late to abort now. Besides, Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and [[Catherine II of Russia]] would do it with or without Austrian participation. Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took [[Galicia and Lodomeria]]; in the words of Frederick, &quot;the more she cried, the more she took&quot;.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=195}}

A few years after the partition, Russia defeated the Ottoman Empire in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] in 1774 that concluded the war, Austria entered into negotiations with the [[Sublime Porte]]. Thus, in 1775, the Ottoman Empire ceded the northwestern part of [[Moldavia]] (subsequently known as [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]]) to Austria.{{sfn|Vocelka|2009|p=154}} Subsequently, on 30 December 1777, [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]] died without leaving any children.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=195}} As a result, his territories were coveted by ambitious men, including Joseph, who tried to swap Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands.{{sfn|Beller|2006|p=94}} This alarmed Frederick II of Prussia, and thus the [[War of Bavarian Succession]] erupted in 1778. Maria Theresa very unwillingly consented to the occupation of Bavaria, and a year later she made peace proposals to Frederick II despite Joseph's objections.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=196}} Although Austria managed to gain the [[Innviertel]] area, this &quot;Potato War&quot; caused a setback to the financial improvement that the Habsburg had made.{{sfn|Beller|2006|p=94}} The 500,000 gulden in annual revenue from 100,000 inhabitants of Innviertel were not comparable to the 100,000,000 gulden that were spent during the war.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=196}}

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Kaisergruft 2286201074 fdea9c4cfa b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Maria Theresa and her husband are interred in the double tomb which she had inscribed as a widow.]]
It is unlikely that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the [[smallpox]] attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from [[shortness of breath]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[cough]], distress, [[necrophobia]] and [[insomnia]]. She later developed [[edema]].{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=334}}

Maria Theresa fell ill on 24 November 1780. Her physician Dr. Störk thought her condition serious, although Joseph was confident that she would recover in no time. By 26 November, she asked for the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|last rites]], and on 28 November, the doctor told her that the time had come. On 29 November, she died surrounded by her remaining children.{{sfn|Crankshaw|1970|pp=336–8}}{{sfn|Goldsmith|1936|p=272}} Her longtime rival [[Frederick the Great]], on hearing of her death, said that she had honored her throne and her sex, and though he had fought against her in three wars, he never considered her his enemy.{{sfn|Mitford|1970|p=287}} With her death, the [[House of Habsburg]] died out and was replaced by the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]. Joseph, already co-sovereign of the Habsburg dominions, succeeded her, and introduced sweeping reforms in the empire; Joseph II produced nearly 700 edicts per year (or almost two per day), whereas Maria Theresa only issued about 100 edicts annually.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=197}}

Maria Theresa understood the importance of her public ''persona'' and was able to simultaneously evoke both esteem and affection from her subjects; a notable example was how she projected dignity and simplicity to awe the people in Pressburg before she was crowned as the Queen of Hungary.{{sfn|Browning|1994|p=67}} Her 40-year reign was considered to be very successful when compared to other Habsburg rulers. Her reforms had transformed the empire into a modern state with a significant international standing.{{sfn|Yonan|2011|p=3}} She centralised and modernised the institutions, and her reign was considered as the beginning of the era of &quot;[[enlightened absolutism]]&quot; in Austria, with a brand new approach towards governing: the measures undertaken by rulers became more modern and rational, and thoughts were given to the welfare of the state and the people.{{sfn|Vocelka|2009|p=154-155}} Many of her policies were not in line with the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (such as her support of [[torture]]), and she was still very much influenced by Catholicism from the previous era.{{sfn|Vocelka|2009|p=156}} Vocelka even stated that &quot;taken as a whole the reforms of Maria Theresa appear more absolutist and centralist than enlightened, even if one must admit that the influence of enlightened ideas is visible to a certain degree.&quot;{{sfn|Vocelka|2000|p=202}}

Her body is buried in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna|Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna next to her husband in a coffin she had inscribed during her lifetime.{{sfn|Mahan|1932|p=335}}

'''Lycia''' ([[Lycian language|Lycian]]: 𐊗𐊕𐊐𐊎𐊆𐊖 ''Trm̃mis''; {{lang-el|Λυκία}}, {{Lang|el-Latn|Likia}}; {{lang-tr|Likya}}) was a geopolitical region in [[Anatolia]] in what are now the [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]] of [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] and [[Muğla Province|Muğla]] on the southern [[coast]] of [[Turkey]], bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[Burdur Province]] inland. Known to history since the records of [[ancient Egypt]] and the [[Hittite Empire]] in the [[Late Bronze Age]], it was populated by speakers of the [[Luwian language]] group. Written records began to be inscribed in stone in the [[Lycian language]] (a later form of Luwian) after Lycia's involuntary incorporation into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the [[Iron Age]]. At that time (546&amp;nbsp;BC) the Luwian speakers were decimated, and Lycia received an influx of Persian speakers. Ancient sources seem to indicate that an older name of the region was '''Alope''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλόπη|}}, {{Lang|grc-Latn|Alópē}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pauly|I,2|1595|1596|Alope 5|[[Johannes Toepffer]]|RE:Alope 5|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lycia fought for the Persians in the [[Persian Wars]], but on the defeat of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by the Greeks, it became intermittently a free agent. After a brief membership in the [[Athenian Empire]], it seceded and became independent (its treaty with Athens had omitted the usual non-secession clause), was under the Persians again, revolted again, was conquered by [[Mausolus]] of [[Caria]], returned to the Persians, and finally fell under [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] [[hegemony]] upon the defeat of the Persians by [[Alexander the Great]]. Due to the influx of Greek speakers and the sparsity of the remaining Lycian speakers, Lycia was rapidly [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] under the Macedonians, and the Lycian language disappeared from inscriptions and coinage.

On defeating [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 188 BC, the [[Roman Republic]] gave Lycia to [[Rhodes]] for 20&amp;nbsp;years, taking it back in 168&amp;nbsp;BC. In these latter stages of the Roman Republic, Lycia came to enjoy freedom as a Roman [[protectorate]]. The Romans validated [[home rule]] officially under the Lycian League in 168&amp;nbsp;BC. This native government was an early [[federation]] with republican principles; these later came to the attention of the framers of the [[United States Constitution]], influencing their thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 September 2005 |first=Richard |last=Bernstein |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Congress, Buried in Turkey's Sand |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120905123826/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/international/europe/19patara.html?_r=1 |archive-date=5 September 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/international/europe/19patara.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite home rule, Lycia was not a sovereign state and had not been since its defeat by the [[Carians]]. In 43&amp;nbsp;AD the Roman emperor [[Claudius]] dissolved the league, and Lycia was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] with provincial status. It became an [[eparchy]] of the Eastern, or [[Byzantine Empire]], continuing to speak Greek even after being joined by communities of [[Turkish language]] speakers in the early 2nd millennium. After the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine Empire]] in the 15th century, Lycia was under the [[Ottoman Empire]], and was inherited by the [[Turkish Republic]] on the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greek and Turkish population was exchanged]] when the [[Greece–Turkey border]] was negotiated in 1923.

==Geography==
[[File:Reconstruction_Nereid_Monument_BM.jpg|thumb|Partial reconstruction of the Nereid Monument at [[Xanthos]] in Lycia, c. 390–380 BC.]]

The borders of Lycia varied over time, but at its centre was the [[Teke peninsula]] of southwestern Turkey, which juts southward into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], bounded on the west by the [[Gulf of Fethiye]], and on the east by the [[Gulf of Antalya]]. Lycia comprised what is now the westernmost portion of [[Antalya]] Province, the easternmost portion of [[Muğla Province]], and the southernmost portion of [[Burdur]] Province. In ancient times the surrounding districts were, from west to east, [[Caria]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Pamphylia]], all equally as ancient, and each speaking its own [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian language]].

The name of the Teke Peninsula comes from the former name of Antalya Province, which was [[Teke Province]], named from the Turkish tribe that settled in the region.

===Physical geography===
Four ridges extend from northeast to southwest, roughly, forming the western extremity of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. Furthest west of the four are Boncuk Dağlari, or 'the Boncuk Mountains', extending from about [[Altinyayla, Burdur]], southwest to about Oren north of [[Fethiye]]. This is a fairly low range peaking at about {{convert|2340|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To the west of it the steep gorges of Dalaman Çayi ('the Dalaman River'), the ancient Indus, formed the traditional border between Caria and Lycia. The stream, {{convert|229|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, enters the Mediterranean to the west of modern-day [[Dalaman]]. Upstream it is dammed in four places, after an origin in the vicinity of Sarikavak in [[Denizli]] Province.

[[File:Xanthos inschriftenpfeiler axb01.jpg|thumb|Inscribed [[Xanthian Obelisk]] (c. 400 BC), a funerary pillar for a sarcophagus that probably belonged to Dynast [[Kheriga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=Antony G. |title=Dynastic Lycia: A Political of History of the Lycians and Their Relations with Foreign Powers : C. 545-362 B.C. |date=1998 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004109560 |page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ig4KJySudYC&amp;pg=PA130 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The next ridge to the east is Akdağlari, 'the White Mountains', about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a high point at Uyluktepe, &quot;Uyluk Peak,&quot; of {{convert|3024|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This massif may have been ancient Mount Cragus. Along its western side flows Eşen Çayi, &quot;the Esen River,&quot; anciently the [[Xanthos]], Lycian Arñna, originating in the Boncuk Mountains, flowing south, and transecting the several-mile-long beach at [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]]. The Xanthos Valley was the country called Tŗmmis in dynastic Lycia, from which the people were the Termilae or Tremilae, or Kragos in the coin inscriptions of Greek Lycia: Kr or Ksan Kr. The name of western Lycia was given by [[Charles Fellows]] to it and points of Lycia west of it.

The next ridge to the east, Beydağlari, 'the Bey Mountains', peaks at Kizlarsevrisi, {{convert|3086|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the highest point of the Teke Peninsula. It is most likely the ancient Masicytus range. Between Beydağlari and Akdağlari is an upland plateau, Elmali, where ancient Milyas was located. The elevation of the town of Elmali, which means 'Apple Town,' from the density of fruit-bearing groves in the region, is {{convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which is the highest part of the valley below it. Fellows considered the valley to be central Lycia.

The Akçay, or 'White River', the ancient Aedesa, brought water from the slopes to the plain, where it pooled in two lakes below the town, Karagöl and Avlangöl. Currently the two lakes are dry, the waters being captured on an ongoing basis by irrigation systems for the trees. The Aedesa once drained the plain through a chasm to the east, but now flows entirely through pipelines covering the same route, but emptying into the water supplies of Arycanda and Arif. An effort has been made to restore some of the cedar forests cleared in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mountain and plain: from the Lycian coast to the Phrygian plateau in the late Roman and early Byzantine period | first1=Martin | last1=Harrison | first2=Wendy | last2=Young | location=Ann Arbor | publisher=The University of Michigan Press | year=2001 | pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The easternmost ridge extends along the east coast of the Teke Peninsula, and is called, generally, Tahtali Dağlari, &quot;The Tahtali Mountains.&quot; The high point within them is Tahtali Dağ, elevation {{convert|2366|m|ft|abbr=on}}, dubbed &quot;Mount Olympus&quot; in antiquity by the Greeks, remembering [[Mount Olympus]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tahtali Dagi (2366 m.) |work=Antalya Website |date=1996–2011 |publisher=antalyaonline.net |url=http://www.antalya-ws.com/english/mountain/tahtali.asp |access-date=21 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825212131/http://www.antalya-ws.com/english/mountain/tahtali.asp |archive-date=25 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains create a rugged coastline called by Fellows eastern Lycia. Much of it has been reserved as Olimpos Beydağlari Parki. Within the park on the slopes of Mount Olympus is a U-shaped outcrop, [[Yanartaş]], above [[Cirali]], from which [[methane]] gas, naturally perpetually escaping from below through the rocks, feeds eternal flames. This is the location of ancient [[Mount Chimaera]].

Through the [[cul-de-sac]] between Baydağlari and Tahtalidağlari, the Alakir Çay ('Alakir River'), the ancient Limyra, flows to the south trickling from the broad valley under superhighway D400 near downtown [[Kumluca]] across a barrier beach into the Mediterranean. This configuration is entirely modern. Upstream the river is impounded behind Alakir Dam to form an urban-size reservoir. Below the reservoir a braided stream alternates with a single, small channel flowing through irrigated land. The wide bed gives an indication of the former size of the river. Upstream from the reservoir the stream lies in an unaltered gorge, flowing from the slopes of Baydağlari. The ancient route to Antalya goes up the valley and over the cul-de-sac, as the coast itself is impassible except by boat. The valley was the seat of ancient Solymus, home of the Solymi.

===Demography===
The ancient sources mention about 70 settlements of Lycia. These are situated either along the coastal strip in the protecting coves or on the slopes and hills of the mountain ranges. They are often difficult to access, which in ancient times was a defensive feature. The rugged coastline favored well-defended ports from which, in troubled times, Lycian pirate fleets sallied forth.

The principal cities of ancient Lycia were [[Xanthos]], [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], [[Myra]], [[Pinara]], [[Tlos]] and [[Olympos (Lycia)|Olympos]] (each entitled to three votes in the Lycian League) and [[Phaselis]]. Cities such as [[Telmessos]] and [[Krya]] were sometimes listed by Classical authors as Carian and sometimes as Lycian.

Although the 2nd-century BC dialogue ''[[Erōtes (Lucian)|Erōtes]]'' found the cities of Lycia &quot;interesting more for their history than for their monuments, since they have retained none of their former splendor,&quot; many relics of the [[Lycians]] remain visible today. These relics include the distinctive [[rock-cut tombs]] in the sides of cliffs. The [[British Museum]] in [[London]] grabbed one of the best collections of Lycian artifacts. [[Letoon]], an important center in Hellenic times of worship for the goddess [[Leto]] and her twin children, [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], and nearby Xanthos, ancient capital of Lycia, constitute a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/484/ |title=Xanthos-Letoon |work= World Heritage – The List|publisher= UNESCO|access-date= 13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's first [[Waymarking#Waymarking signage|waymarked]] long-distance footpath, the [[Lycian Way]], follows part of the coast of the region. The establishment of the path was a private initiative by a British/Turkish woman called Kate Clow. It is intended to support sustainable tourism in smaller mountain villages which are in the process of depopulation. Since it is mainly walked in March – June and Sept–Nov, it also has lengthened the tourism season. The Turkish Culture and Tourism Ministry promotes the Lycian coast as part of the [[Turkish Riviera]] or the Turquoise Coast, but the most important part of this is further west near Bodrum. This coast features rocky or sandy beaches at the bases of cliffs and settlements in protected coves that cater to the yachting industry.

The eponymous inhabitants of Lycia, the [[Lycians]], spoke Lycian, a member of the [[Luwian]] branch of the [[Anatolian languages]], a subfamily of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family. Lycian has been attested only between about 500&amp;nbsp;BC and no later than 300&amp;nbsp;BC, in a [[Lycian alphabet|unique alphabet]] devised for the purpose from the Greek alphabet of Rhodes. However, the Luwian languages originated in Anatolia during the 2nd millennium BC. The country was known by the name of Lukka then, and was under Hittite rule. The gap must be a gap in the use of writing.

At about 535&amp;nbsp;BC, before the first appearance of attested Lycian, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] overran Lycia. Despite its resistance, because of which the population of Xanthos was decimated, Lycia became part of the Persian Empire. The first coins with Lycian letters on them appeared not long before 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keen|1998|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lycia prospered under a monarchy set up by the Persians. Subsequently, the Lycians were verbose in stone, carving memorial, historical and governmental inscriptions. Not all of these can yet be entirely understood, due to remaining ignorance of the language. The term &quot;dynastic period&quot; is used. If the government was any sort of federal democracy, there is no evidence of it, as the term &quot;dynastic&quot; suggests.

Lycia already had been hosting a small enclave of the Dorian Greeks as Doris for some centuries. [[Rhodes]] also was Dorian. After the defeat of the Persians by the Greeks, Lycia became open to further Greek settlement. Inscriptions in Lycian diminished, while those in Greek multiplied. Complete assimilation to Greek occurred in the 4th century, after Lycia had come under Alexander the Great and his fellow Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keen|1998|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no agreement yet on which Lycian inscription is the very last. No date is later than 300 at the very latest.

Subsequently, the Lycians were defeated by the [[Roman Republic]], which for most of its final tenure allowed home rule to the Lycians, including their own language, then Greek. Lycia continued under the single empire, and fell naturally into the eastern empire when the division occurred. It was still speaking the Greek of the times when the eastern empire became the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the 2nd millennium Anatolia was infiltrated by Turkish speaking settlers, but they never were very numerous in Lycia. After the fall of the Byzantines in the 15th century, Lycia was under the Ottoman Empire. Turkish and Greek settlements existed side-by-side, each speaking their own language.

All Greek-speaking enclaves in Anatolia were exchanged for Turkish speakers in Greece during the final settlement of the border with Greece at the beginning of the Turkish Republic in 1923. The Turks had won wars with Greece and Armenia in the preceding few years, settling the issue of whether the coast of Anatolia was going to be Greek or Turkish. The intent of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] was to define borders that would not leave substantial populations of one country in another. Some population transfers were enforced. Former Greek villages still stand as ghost towns in Lycia.

==History==
===Proto-history===
Lycia had a [[proto-history]] little suspected by the historians of the 19th century before the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]], and the discovery of government records pertaining to Lycia and the Lycians. The records for the most part do not offer positive reports of them. In reports of official transactions with Lycians in the late Bronze Age, the Hittite and Egyptian empires described them as rebels, pirates, and raiders. The Lycians have left no written records of themselves at all from this period, which suggests that they probably were illiterate.

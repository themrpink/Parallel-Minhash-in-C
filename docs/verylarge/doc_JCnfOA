==Personal life==
[[File:Duke Ellington 1.JPG|thumb|left|Ellington in 1973]]
Ellington married his high school sweetheart, Edna Thompson (d. 1967), on July 2, 1918, when he was 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;hasse49&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next spring, on March 11, 1919, Edna gave birth to their only son, [[Mercer Ellington|Mercer Kennedy Ellington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hasse49&quot; /&gt;

Ellington was joined in New York City by his wife and son in the late twenties, but the couple soon permanently separated.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Robinson, [https://archive.is/20101029213611/http://gibbsmagazine.com/Duke%20Ellington.htm &quot;Duke Ellington&quot;], ''Gibbs'' magazine, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her obituary in ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine, she was &quot;homesick for Washington&quot; and returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchess&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Duke Ellington's Duchess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate= October 13, 2018|date= February 2, 1967 |publisher=Jet |pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Ellington became the companion of [[Mildred Dixon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=129-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; who traveled with him, managed Tempo Music, inspired songs, such as &quot;[[Sophisticated Lady]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Africville Genealogy Society|2010|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the peak of his career, and raised his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Africville Genealogy Society|2010|p=33-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen297&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|2010|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Mildred Dixon - Duke Ellington's wife.jpg|thumb|Mercer referred to [[Mildred Dixon]] as his mother.]]

In 1938 he left his family (his son was 19) and moved in with Beatrice &quot;Evie&quot; Ellis, a Cotton Club employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship, though stormy, continued after Ellington met and formed a relationship with Fernanda de Castro Monte in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Teachout|2015|p=310-312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellington supported both women &lt;!--which? three have been named --&gt;for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, 2001, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellington's sister Ruth (1915–2004) later ran Tempo Music, his music publishing company.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen297&quot; /&gt; Ruth's second husband was the bass-baritone [[McHenry Boatwright]], whom she met when he sang at her brother's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norment&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Norment|first=Lynn|title=McHenry-Boatwright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=October 13, 2018|date=January 1983|publisher=Ebony|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, son Mercer Ellington (d. 1996) played trumpet and piano, led his own band, and worked as his father's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mercer-ellington-mn0000405957/biography |title=Mercer Ellington: Biography |last=Yanow |first=Scott |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ellington died on May 24, 1974, of complications from lung cancer and [[pneumonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jones|first=Jack|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-duke-ellington-19740525-story.html|title=From the Archives: Jazz Great Duke Ellington Dies in New York Hospital at 75|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 25, 1974|access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few weeks after his 75th birthday.

==Legacy==
===Memorials===
Numerous memorials have been dedicated to Duke Ellington, in cities from New York and Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles. 

In Ellington's birthplace, Washington, D.C., the [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] educates talented students, who are considering careers in the arts, by providing intensive arts instruction and strong academic programs that prepare students for post-secondary education and professional careers. Originally built in 1935, the Calvert Street Bridge was renamed the [[Duke Ellington Bridge]] in 1974. Another school is P.S. 004 Duke Ellington in New York.

In 1989, a bronze plaque was attached to the newly named Duke Ellington Building at 2121 Ward Place, NW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Program and Invitation entitled &quot;the Dedication of the Birth Site of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington&quot; at 2129 Ward Place, N.W., Washington, D.C., April 29, 1989|url=http://www.aladin0.wrlc.org/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=q-01000-00---off-0grant--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10-KEY%2cSU%2cCO%2cPE--4--ward%2c%2c%2c-----0-1l--11-en-50---20-home-%5bward%5d%3aKEY+--01-3-1-00-0-0-11-0-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=grant&amp;srp=0&amp;srn=0&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HASH0194ab871aee7f616ed57be6|publisher=Felix E.

In 2010 the triangular park, across the street from Duke Ellington's birth site, at the intersection of New Hampshire and M Streets, NW was named the Duke Ellington Park.

In 1986 a United States commemorative stamp was issued featuring Ellington's likeness.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRAMMYs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/duke-ellington |title=Duke Ellington - Artist - www.grammy.com |publisher=Recording Academy |accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=May 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 DC Proof.png|thumb|Ellington on the Washington, D.C. quarter released in 2009.]]

Ellington lived out his final years in Manhattan, in a townhouse at 333 [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] near West 106th Street. His sister Ruth, who managed his publishing company, also lived there, and his son Mercer lived next door. After his death, West 106th Street was officially renamed Duke Ellington Boulevard.

A large memorial to Ellington, created by sculptor [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]], was dedicated in 1997 in New York's [[Central Park]], near [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]], an intersection named [[Duke Ellington Circle]].

A statue of Ellington at a piano is featured at the entrance to [[UCLA]]'s Schoenberg Hall. According to ''UCLA'' magazine:

{{quote|When UCLA students were entranced by Duke Ellington's provocative tunes at a [[Culver City]] club in 1937, they asked the budding musical great to play a free concert in [[Royce Hall]]. 'I've been waiting for someone to ask us!' Ellington exclaimed.

On the day of the concert, Ellington accidentally mixed up the venues and drove to USC instead. He eventually arrived at the UCLA campus and, to apologize for his tardiness, played to the packed crowd for more than four hours. And so, &quot;Sir Duke&quot; and his group played the first-ever jazz performance in a concert venue.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Parmer, [http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/depts/happenings/two_days_of_the_duke/ &quot;Curtain Up: Two Days of the Duke&quot;], ''UCLA Magazine'', April 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival]] is a nationally renowned annual competition for prestigious high school bands. Started in 1996 at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]], the festival is named after Ellington because of the large focus that the festival places on his works.

===Tributes===
After Duke died, his son Mercer took over leadership of the orchestra, continuing until his own death in 1996. Like the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], this &quot;ghost band&quot; continued to release albums for many years. ''[[Digital Duke]]'', credited to The Duke Ellington Orchestra, won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]]. Mercer Ellington had been handling all administrative aspects of his father's business for several decades. Mercer's children continue a connection with their grandfather's work.

[[Gunther Schuller]] wrote in 1989:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ellington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, Gunther, ''The Swing Era'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-504312-X}}, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martin Williams (writer)|Martin Williams]] said: &quot;Duke Ellington lived long enough to hear himself named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all uncommon to see him named, along with [[Charles Ives]], as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Williams, liner notes, ''Duke Ellington's Symphony in Black'', The Smithsonian Jazz Repertory Ensemble conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]], The [[Smithsonian]] Collections recording, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 1999: &quot;[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'', April 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Duke Ellington on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). ''100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia''. Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-963-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duke Ellington star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6535 Hollywood Blvd.]]
His compositions have been revisited by artists and musicians around the world both as a source of inspiration and a bedrock of their own performing careers.

*[[Dave Brubeck]] dedicated &quot;The Duke&quot; (1954) to Ellington and it became a standard covered by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The album ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' has a vocal version of this piece, &quot;You Swing Baby (The Duke)&quot;, with lyrics by Iola Brubeck, Dave Brubeck's wife. It is performed as a duet between [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Carmen McRae]]. It is also dedicated to Duke Ellington.
*[[Miles Davis]] created his half-hour [[dirge]] &quot;He Loved Him Madly&quot; (on ''[[Get Up with It]]'') as a tribute to Ellington one month after his death.
*[[Charles Mingus]], who had been fired by Ellington decades earlier, wrote the elegy &quot;Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love&quot; in 1974, a few months after Ellington's death.
*[[Stevie Wonder]] wrote the song &quot;[[Sir Duke]]&quot; as a tribute to Ellington which appeared on his album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' released in 1976.

There are hundreds of albums dedicated to the music of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn by artists famous and obscure. ''[[Sophisticated Ladies]]'', an award-winning 1981 musical revue, incorporated many tunes from Ellington's repertoire. A second Broadway musical interpolating Ellington's music, ''[[Play On (musical)|Play On!]]'', debuted in 1997.

===Loss of material===
On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Duke Ellington among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rahsaan Roland Kirk''' (August 7, 1935&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove&quot;&gt;Kernfeld, Barry. &quot;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/J248200 Kirk, Roland].&quot; ''The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz'', 2nd ed. Ed. Barry Kernfeld. ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]''. ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Oxford Music Online|Oxford Music Online]]''. Retrieved on 2009-02-01. &quot;The year of his birth has been widely given as 1936, but his birth certificate gives 1935 and confirms Ronald, not Roland.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; – December 5, 1977) was an American [[jazz]] [[multi-instrumentalist]] who played [[tenor saxophone]], [[flute]], and many other instruments. He was renowned for his onstage vitality, during which virtuoso improvisation was accompanied by comic banter, political ranting, and the ability to play several instruments simultaneously.

== Life ==

Kirk was born Ronald Theodore Kirk&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove&quot; /&gt; in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], where he lived in a neighborhood known as [[Flytown]]. He became blind at two years old, which he said was a result of improper medical treatment. As a teenager, Kirk studied at the [[Ohio State School for the Blind]]. By age fifteen he was on the road playing rhythm and blues on weekends with Boyd Moore's band. According to saxophonist [[Hank Crawford]], &quot;He would be like this 14 year-old blind kid playing two horns at once. They would bring him out and he would tear the joint up.&quot; Hank heard him during this period and said he was unbelievable. He remarked, &quot;Now they had him doing all kinds of goofy stuff but he was playing the two horns and he was playing the shit out of them. He was an original from the beginning.&quot;&lt;ref name=Heining&gt;[https://www.allaboutjazz.com/roland-kirk-here-comes-the-whistleman-roland-kirk-by-duncan-heining.php Roland Kirk: Here Comes The Whistleman], ''[[All About Jazz]]'', Duncan Heining, October 19, 2016. Retrieved August 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make '&quot;Roland&quot;.&lt;ref name=Heining /&gt; In 1970, Kirk added &quot;Rahsaan&quot; to his name after hearing it in a dream.&lt;ref name=Giddins&gt;[[Gary Giddins]] (2000) Visions of Jazz: The First Century. Oxford University Press; Chapter 47: Rahsaan Roland Kirk (One Man Band)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk was politically outspoken. During his concerts, between songs he often talked about topical issues, including [[African-American history]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. His monologues were often laced with satire and absurdist humor. According to comedian [[Jay Leno]], when Leno toured with Kirk as Kirk's opening act, Kirk would introduce him by saying, &quot;I want to introduce a young brother who knows the black experience and knows all about the white devils .... Please welcome Jay Leno!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCaXb0Fi4HEC&amp;q=leno+%22rahsaan+roland+kirk%22&amp;pg=PT132|title=Satiristas: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs &amp; Vulgarians|last=Provenza|first=Paul|author2=Dan Dion|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0061859342|page=s368}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}}

In 1975, Kirk suffered a major stroke which led to partial paralysis of one side of his body. He continued to perform and record, modifying his instruments to enable him to play with one arm. At a live performance at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in London he even managed to play two instruments, and carried on to tour internationally and to appear on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/26e696f79975401f8b8677dd8b766e88|title=Newcastle Jazz Festival|work=Genome Radio Times 1923-2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yitzhak Rabin''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|b|iː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/rabin &quot;Rabin&quot;]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|יִצְחָק רַבִּין}}, {{IPA-he|jitsˈχak ʁaˈbin|IPA|He-Yitzhak_Rabin.ogg}}; 1 March 1922 – 4 November 1995) was an Israeli politician, statesman and general. He was the fifth [[List of Prime Ministers of Israel|Prime Minister of Israel]], serving two terms in office, 1974–77, and 1992 until [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|his assassination]] in 1995.

Rabin was born in Jerusalem to Jewish immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and was raised in a [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] household. He learned agriculture in school and excelled as a student. He led a 27-year career as a soldier. As a teenager he joined the [[Palmach]], the [[commando]] force of the [[Yishuv]]. He eventually rose through its ranks to become its chief of operations during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. He joined the newly formed [[Israel Defense Forces]] in late 1948 and continued to rise as a promising officer. He helped shape the training doctrine of the IDF in the early 1950s, and led the IDF's [[Operations Directorate]] from 1959 to 1963. He was appointed [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of the General Staff]] in 1964 and oversaw Israel's victory in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

Rabin served as Israel's ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, during a period of deepening [[Israel–United States relations|U.S.–Israel ties]]. He was appointed Prime Minister of Israel in 1974, after the resignation of [[Golda Meir]]. In his first term, Rabin signed the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] and ordered the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]]. He resigned in 1977 in the wake of a financial scandal. Rabin was Israel's minister of defense for much of the 1980s, including during the outbreak of the [[First Intifada]].

In 1992, Rabin was re-elected as prime minister on a platform embracing the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership as part of the [[Oslo Accords]].  In 1994, Rabin won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] together with long-time political rival [[Shimon Peres]] and Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]]. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named [[Yigal Amir]], who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Amir was convicted of Rabin's murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Rabin was the first [[Sabra (person)|native-born]] prime minister of Israel, the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after [[Levi Eshkol]]. Rabin has become a symbol of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.

==Personal life==

===Family background===
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Life of Lt. Gen. Yitzhak Rabin, 7th IDF Chief of Staff in photos (21).jpg|thumb|left|Rabin as a baby with his mother]]
Rabin was born at [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]] in [[Jerusalem]] on 1 March 1922, [[Mandatory Palestine]], to Nehemiah (1886 – 1 December 1971) and Rosa (née Cohen; 1890 – 12 November 1937)  Rabin, immigrants of the [[Third Aliyah]], the third wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine from Europe. Nehemiah was born Nehemiah Rubitzov in the [[shtetl]] Sydorovychi near [[Ivankiv]] in the southern [[Pale of Settlement]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=izrus.co.il|url=http://jewish.kiev.ua/news/3383/ |title=Доказано украинское происхождение Ицхака Рабина &amp;#124; Еврейские новости мира и Украины &amp;#124; ВЕК – Всеукраинский еврейский конгресс|publisher=Jewish.kiev.ua|date=18 March 2010|access-date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Menachem died when he was a boy, and Nehemiah worked to support his family from an early age. At the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, where he joined the [[Poale Zion]] party and changed his surname to Rabin. In 1917, Nehemiah Rabin went to Mandatory Palestine with a group of volunteers from the [[Jewish Legion]].

Yitzhak's mother, Rosa Cohen, was born in 1890 in [[Mogilev]] in Belarus. Her father, a [[rabbi]], opposed the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and sent Rosa to a Christian high school for girls in [[Gomel]], which gave her a broad general education. Early on, Rosa took an interest in political and social causes. In 1919, she traveled to Palestine on the steamship ''Ruslan''. After working on a [[kibbutz]] on the shores of the [[Sea of Galilee]], she moved to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dadalos.org/int/Vorbilder/vorbilder/rabin/leben.htm#Eltern Yitzhak Rabin&amp;nbsp;– from soldier to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516224539/http://www.dadalos.org/int/vorbilder/vorbilder/Rabin/leben.htm#Eltern |date=16 May 2010 }} Dadalos&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin's parents met in Jerusalem during the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Robert|title=Rabin of Israel: Biography of the Embattled Prime Minister|date=1993|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312093683|page=[https://archive.org/details/rabinofisrael0000slat/page/25 25]|url=https://archive.org/details/rabinofisrael0000slat/page/25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to [[Tel Aviv]]'s Chlenov Street near [[Jaffa]] in 1923. Nehemiah became a worker for the [[Israel Electric Corporation|Palestine Electric Corporation]] and Rosa was an accountant and local activist. She became a member of the Tel Aviv City Council.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved again in 1931 to a two-room apartment on Hamagid Street in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life and education===

Rabin grew up in [[Tel Aviv]], where the family relocated when he was one year old. He enrolled in the Tel Aviv Beit Hinuch Leyaldei Ovdim (בית חינוך לילדי עובדים, &quot;School House for Workers' Children&quot;) in 1928 and completed his studies there in 1935. The school taught the children agriculture as well as Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin mostly received good marks in school, but he was so [[shyness|shy]] that few people knew he was intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Rabin enrolled at an agricultural school on kibbutz [[Givat Hashlosha]] that his mother founded. It was here in 1936 at the age of 14 that Rabin joined the [[Haganah]] and received his first military training, learning how to use a pistol and stand guard. He joined a socialist-Zionist youth movement, [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed|HaNoar HaOved]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, pp. 37, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, he enrolled at the two-year [[Kadoorie Agricultural High School]]. He excelled in a number of agriculture-related subjects but disliked studying [[English language]]—the language of the British &quot;enemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Dan|title=Soldier of Peace: The Life of Yitzhak Rabin, 1922–1995|date=1998|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0060186844|edition=1.|page=[https://archive.org/details/soldierofpeaceli00kurz/page/75 75]|url=https://archive.org/details/soldierofpeaceli00kurz/page/75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He originally aspired to be an [[irrigation]] engineer, but his interest in military affairs intensified in 1938, when the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|ongoing Arab revolt]] worsened. A young Haganah sergeant named [[Yigal Allon]], later a general in the IDF and prominent politician, trained Rabin and others at Kadoorie. Rabin finished at Kadoorie in August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; For part of 1939, the British closed Kadoorie, and Rabin joined Allon as a [[military police]]man at Kibbutz [[Ginosar]] until the school re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; When he finished school, Rabin considered studying irrigation engineering on scholarship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], although he ultimately decided to stay and fight in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - PM YITZHAK RABIN and his family at his apartment.jpg|thumb|Rabin at home with his wife, grandson, daughter, then son-in-law, and two of his granddaughters in 1992.]]

Rabin married [[Leah Rabin|Leah Schlossberg]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Leah Rabin was working at the time as a reporter for a [[Palmach]] newspaper. They had two children, [[Dalia Rabin-Pelossof|Dalia]] (born 19 March 1950) and Yuval (born 18 June 1955). Similar to the entire Israeli elite of the time, Rabin adhered to a [[Jewish secularism|secular-national understanding of Jewish identity]], and was non-religious. American diplomat [[Dennis Ross]] described him as &quot;the most secular Jew he had met in Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Ross]]. August 2004. ''The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace''. [[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]]. p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:YitzhakRabin1948.png|thumb|200px|Yitzhak Rabin, commander of the [[Harel Brigade]], c. 1948]]
===Palmach===
In 1941, during his practical training at kibbutz [[Ramat Yohanan]], Rabin joined the newly formed [[Palmach]] section of the [[Haganah]], under the influence of [[Yigal Allon]]. Rabin could not yet operate a machine gun, drive a car, or ride a motorcycle, but [[Moshe Dayan]] accepted the new recruit.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The first operation he participated in was assisting the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|allied invasion of Lebanon]], then held by [[Vichy French]] forces (the same operation in which Dayan lost his eye) in June–July 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Allon continued to train the young Palmach forces.

As a Palmachnik, Rabin and his men had to lie low to avoid arousing inquiry from the British administration. They spent most of their time farming, training secretly part-time.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; They wore no uniforms and received no public recognition during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Rabin took command of a platoon at [[Kfar Giladi]]. He trained his men in modern tactics and how to conduct lightning attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war the relationship between the Palmach and the British authorities became strained, especially with respect to the treatment of Jewish immigration. In October 1945 Rabin planned a Palmach raid on the [[Atlit detainee camp]] in which 208 [[Aliyah Bet|Jewish illegal immigrants]] who had been interned there were freed. In the [[Operation Agatha|Black Shabbat]], a massive British operation against the leaders of the Jewish Establishment in the British Mandate of Palestine and the Palmach, Rabin was arrested and detained for five months. After his release he became the commander of the second Palmach battalion and rose to the position of Chief Operations Officer of the Palmach in October 1947.

===IDF service===

[[File:Yitzhak Rabin, Chief of General Staff.jpg|thumb|Rabin as IDF Chief of Staff in 1964]]
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] Rabin directed Israeli operations in Jerusalem and fought the Egyptian army in the [[Negev]]. During the beginning of the war he was the commander of the [[Harel Brigade]], which fought on the road to Jerusalem from the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]], including the Israeli &quot;[[Burma Road (Israel)|Burma Road]]&quot;, as well as many battles in Jerusalem, such as securing the southern side of the city by recapturing [[kibbutz]] [[Ramat Rachel]].
   
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War#First truce: 11 June – 8 July 1948|first truce]] Rabin commanded IDF forces on the beach of Tel Aviv confronting the [[Irgun]] during the [[Altalena Affair]].

In the following period he was the deputy commander of [[Operation Danny]], the largest scale operation to that point, which involved four IDF brigades. The cities of [[Ramle]] and [[Lod|Lydda]] were captured, as well as the major airport in Lydda, as part of the operation. Following the capture of the two towns [[1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle|there was an exodus of their Arab population]]. Rabin signed the expulsion order, which included the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... 1. The inhabitants of Lydda must be expelled quickly without attention to age. ... 2. Implement immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Benny|author-link=Benny Morris|title=The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947–1949|url=https://archive.org/details/birthofpalestini00morr|url-access=registration|series=Cambridge Middle East Library|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/birthofpalestini00morr/page/207 207]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, Rabin was chief of operations for the Southern Front and participated in the major battles ending the fighting there, including [[Operation Yoav]] and [[Operation Horev]].

In the beginning of 1949 he was a member of the Israeli delegation to the armistice talks with Egypt that were held on the island of [[Rhodes]]. The result of the negotiations were the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which ended the official hostilities of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Following the [[demobilization]] at the end of the war he was the most senior (former) member of the [[Palmach]] that remained in the IDF.

Like many Palmach leaders, Rabin was politically aligned with the left wing pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] party and later [[Mapam]]. These officers were distrusted by Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and several resigned from the army in 1953 after [[The Generals' Revolt|a series of confrontations]]. Those members of Mapam who remained, such as Rabin, [[Haim Bar-Lev]] and [[David Elazar]], had to endure several years in staff or training posts before resuming their careers.&lt;ref&gt;Peri, Yoram. &quot;Between battles and ballots. Israeli military in politics.&quot; Cambridge University Press. 1983. {{ISBN|0-521-24414-5}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin headed Israel's [[Northern Command (Israel)|Northern Command]] from 1956 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yitzhak Rabin Center|title=Biography of Yitzhak Rabin|url=http://www.rabincenter.org.il/Items/00970/BIOGRAPHY_OF_YITZHAK_RABIN.pdf|page=3|date=n.d.|author1-link=Yitzhak Rabin Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was appointed [[Ramatkal|chief of staff]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) by [[Levi Eshkol]], who had replaced [[David Ben-Gurion]] as [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] and [[Minister of Defence (Israel)|Minister of Defence]]. Since Eshkol did not have much military experience and trusted Rabin's judgement, he had a very free hand. According to the memoirs of Eshkol's [[Aide-de-camp|military secretary]], Eshkol followed Rabin &quot;with closed eyes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maoz|first1=Zeev|title=Defending the Holy Land|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472115405|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=bWEV__6BYPgC&amp;pg=PA101 100–101]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his command, the IDF achieved victory over [[Egypt]], Syria and [[Jordan]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. After the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]] was captured by the IDF, Rabin was among the first to visit the Old City, and delivered a famous speech on [[Mount Scopus]], at the [[Hebrew University]]. In the days leading up to the war, it was reported that Rabin suffered a [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was unable to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051701976_pf.html|title=Prelude to the Six Days|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 May 2007|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this short hiatus, he resumed full command over the IDF.

==Ambassador and Minister of Labour==
Following his retirement from the IDF he became ambassador to the United States beginning in 1968, serving for five years. In this period the US became the major weapon supplier of Israel and in particular he managed to get the embargo on the [[F-4 Phantom]] fighter jets lifted. During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] he served in no official capacity and in the [[1973 Israeli legislative election|elections held at the end of 1973]] he was elected to the [[Knesset]] as a member of the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]]. He was appointed Israeli Minister of Labour in March 1974 in [[Golda Meir]]'s short-lived government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/rabin.html Jewish Virtual Library] Yitzhak Rabin&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as ambassador, Rabin met and formed a relationship with [[Menachem M. Schneerson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|B7dzMf_wS-Y|Yitchok Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, recalls his visit to Menachem Schneerson in 1972.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First term as Prime Minister==
[[File:Channel2 - Yitzhak Rabin.webm|thumb|Short video about Yitzhak Rabin from the [[Israeli News Company]]]]

Following Golda Meir's resignation in April 1974, Rabin was elected party leader, after he defeated [[Shimon Peres]]. The rivalry between these two Labour leaders remained fierce and they competed several times in the next two decades for the leadership role, and even for who deserved credit for government achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-29/news/mn-21196_1_rabin-peres-jordan|title=Rivalry Between Rabin, Peres Rekindled Over Who Deserves Credit for Jordan Pact |last=Parks|first=Michael|date=29 July 1994|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin succeeded [[Golda Meir]] as [[Prime Minister of Israel]] on 3 June 1974. This was a coalition government, including [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]], the [[Independent Liberals (Israel)|Independent Liberals]], Progress and Development and the Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers. This arrangement, with a bare [[parliamentary majority]], held for a few months and was one of the few periods in Israel's history where the religious parties were not part of the coalition. The [[National Religious Party]] joined the coalition on 30 October 1974 and Ratz left on 6 November.

In foreign policy, the major development at the beginning of Rabin's term was the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] between Israel and Egypt, signed on 1 September 1975. Both countries declared that the conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/egypt_interim_eng.htm |title=Interim Agreement between Israel and Egypt |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |access-date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement followed [[Henry Kissinger]]'s shuttle diplomacy and a threatened [[Gerald Ford#Foreign policy|&quot;reassessment&quot;]] of the United States' regional policy and its relations with Israel. Rabin notes it was &quot;an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American–Israeli relations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yitzak Rabin, ''The Rabin Memoirs'', {{ISBN|0-520-20766-1}}, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; But the agreement was an important step towards the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978 and the [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty|peace treaty with Egypt]] signed in 1979.

[[Operation Entebbe]] was perhaps the most dramatic event during Rabin's first term of office. On his orders, the IDF performed a long-range undercover raid to rescue passengers of an [[Aircraft hijacking|airliner hijacked]] by militants belonging to the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]'s [[Wadie Haddad]] faction and the German [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|Revolutionary Cells]] (RZ), who had been brought to [[Idi Amin]]'s [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;name of reference goes here&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prime Ministers: An Intimate Narrative of Israeli Leadership|last=Avner|first=Yehuda|author-link=Yehuda Avner|year=2010|publisher=The Toby Press|isbn=978-1-59264-278-6 |pages=303–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was generally considered a tremendous success, and its spectacular character has made it the subject of much continued comment and study.

Towards the end of 1976 his coalition government with the religious parties suffered a crisis: A [[motion of no confidence]] had been brought by [[Agudat Yisrael]] over a breach of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] on an Israeli Air Force base when four [[F-15]] jets were delivered from the US and the National Religious Party had abstained. Rabin dissolved his government and decided on new elections, which were to be held in May 1977.

Following the March 1977 meeting between Rabin and U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], Rabin publicly announced that the U.S. supported the Israeli idea of defensible borders; Carter then issued a clarification. A &quot;fallout&quot; in U.S./Israeli relations ensued. It is thought that the fallout contributed to the Israeli Labor Party's defeat in the May 1977 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[William B.

Rabin resigned on 8 April 1977, following the revelation by ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' journalist S.

==Opposition Knesset member and Minister of Defense==
Following his resignation and Labour Party defeat at the elections, [[Likud]]'s [[Menachem Begin]] was [[1977 Israeli legislative election|elected in 1977]]. Until 1984 Rabin had been a member of Knesset and had sat on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. From 1984 to 1990, he served as [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] in several [[national unity government]]s led by prime ministers [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Shimon Peres]]. When Rabin came to office, Israeli troops were still deep in Lebanon. Rabin ordered their withdrawal to a &quot;Security Zone&quot; on the Lebanese side of the border. The [[South Lebanon Army]] was active in this zone, along with the [[Israeli Defence Forces]].

On 4 August 1985 Minister of Defence Rabin introduced an Iron Fist policy in the West Bank, reviving the use of British Mandate era [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|legislation]] to detain people without trial, demolish houses, close newspapers and institutions as well as deporting activists. The change in policy came after a sustained public campaign demanding a tougher policy following the [[Jibril Agreement|May 1985]] prisoner exchange in which 1,150 Palestinians had been released.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joost Hiltermann|Hiltermann, Joost R.]] (1991).

When the [[first Intifada]] broke out, Rabin adopted harsh measures to stop the demonstrations, even authorizing the use of &quot;Force, might and beatings,&quot; on the demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/26/world/us-jews-torn-over-arab-beatings.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 January 1988|title=U.S. Jews Torn Over Arab Beatings|first=David K.|last=Shipler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/12/world/israel-declines-to-study-rabin-tie-to-beatings.html?pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 July 1990|title=Israel Declines to Study Rabin Tie to Beatings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin the &quot;bone breaker&quot; was used as an International image.&lt;ref name=Shlaim/&gt; The combination of the failure of the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; policy, Israel's deteriorating international image, and Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the [[West Bank]] with the U.S.'s recognition of the [[PLO]] as the representative of the [[Palestinian people]] forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence through negotiation and dialogue with the PLO.&lt;ref name=Shlaim&gt;{{cite book|last=Shlaim|first=Avi|year=2000|title=The Iron Wall; Israel and the Arab World|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-028870-8|pages=453–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/peacefacts/023.199511.sicherman.rabinappreciation.html|work=Foreign Policy Research Institute|title=Yitzhak Rabin: An Appreciation|first=Harvey|last=Sicherman|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909204606/http://www.fpri.org/peacefacts/023.199511.sicherman.rabinappreciation.html|archive-date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1992, Rabin again served as a [[Knesset]] member and sat on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

==Second term as Prime Minister==

In 1992 Rabin was elected as chairman of the Labor Party, winning against Shimon Peres. In the [[1992 Israeli legislative election|elections that year]] his party, strongly focusing on the popularity of its leader, managed to win a clear victory over the Likud of incumbent Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. However, the left-wing bloc in the [[Knesset]] only won an overall narrow majority, facilitated by the disqualification of small nationalist parties that did not manage to pass the electoral threshold. Rabin formed the first Labor-led government in fifteen years, supported by a coalition with [[Meretz]], a left wing party, and [[Shas]], a [[Mizrahi Jew|Mizrahi]] [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-orthodox]] religious party.

On 25 July 1993, after [[Hezbollah]] fired rockets into northern Israel, Rabin authorized a week-long [[Operation Accountability|military operation]] in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mako.co.il/pzm-israel-wars/operation-accountability/Article-1ac1946697ec041006.htm &quot;Operation Accountability: Step by step,&quot; ''Mako'', 12-09-93 (Hebrew)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Concerns about mal-ware on Website: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/lebanon-accountability.htm|title=Operation Accountability|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Rabin played a leading role in the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]], which created the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and granted it partial control over parts of the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]]. Prior to the signing of the accords, Rabin received [[Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|a letter]] from PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel, and on the same day, 9 September 1993, Rabin sent Arafat a letter officially recognizing the PLO.&lt;ref name=Gelvin2007&gt;{{cite book |year=2007 |author=Gelvin, James L |author-link=James L.

After the announcement of the [[Oslo Accords]] there were many protest demonstrations in Israel objecting to the Accords. As these protests dragged on, Rabin insisted that as long as he had a majority in the [[Knesset]] he would ignore the protests and the protesters. In this context he said, &quot;they (the protesters) can spin around and around like propellers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Her Grandfather, His Legacy |author=Leora Eren Frucht |url=http://info.jpost.com/C005/Supplements/Rabin/5.01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324012050/http://info.jpost.com/C005/Supplements/Rabin/5.01.html |archive-date=24 March 2006 |work=Jerusalem Post |date= 3 November 2000 |access-date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he would continue on the path of the Oslo Accords.

===Economic and social reforms===
Rabin significantly reformed Israel's economy, as well as its education and healthcare systems. His government significantly expanded the [[privatization]] of business, moving away from the country's traditionally socialized economy. The scheme was described by [[Moshe Arens]] as a &quot;privatization frenzy&quot;. In 1993, his government set up the &quot;Yozma&quot; program, under which attractive tax incentives were offered to foreign [[venture capital]] funds that invested in Israel and promised to double any investment with government funding. As a result, foreign venture capital funds invested heavily in the growing Israeli high-tech industry, contributing to Israel's economic growth and status as a world leader in high-tech. In 1995, the National Health Insurance Law was passed. The law created Israel's [[universal health care]] system, moving away from the traditionally [[Histadrut]]-dominated health insurance system. Doctors' wages were also raised by 50%. Education spending was raised by 70%, with new colleges being built in Israel's peripheral areas, and teachers' wages rising by one-fifth. His government also launched new public works projects such as the [[Highway 6 (Israel)|Cross-Israel Highway]] and an expansion of [[Ben Gurion Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/yitzhak-rabins-little-known-economic-legacy-2015-10-29|title=Yitzhak Rabin's little-known economic legacy|first=Amotz|last=Asa-El}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/watch-what-you-privatize-1.5392904|title=Be Careful What You Privatize|date=30 August 2015|newspaper=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5410499|title=The Bottom Line / When the Horses Are Far, Far Away|date=26 September 2001|newspaper=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/silicon-israel-13208.html|title=Silicon Israel|date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination and aftermath==
{{Main|Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin}}

On the evening of 4 November 1995 (12th of [[Heshvan]] on the Hebrew Calendar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=4&amp;gm=11&amp;gy=1995&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=Convert+Gregorian+to+Hebrew+date 4 November 1995] ''hebcal''&lt;/ref&gt;), Rabin was assassinated by [[Yigal Amir]], a [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremist]] who opposed the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]]. Rabin had been attending a mass rally at the [[Rabin Square|Kings of Israel Square]] (now Rabin Square) in [[Tel Aviv]], held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards the open door of his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a [[semi-automatic pistol]]. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center|Ichilov Hospital]], where he died on the operating table of blood loss and two punctured [[human lung|lungs]]. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards and police. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel's foreign minister, [[Shimon Peres]], was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2514000/2514437.stm BBC] On This Day&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabin's assassination came as a great shock to the Israeli public and much of the rest of the world. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis thronged the square where Rabin was assassinated to mourn his death. Young people, in particular, turned out in large numbers, lighting memorial candles and singing peace songs. On 6 November 1995, he was buried on [[Mount Herzl]]. Rabin's funeral was attended by many world leaders, among them U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]], Australian Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and [[King Hussein of Jordan]]. Clinton delivered a eulogy whose final words were in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] – &quot;Shalom, Haver&quot; ({{lang-he|שלום חבר}}, lit. ''Goodbye, Friend'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/rabin/umbrella/index.html The Assassination and Funeral of Yitzhak Rabin] CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jewish/haver.html |title=Shalom haver |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623191631/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jewish/haver.html |archive-date=23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The square where he was assassinated, ''Kikar Malkhei Yisrael'' (Kings of Israel Square), was renamed [[Rabin Square]] in his honor. Many other streets and public institutions in Israel have also subsequently been named after him. After his assassination, Rabin was hailed as a national symbol and came to embody the ethos of the &quot;Israeli peace camp,&quot; despite his military career and hawkish views earlier in life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010303172917/http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/Rabin/7.html Jpost] &quot;Third anniversary commemoration, Yitzhak Rabin: The Sabra, the Mensch'' By Abraham Rabinovich&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, his wife Leah died and was buried alongside him.

After the murder, it was revealed that [[Avishai Raviv]], a well known right-wing extremist at the time, was in fact a [[Shin Bet]] agent-informer code-named Champagne. Raviv was later acquitted in court of charges that he failed to prevent the assassination. The court ruled there was no evidence that Raviv knew assassin Yigal Amir was plotting to kill Rabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avishai Raviv acquitted of having failed to prevent Rabin assassination|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/avishai-raviv-acquitted-of-having-failed-to-prevent-rabin-assassination-1.14368|access-date=8 September 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=1 April 2003|author=Moshe Reinfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rabin's assassination, his daughter [[Dalia Rabin-Pelossof]] entered politics and was elected to the Knesset in 1999 as part of the [[Center Party (Israel)|Center Party]]. In 2001, she served as Israel's deputy [[Defense Minister of Israel|minister of defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deputy Defense Minister Dalia Rabin-Pelossof|url=http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=6821|access-date=8 September 2013|newspaper=IMRA|date=12 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

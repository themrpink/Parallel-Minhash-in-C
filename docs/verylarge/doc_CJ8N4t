===Higher capacity===
[[File:Urbos 3 2014-08-10.jpg|thumb|[[Sydney]]'s [[Dulwich Hill Line]] is mostly situated on segregated tracks along a former heavy rail corridor]]

At the highest degree of separation, it can be difficult to draw the line between light rail and [[rapid transit|metro]]s. The London [[Docklands Light Railway]] would likely not be considered as &quot;light rail&quot; were it not for the contrast between it and the [[rapid transit]] [[London Underground]]. In Europe and Asia, the term ''light rail'' is increasingly used to describe any rapid transit system with a fairly low frequency or short trains compared to heavier mass rapid systems such as the [[London Underground]] or Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]]. However upon closer inspection, these systems are better classified as [[light metro]] or [[people mover]]s. For instance, [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]] and [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]] in [[Manila]] are often referred to as &quot;light rail&quot;, despite being fully segregated, mostly elevated railways. This phenomenon is quite common in East Asian cities, where elevated metro lines in [[Shanghai Metro|Shanghai]], [[Wuhan Metro|Wuhan]], and [[Dalian Metro|Dalian]] in China; and [[Jakarta LRT|Jakarta]], [[Greater Jakarta LRT|Greater Jakarta]] and [[Palembang LRT|Palembang]] in Indonesia are called light rail lines. In North America, such systems are not usually considered light rail.

===Mixed systems===
[[File:1063(176) MTR Light Rail 751 20-08-2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]] [[Light Rail (MTR)|Light Rail]] serves the northwest suburbs with unidirectional high floor LRVs.]]
Many systems have mixed characteristics. Indeed, with proper engineering, a rail line could run along a street, then go underground, and then run along an elevated viaduct. For example, the Los Angeles [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Metro Rail]]'s [[L Line (Los Angeles Metro)|L Line]] &quot;light rail&quot; has sections that could alternatively be described as a tramway, a light metro, and, in a narrow sense, rapid transit. This is especially common in the United States, where there is not a popularly perceived distinction between these different types of urban rail systems. The development of technology for low-floor and catenary-free trams facilitates construction of such mixed systems with only short and shallow underground sections below critical intersections as the required clearance height can be reduced significantly compared to conventional light rail vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treehugger.com/public-transportation/low-clearance-rapid-transit-cheaper-subways-faster-trolleys.html|title=Low-clearance Rapid Transit: Cheaper than subways, faster than trolleys|website=TreeHugger|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is even possible to have high-floor rapid transit cars run along a street, like a tram; this is known as ''[[street running]]''.

===Speed and stop frequency===
[[File:Kusttram2.jpg|thumb|300px|Belgium's [[Coast Tram (Belgium)|Coast Tram]] operates over almost 70&amp;nbsp;km and connects multiple town centres.]]

In some areas, &quot;light rail&quot; may also refer to any rail line with frequent low speeds or many stops in a short distance. This inherits the old definition of [[light railway]] in the UK. Hong Kong's [[Light Rail (Hong Kong)|Light Rail]] is an example of this{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, although it is also called &quot;light rail&quot; because it is a lower-scale system than the rest of the MTR. Sprinter in the San Diego area uses DMUs and is targeted towards a commuter rail audience; however, because of the large number of stops along the line, it is called light rail.

Reference speed from major light rail systems, including station stop time, is shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightrailnow.org/myths/m_lrt012.htm|title=Light Rail Schedule Speed – Faster Than Bus, Competitive With Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, low top speed is not always a differentiating characteristic between light rail and other systems. For example, the [[Siemens S70]] LRVs used in the [[Houston]] [[METRORail]] and other North American LRT systems have a top speed of {{convert|106|km/h|mph}} while the trains on the all-underground [[Montreal Metro]] can only reach a top speed of {{convert|72|km/h|mph}}. [[Los Angeles Metro]] light rail vehicles have higher top and average speeds than Montreal Metro or [[New York City Subway]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletransitblog.com/2009/12/30/link-light-rail-in-the-north-american-context/|title=Link Light Rail in the North American Context|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is that Montreal Metro and New York City Subway trains carry far more passengers than any North American LRT system, and the trains have faster acceleration, making station-to-station times relatively short in their densely populated urban areas. Most light rail systems serve less densely populated cities and suburbs where passenger traffic is not high, but low cost combined with high top speed may be important to compete with automobiles.

===System-wide considerations===
Many light rail systems—even fairly old ones—have a combination of both on- and off-road sections. In some countries (especially in Europe), only the latter is described as light rail. In those places, trams running on mixed rights-of-way are not regarded as light rail, but considered distinctly as streetcars or trams. However, the requirement for saying that a rail line is &quot;separated&quot; can be quite low—sometimes just with concrete &quot;buttons&quot; to discourage automobile drivers from getting onto the tracks. Some systems such as [[Link light rail|Seattle's Link]] are truly mixed but closed to traffic, with light rail vehicles and traditional buses both operating along a common right-of-way.

Some systems, such as the [[AirTrain JFK]] in New York City, the [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] in London, and [[Kelana Jaya Line]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], have dispensed with the need for an operator. The [[Vancouver]] [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] was an early adopter of driverless vehicles, while the [[Toronto]] [[Scarborough RT|Scarborough rapid transit]] operates the same trains as Vancouver, but uses drivers. In most discussions and comparisons, these specialized systems are generally not considered light rail but as [[Medium-capacity rail system|light metro]] systems.

==Track gauge==
Historically, the [[track gauge]] has had considerable variations, with [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now [[standard gauge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottoms&quot; /&gt; Older standard-gauge vehicles could not negotiate sharp turns as easily as narrow-gauge ones, but modern light rail systems achieve tighter turning radii by using [[articulated car]]s. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be moved around, conveniently using the same tracks as freight railways. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that [[accessibility]] laws are making [[low-floor tram]]s mandatory, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow-gauge layout. Furthermore, standard-gauge rolling stock can be switched between networks either temporarily or permanently and both newly built and used standard-gauge rolling stock tends to be cheaper to buy, as more companies offer such vehicles.

===Efficiency===

[[Energy efficiency in transportation#Trains|Energy efficiency]] for light rail may be 120 passenger miles per gallon of fuel (or equivalent), but variation is great, depending on circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buses.org/files/ComparativeEnergy.pdf Comparison of Energy Use &amp; CO2 Emissions From Different Transportation Modes ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529032904/http://www.buses.org/files/ComparativeEnergy.pdf |date=29 May 2015 }} page 7, Results of Analysis. M.J. Bradley &amp; Associates, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with high capacity roads===
One line of light rail (requires 25' Right of Way) has a theoretical capacity of up to 8 times more than one 12' lane of freeway (not counting buses) during peak times. Roads have ultimate capacity limits that can be determined by [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]]. They usually experience a chaotic breakdown in flow and a dramatic drop in speed (a [[traffic jam]]) if they exceed about 2,000 vehicles per hour per lane (each car roughly [[two-second rule (road)|two seconds]] behind another).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Lorenz and Lily Elefteriadou (2000) [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/EC018/08_52.pdf ''A Probabilistic Approach to Defining Freeway Capacity and Breakdown''] (PDF), Transportation Research Board.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most people who drive to work or on business trips do so alone, studies show that the average car occupancy on many roads carrying commuters is only about 1.5 people per car during the high-demand [[rush hour]] periods of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights of the 2001 National Household Travel Survey: A-15 Vehicle Occupancy Per Vehicle Mile by Time of Day and Weekend Status|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/table_a15.html|publisher=US Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This combination of factors limits roads carrying only automobile commuters to a maximum observed capacity of about 3,000 passengers per hour per lane. The problem can be mitigated by introducing high-occupancy vehicle ([[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV]]) lanes and [[ride-sharing]] programs, but in most cases the solution adopted has been to add more lanes to the roads.

By contrast, light rail vehicles can travel in multi-car trains carrying a theoretical ridership up to 20,000 passengers per hour in much narrower [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]], not much more than two car lanes wide for a [[double track]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Parkinson and Ian Fisher (1996) [http://nrc40.nas.edu/news/blurb_detail.asp?id=2603 ''Rail Transit Capacity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111162103/http://nrc40.nas.edu/news/blurb_detail.asp?id=2603 |date=11 January 2009 }}, Transportation Research Board.&lt;/ref&gt; They can often be run through [[tramway tracks|existing city streets and parks]], or placed in the [[median (road)|medians of roads]]. If run in streets, trains are usually limited by city block lengths to about four 180-passenger vehicles (720 passengers). Operating on two-minute headways using traffic signal progression, a well-designed two-track system can handle up to 30 trains per hour per track, achieving peak rates of over 20,000 passengers per hour in each direction. More advanced systems with separate rights-of-way using [[railway signalling|moving block signalling]] can exceed 25,000 passengers per hour per track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trb.org/news/blurb_detail.asp?id=2326 ''Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual''], Transportation Research Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical considerations===
Most light rail systems in the United States are limited by demand rather than capacity (by and large, most American LRT systems carry fewer than 4,000 persons per hour per direction), but Boston's and San Francisco's light rail lines carry 9,600 and 13,100 passengers per hour per track during rush hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Systems outside North America often have much higher passenger volumes. The [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]] is one of the highest capacity ones, having been upgraded in a series of expansions to handle 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, and having carried as many as 582,989 passengers in a single day on its [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrta.gov.ph/press_release/press_release_090112_25yrRecordHigh.htm |title=LRT-1 sets 25-year high record ridership |publisher=Manilla Light Rail Transit Authority |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326064515/http://www.lrta.gov.ph/press_release/press_release_090112_25yrRecordHigh.htm |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It achieves this volume by running four-car trains with a capacity of up to 1,350 passengers each at a frequency of up to 30 trains per hour. However, the Manila light rail system has full grade separation and as a result has many of the operating characteristics of a metro system rather than a light rail system. A capacity of 1,350 passengers per train is more similar to heavy rail than light rail.

[[Bus rapid transit]] (BRT) is an alternative to LRT and many planning studies undertake a comparison of each mode when considering appropriate investments in transit corridor development. BRT systems can exhibit a more diverse range of design characteristics than LRT, depending on the demand and constraints that exist, and BRT using dedicated lanes can have a theoretical capacity of over 30,000 passengers per hour per direction (for example, the [[Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit]] system operates up to 350 buses per hour per direction). For the effective operation of a bus or BRT system, buses must have priority at traffic lights and have their own dedicated lanes, especially as bus frequencies exceed 30 buses per hour per direction. The higher theoretical of BRT relates to the ability of buses to travel closer to each other than rail vehicles and their ability to overtake each other at designated locations allowing express services to bypass those that have stopped at stations. However, to achieve capacities this high, BRT station footprints need to be significantly larger than a typical LRT station. In terms of cost of operation, each bus vehicle requires a single driver, whereas a light rail train may have three to four cars of much larger capacity in one train under the control of one driver, or no driver at all in fully automated systems, increasing the labor costs of BRT systems compared to LRT systems. BRT systems are also usually less fuel-efficient as they use non-electrified vehicles.

The peak passenger capacity per lane per hour depends on which types of vehicles are allowed at the roads. Typically roadways have 1,900 passenger cars per lane per hour (pcplph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCHRP Report 599: Default Values for Highway Capacity and Level of Service Analyses|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_599.pdf#page=13|publisher=NATIONAL COOPERATIVE HIGHWAY RESEARCH PROGRAM}}&lt;/ref&gt; If only cars are allowed, the capacity will be less and will not increase when the traffic volume increases.

When there is a bus driving on this route, the capacity of the lane will be higher and will increase when the traffic level increases. And because the capacity of a light rail system is higher than that of a bus, there will be even more capacity when there is a combination of cars and light rail. Table 3 shows an example of peak passenger capacity.

==Safety==
An analysis of data from the 505-page National Transportation Statistics report&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=National Transportation Statistics 2013|url=http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/NTS_Entire_13Q4.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the US Department of Transportation shows that light rail fatalities are higher than all other forms of transportation except motorcycle travel (31.5 fatalities per 100&amp;nbsp;million miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dissected: How're Ya Dying? Charting transportation mayhem in its many gory varieties|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/howre-ya-dying-fatality-data-from-various-types-of-transportation-feature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the National Transportation Statistics report&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; published by the US Department of Transportation states that &quot;Caution must be exercised in comparing fatalities across modes because significantly different definitions are used. In particular, Rail and Transit fatalities include incident-related (as distinct from accident-related) fatalities, such as fatalities from falls in transit stations or railroad employee fatalities from a fire in a workshed. Equivalent fatalities for the Air and Highway modes (fatalities at airports not caused by moving aircraft or fatalities from accidents in automobile repair shops) are not counted toward the totals for these modes. Thus, fatalities not necessarily directly related to in service transportation are counted for the transit and rail modes, potentially overstating the risk for these modes.&quot;

==Construction and operation costs==
[[File:Central Station Kitchener Nov 2017.jpg|thumb|The new [[Ion rapid transit|Ion]] system in Ontario's [[Waterloo Region]] spurred massive development along its route before opening]]

[[Link Light Rail|Seattle's new light rail system]] is by far the most expensive in the US, at $179&amp;nbsp;million per mile, since it includes extensive tunneling in poor soil conditions, elevated sections, and stations as deep as  {{convert|180|ft|m}} below ground level.&lt;ref&gt;

At the other end of the scale, four systems (Baltimore, Maryland; Camden, New Jersey; Sacramento, California; and Salt Lake City, Utah) incurred construction costs of less than $20&amp;nbsp;million per mile. Over the US as a whole, excluding Seattle, new light rail construction costs average about $35&amp;nbsp;million per mile.&lt;ref name=&quot;LRNOW&quot; /&gt;

By comparison, a freeway lane expansion typically costs $1.0&amp;nbsp;million to $8.5&amp;nbsp;million per [[lane]] mile for two directions, with an average of $2.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/biz/construction/pdf/I-C_Const_Cost.pdf |title=Highway Construction Cost Comparison Survey Final Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |page=3 |date=April 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905215838/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/biz/construction/pdf/I-C_Const_Cost.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, freeways are frequently built in suburbs or rural areas, whereas light rail tends to be concentrated in urban areas, where right of way and property acquisition is expensive. Similarly, the most expensive US highway expansion project was the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts, which cost $200&amp;nbsp;million per lane mile for a total cost of $14.6&amp;nbsp;billion. A light rail track can carry up to 20,000 people per hour as compared with 2,000–2,200 vehicles per hour for one freeway lane.&lt;ref&gt;Traffic and Highway Engineering By Nicholas J. Garber, Lester A. Hoel, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Boston and San Francisco, light rail lines carry 9,600 and 13,100 passengers per hour, respectively, in the peak direction during rush hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson 2004&quot;/&gt;

Combining highway expansion with LRT construction can save costs by doing both highway improvements and rail construction at the same time. As an example, Denver's [[Transportation Expansion Project]] rebuilt interstate highways 25 and 225 and added a light rail expansion for a total cost of $1.67&amp;nbsp;billion over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Shaw |url=http://www.constructor.construction.com/coverStories/archives/2006-05.asp |title=Reinventing a Corridor: Denver's T-REX project nears completion after five years |work=Constructor |publisher=McGraw-Hill Construction |date=May–June 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019180438/http://constructor.construction.com/coverStories/archives/2006-05.asp |archivedate=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of {{convert|17|mi|km}} of highway improvements and {{convert|19|mi|km}} of double-track light rail worked out to $19.3&amp;nbsp;million per highway lane-mile and $27.6&amp;nbsp;million per LRT track-mile.

LRT cost efficiency improves dramatically as ridership increases, as can be seen from the numbers above: the same rail line, with similar capital and operating costs, is far more efficient if it is carrying 20,000 people per hour than if it is carrying 2,400. The [[Calgary]], Alberta, [[C-Train]] used many common light rail techniques to keep costs low, including minimizing underground and elevated trackage, sharing transit malls with buses, leasing rights-of-way from freight railroads, and combining LRT construction with freeway expansion. As a result, Calgary ranks toward the less expensive end of the scale with capital costs of around $24&amp;nbsp;million per mile.&lt;ref name=McKendrick&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Calgary's LRT ridership is much higher than any comparable US light rail system, at 300,000 passengers per weekday, and as a result its capital efficiency is also much higher. Its capital costs were one-third those of the [[San Diego Trolley]], a comparably sized US system built at the same time, while by 2009 its ridership was approximately three times as high. Thus, Calgary's capital cost per passenger was much lower than that of San Diego. Its operating cost per passenger was also much lower because of its higher ridership. A typical C-Train vehicle costs only {{CAD|163|round=0|year=2006|link=yes}} per hour to operate, and since it averages 600 passengers per operating hour,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Calgary Transit estimates that its LRT operating costs are only 27 cents per ride, versus $1.50 per ride on its buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKendrick&quot; /&gt;

Compared to buses, costs can be lower due to lower labor costs per passenger mile, higher ridership (observations show that light rail attracts more ridership than a comparable bus service){{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and faster average speed (reducing the number of vehicles needed for the same service frequency). While light rail vehicles are more expensive to buy, they have a longer useful life than buses, sometimes making for lower life-cycle costs.

==Health impact==

==Integration with bicycles==
Light rail lines have various policies on bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_62.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some fleets restrict bicycles on trains during peak hours. Some light rail systems, such as the St. Louis MetroLink, allow bicycles on the trains, but only in the rear sections of cars. Some light rail lines, like San Francisco's, allow only [[folding bicycle]]s on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfmuni&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/bicycling/bikes-muni |title=Bikes on Muni|publisher=[[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency]] |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some systems dedicated bike parking is available at select stations and others are integrated with local [[bike share]] systems.

==Variations==

===Trams operating on mainline railways===
{{See also|Karlsruhe model}}
[[File:Cappel Stadtbahn02 2005-12-30.jpg|right|thumb|On the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]], trams sometimes share mainline tracks with heavy rail trains]]
[[File:Carling O-Train Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Trillium Line]] in [[Ottawa]] was built along a freight railway and is still occasionally used by freight traffic overnight.]]
Around [[Karlsruhe]], [[Kassel]], and [[Saarbrücken]] in Germany, dual-voltage light rail trains partly use mainline railroad tracks, sharing these tracks with heavy rail trains. In the [[Netherlands]], this concept was first applied on the [[RijnGouweLijn]]. This allows commuters to ride directly into the city centre, rather than taking a mainline train only as far as a central station and then having change to a tram. In France, similar [[tram-train]]s are planned for Paris, [[Mulhouse]], and [[Strasbourg]]; further projects exist. In some cases, tram-trains use previously abandoned or lightly used heavy rail lines in addition to or instead of still in use mainline tracks.

Some of the issues involved in such schemes are:
* compatibility of the safety systems
* power supply of the track in relation to the power used by the vehicles (frequently different voltages, rarely third rail vs overhead wires)
* width of the vehicles in relation to the position of the [[railway platform|platforms]]
* height of the platforms

There is a history of what would now be considered light rail vehicles operating on heavy rail [[rapid transit]] tracks in the US, especially in the case of [[interurban streetcar]]s. Notable examples are [[Lehigh Valley Transit]] trains running on the [[Philadelphia and Western Railroad]] high-speed third rail line (now the [[Norristown High Speed Line]]). Such arrangements are almost impossible now, due to the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] refusing (for crash safety reasons) to allow non-FRA compliant railcars (i.e., subway and light rail vehicles) to run on the same tracks at the same times as compliant railcars, which includes locomotives and standard railroad passenger and freight equipment. Notable exceptions in the US are the [[NJ Transit]] [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] from [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and Austin's [[Capital MetroRail]], which have received exemptions to the provision that light rail operations occur only during daytime hours and [[Bordentown Secondary#Today|Conrail]] freight service only at night, with several hours separating one operation from the other. The [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line]] in Ottawa also has freight service at certain hours.

===Third-rail power for trams===
{{Main|Ground-level power supply}}

When electric streetcars were introduced in the late 19th century, [[conduit current collection]] was one of the first ways of supplying power, but it proved to be much more expensive, complicated, and trouble-prone than [[overhead wires]]. When electric street railways became ubiquitous, conduit power was used in those cities that did not permit overhead wires. In Europe, it was used in London, Paris, Berlin, Marseille, Budapest, and Prague. In the United States, it was used in parts of New York City and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Post|first=Robert C.|title=Urban Mass Transit: The Life Story of a Technology|url=https://archive.org/details/urbanmasstransit00post|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/urbanmasstransit00post/page/n61 45]–47|isbn=978-0-313-33916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third rail]] technology was investigated for use on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] of Australia for the [[G:link]] light rail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pb.com.au/gclightrail |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030319223746/http://www.pb.com.au/gclightrail/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 March 2003 |title=Gold Coast Light Rail Feasibility Study |publisher=Commonwealth Government, Gold Coast City Council &amp; Queensland Government Queensland Transport |date=23 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though power from [[overhead line]]s was ultimately utilized for that system.

In the French city of [[Bordeaux]], the [[Bordeaux tramway|tramway network]] is powered by a [[Ground-level power supply|third rail]] in the city centre, where the tracks are not always segregated from pedestrians and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press|title=Bordeaux Light Rail Route Will Operate Without Overhead Lines |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |year=2003 |url=http://www.apta.com/services/intnatl/intfocus/bordeaux.cfm |accessdate=2007-12-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201155854/http://www.apta.com/services/intnatl/intfocus/bordeaux.cfm |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third rail (actually two closely spaced rails) is placed in the middle of the track and divided into eight-metre sections, each of which is powered only while it is completely covered by a tram. This minimises the risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a live rail. In outer areas, the trams switch to conventional [[Overhead lines|overhead wires]]. The Bordeaux power system costs about three times as much as a conventional overhead wire system, and took 24 months to achieve acceptable levels of reliability, requiring replacement of all the main cables and power supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/contractors/suburban/alstom/press17.html|accessdate=2009-12-26|title=99% AVAILABILITY AND EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH PASSENGER LEVELS : THE BORDEAUX URBAN TRAMWAY IS A RESOUNDING SUCCESS|website=Railway-Technology.com|publisher=Net Resources International|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613175705/http://www.railway-technology.com/contractors/suburban/alstom/press17.html |archivedate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating and maintenance costs of the innovative power system still remain high. However, despite numerous service outages, the system was a success with the public, gaining up to 190,000 passengers per day.

==Comparison to other rail transit modes==
With its mix of right-of-way types and train control technologies, LRT offers the widest range of latitude of any rail system in the design, engineering, and operating practices. The challenge in designing light rail systems is to realize the potential of LRT to provide fast, comfortable service while avoiding the tendency to overdesign that results in excessive capital costs beyond what is necessary to meet the public's needs.&lt;ref&gt;

|-
| [[Rapid transit]]
| Light rail vehicles (LRVs) are distinguished from [[rapid transit|rapid rail transit]] (RRT) vehicles by their capability for operation in mixed traffic, generally resulting in a narrower car body and articulation in order to operate in a street traffic environment. With their large size, large turning radius, and often an electrified [[third rail]], RRT vehicles cannot operate in the street. Since LRT systems can operate in existing streets, they can often avoid the cost of expensive [[grade-separated]] subway and elevated segments that would be required with RRT.
|-
| [[Tram|Streetcars or trams]]
| Conversely, LRVs generally outperform traditional streetcars in terms of capacity and top-end speed, and almost all modern LRVs are capable of [[multiple-unit operation]]. The latest generation of LRVs is considerably larger and faster, typically {{convert|29|m|ft}} long with a maximum speed of around {{convert|105|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Data |url=http://references.transportation.siemens.com/refdb/showReference.do?r=1920&amp;div=3&amp;div=5&amp;div=2&amp;div=8&amp;l=en |work=Light Rail Vehicle System Houston/Texas, USA |publisher=Siemens |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427042721/http://references.transportation.siemens.com/refdb/showReference.do?r=1920&amp;div=3&amp;div=5&amp;div=2&amp;div=8&amp;l=en |archivedate=27 April 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Heritage streetcar]]s
|A variation considered by many cities is to use historic or replica cars on their streetcar systems instead of modern LRVs. A heritage streetcar may not have the capacity and speed of an LRV, but it will add to the ambiance and historic character of its location.
|-
|[[Medium capacity system|Light metro]]
|A derivative of LRT is light rail rapid transit (LRRT), also referred to as ''light metro.'' Such railways are characterized by exclusive rights of way, advanced train control systems, short headway capability, and floor-level boarding. These systems approach the passenger capacity of full metro systems, but can be cheaper to construct due to LRVs generally being smaller in size, turning tighter curves and climbing steeper grades than standard RRT vehicles, and having a smaller station size.
|-
|[[Interurban]]s
|The term ''interurban'' mainly refers to rail cars that run through streets like ordinary streetcars (trams), but also between cities or towns, often through rural environments. In the period 1900–1930, interurbans were very common in the US, especially in the [[Midwest]]. Some of them, like the [[Red Devil (interurban)|Red Devils]], the J. G. Brill [[Bullet (interurban)|Bullets]], and the [[Electroliner]]s, were the [[high-speed rail]]cars of their time, with an in-service speed of up to about {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. In Europe interurbans are making a comeback as &quot;[[tram-train]]s&quot; (locally known under different names) that operate on both railway and light rail tracks, often with different voltage. The [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]] is one well known example.

===Train operation===
{{Details|Automatic train operation}}
An important factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under automatic train operation (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would be there to stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Floor height===
{{Details|Low floor}}
The latest generation of LRVs has the advantage of partially or fully low-floor design, with the floor of the vehicles only {{convert|300|to|360|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} above the top of the rail, a feature not found in either rapid rail transit vehicles or streetcars. This allows them to load passengers, including those in wheelchairs or strollers, directly from low-rise platforms that are little more than raised sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive and delay-inducing wheelchair lifts, while also making boarding faster and easier for other passengers.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Power sources===
[[Overhead lines]] supply electricity to the vast majority of light rail systems. This avoids the danger of passengers stepping on an electrified [[third rail]]. The [[Docklands Light Railway]] uses an inverted third rail for its electrical power, which allows the electrified rail to be covered and the power drawn from the underside. Trams in [[Bordeaux tramway|Bordeaux]], France, use a [[Ground level power supply|special third-rail configuration]] where the power is only switched on beneath the trams, making it safe on city streets. Several systems in Europe and a few recently opened systems in North America use [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered trains.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Tram and other light rail transit systems worldwide==
{{Main|Tram and light rail transit systems|List of tram and light rail transit systems}}

Around the world there are many extant tram and streetcar systems. Some date from the beginning of the 20th century or earlier such as [[Toronto streetcar system]], but many of the original tram and streetcar systems were closed down in the mid-20th century, with the exceptions of many Eastern Europe countries. Even though many systems closed down over the years, there are still a number of tram systems that have been operating much as they did when they were first built over a century ago. Some cities (such as Los Angeles and [[Jersey City]]) that once closed down their streetcar networks are now restoring, or have already rebuilt, at least some of their former streetcar/tram systems. Most light rail services are currently committed to [[articulated vehicles]] like modern LRVs, i.e. trams, with the exception of large underground metro or rapid transit systems.

A number of UK cities have substantial light rail networks including Nottingham, [[Manchester Metrolink]] and a line between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, with plans to extend out as far as Coventry.

''Social capital'' is also distinguished from the economic theory [[social capitalism]]. Social capitalism as a theory challenges the idea that [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]] are mutually exclusive. Social capitalism posits that a strong social support network for the poor enhances capital output. By decreasing poverty, capital market participation is enlarged.

=== Forms of capital (Bourdieu) ===
In ''The Forms of Capital'', [[Pierre Bourdieu]] distinguishes between three forms of capital: [[capital (economics)|economic capital]], [[cultural capital]] and social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|author-link=Pierre Bourdieu|year=198|title=The Forms of Capital|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines ''social capital'' as &quot;the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdieu 1983&quot;&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. (1983). &quot;Ökonomisches Kapital, kulturelles Kapital, soziales Kapital&quot; in Soziale Ungleichheiten (Soziale Welt, Sonderheft 2), edited by Reinhard Kreckel. Goettingen: Otto Schartz &amp; Co. pp. 249&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the ''&quot;deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes 1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Portes|first1=Alejandro|year=1998|title=Social Capital: Its Origins and Applications in Modern Sociology|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/61090d286c2b456efbacfbbc718b1365a80ad39d|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=24|pages=1–24|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their &quot;old boys network&quot; or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children.

=== Norms of trust and reciprocity (Sander, Putnam, Coleman) ===
Thomas Sander&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tom Sander|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/saguaro/about/who-we-are/tom-sander|accessdate=2015-12-02|website=www.hks.harvard.edu|lay-source=Executive Director of the Saguaro Seminar: Civic Engagement in America, a program of the John F.

[[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]] defined social capital functionally as &quot;a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=James|date=1988|title=Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=94|pages=95–120|citeseerx=10.1.1.208.1462|doi=10.1086/228943|jstor=2780243}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or [[collective action]], generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes 1998&quot; /&gt; In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 1997&quot;&gt;Foley, M. W. &amp; Edwards, B. (1997). ''Escape from politics?''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Robert D. Putnam]], ''social capital'' refers to &quot;connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] and [[Trust (social science)|trustworthiness]] that arise from them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert D. Putnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rd2ibodep7UC&amp;pg=PA19|title=Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community|date=7 August 2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-0304-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining [[democracy]]. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. He also says that television and [[urban sprawl]] have had a significant role in making America far less 'connected'. Putnam believes that social capital can be measured by the amount of trust and &quot;reciprocity&quot; in a community or between individuals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital is [[Women in the workforce|women's entry the workforce]], which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement like [[Parent–teacher association|parent-teacher associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Putnam|first1=R. D.|year=1995|title=Bowling alone: America's declining social capital|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RGID/article/view/60809|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–78|doi=10.1353/jod.1995.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological transformation of [[leisure]] (e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D|year=2006|title=On and off the 'Net: Scales for Social Capital in an Online Era|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=11|issue=2|pages=593–628|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00029.x|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civic association (Fukuyama) ===
In &quot;Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development&quot;, political economist [[Francis Fukuyama]] defines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] or [[religious doctrine]] like [[Christianity]]. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reduce [[transaction cost]] of exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare. 

Referencing [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in ''[[Democracy in America]],'' and what he described as the '''art of association''' of the American propensity for [[Civic association|civil association]], Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces a [[civil society]]. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, &quot;one person's civic engagement is another's [[rent-seeking]].&quot; Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity.

=== Social ties ===
[[Carlos García Timón]] describes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The differences between ''weak'' and ''strong'' ties are explained by Granovetter (1973).&lt;ref name=&quot;Granovetter 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Granovetter|first1=M. S.|year=1973|title=The Strength of Weak Ties|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9aece346139711b8c65c618da99cdbecb162575|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1360–1380|doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network. Hazleton and Kennan (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Hazleton V., and W. Kennan. 2000. &quot;Social capital: reconceptualizing the bottom line.&quot; ''Corporate Communications: An International Journal'' 5(2):81–86.&lt;/ref&gt; added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict.

According to [[Max Boisot|Boisot]] (1995),&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Boisot|Boisot, Max.]] 1995. ''Information Space: A framework for learning in organizations, institutions and culture''. London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and Boland &amp; Tenkasi (1995),&lt;ref&gt;Boland and Tenkasi (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nahapiet 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nahapiet|first1=J.|last2=Ghoshal|first2=S.|year=1998|title=Social capital, intellectual capital and the organizational advantage|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=23|issue=2|pages=242–266|citeseerx=10.1.1.598.8940|doi=10.5465/amr.1998.533225|jstor=259373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative social capital ==
It has been noted that social capital may not always be used for positive ends. Social capital is often linked to the success of democracy and political involvement. [[Robert D. Putnam]] in his book ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', for example, makes the argument that social capital is linked to the recent decline in American political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert D.|date=January 1995|title=Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/DETOC/assoc/bowling.html|url-status=dead|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–78|doi=10.1353/jod.1995.0002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201190211/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/DETOC/assoc/bowling.html|archive-date=1 February 2010|access-date=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections.

Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) were the first to create figures and equate negative social capital with negative returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lester|first1=Monica|last2=Maheshwari|first2=Sharad K.|last3=McLain|first3=Michael|date=2013|title=Family Firms and Negative Social Capital: A Property Rights Theory Approach|url=http://www.ibam.com/pubs/jbam/articles/vol15/No1/article%203%20Lester%20et%20al%20after%20assistant%20ed.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Journal of Behavioral &amp; Applied Management|volume=15|issue=11|pages=11–24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208133824/http://www.ibam.com/pubs/jbam/articles/vol15/No1/article%203%20Lester%20et%20al%20after%20assistant%20ed.pdf|archive-date=8 December 2015|access-date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before them, negative social capital was a [[Social issue|societal ill]], not a business one. An example of the complexities of the effects of negative social capital is violence or criminal [[gang]] activity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ilan|first=Johnathan|date=Spring 2012|title=Street Social Capital in the Liquid City|url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/16759/1/StreetCulturalLives_deposit%20copy.pdf|journal=Ethnography|volume=14|pages=3–24|doi=10.1177/1466138112440983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated with ''bonding'' vis-à-vis ''bridging''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=Douglas D.|last2=Hughey|first2=Joseph|last3=Speer|first3=Paul W.|year=2002|title=Community Psychology Perspectives on Social Capital Theory and Community Development Practice|url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/Perkins_Hughey_Speer-JCDS-33-no1-2002.pdf|journal=Journal of the Community Development Society|volume=33|pages=33–52|doi=10.1080/15575330209490141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without &quot;bridging&quot; social capital, &quot;bonding&quot; groups can become isolated and [[Disenfranchised grief|disenfranchised]] from the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an &quot;increase&quot; in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolin|first1=B.|last2=Hackett|first2=E.J.|last3=Harlan|first3=S.L.|last4=Kirby|first4=A.|last5=Larsen|first5=L.|last6=Nelson|first6=A.|last7=Rex|first7=T.R.|last8=Wolf|year=2004|title=Bonding and Bridging: Understanding the Relationship between Social Capital and Civic Action|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f20450f4464f29fd1802bcb4f2dde9c1271229a|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=24|pages=64–77|doi=10.1177/0739456X04267181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it just isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.

=== Accessibility ===
Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of the ''[[American Behavioral Scientist]]'' on &quot;Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy&quot;, raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and [[social isolation]] limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society.

On top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital:&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes 1998&quot; /&gt;

# exclusion of outsiders;
# excess claims on group members;
# restrictions on individual freedom; and
# downward levelling norms.

=== In political institutions ===
Social capital (in the institutional [[Robert Putnam]] sense) may also lead to bad outcomes if the [[Political system|political institution]] and [[democracy]] in a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. &quot;Civil society and the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]]&quot; suggests that &quot;it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during the [[Wilhelminism|Wihelmine]] and Weimar eras.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheri Berman]],''World Politics'' 49, 3, April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. &quot;Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitate [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]].&quot; In this article about the fall of the [[Weimar Republic]], the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a &quot;joining&quot; society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed during [[World War I]], and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power.

Additionally, in his essay &quot;A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shindler|first=Michael|title=A Criticism of Putnam’s Theory of Social Capital|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419030009/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|archive-date=19 April 2015|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a &quot;we&quot; instead of an &quot;I&quot; mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are &quot;horizontally&quot; structured and which were also common to pre-[[soviet]] [[eastern europe]], will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419030009/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/analysis-social-capital-approach/|archive-date=19 April 2015|accessdate=6 April 2015|website=The Apollonian Revolt|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In race and ethnicity ===
Using a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Franz|year=2009|title=Social Capital of Economic Clusters: Towards a Network-Based Conception of Social Resources|url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/201627/1/Franz_Huber_TESG_final.doc|journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie|volume=100|issue=2|pages=160–170|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9663.2009.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms among [[African Americans|African-American]] family firms and [[European Americans|Euro-American]] family firms, Lester et al noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

[[Robert Putnam]], in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth of [[public trust]] are inhibited by immigration and rising racial [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam|Putnam, Robert D.]] 2006. ''E Pluribus Unim: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-First Century,'' Nordic Political Science Association&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (USA) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high ([[Eastern Europe]]), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be.  Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|date=2015|title=Construction, Robustness Assessment and Application of an Index of Perceived Level of Socio-economic Threat from Immigrants: A Study of 47 European Countries and Regions|journal=Social Indicators Research|volume=128|pages=413–437|doi=10.1007/s11205-015-1037-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (''bridging'') versus intra-ethnic ones (''bonding'') on [[ethnic violence]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Varshney&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Varshney|first1=Ashutosh|year=2001|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society: India and Beyond|journal=World Politics|volume=53|issue=3|pages=362–398|doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0012|jstor=25054154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashutosh Varshney: Home|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/varshney/home|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016072429/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/varshney/home|archive-date=16 October 2015|access-date=10 October 2012|website=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.
Three main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth:&lt;ref name=&quot;Varshney&quot; /&gt;
# Facilitate communication in the community across ethnic lines
# Squelch false rumors
# Help the administration carry out its job and in particular peace, security and justice

This is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] understanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the &quot;[[self-policing]]&quot;{{dn|date=November 2020}} mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996)&lt;ref name=&quot;Fearon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fearon|first1=James|last2=Laitin|first2=David|year=1996|title=Explaining Inter-Ethnic Cooperation|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bbc601a4b668fdce670da07411d96a3be3acb17|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=90|issue=4|pages=715–735|doi=10.2307/2945838|jstor=2945838}}&lt;/ref&gt; may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement.

=== Social inequality ===
[[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]] (1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation of [[human capital]] for the future generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt; '''Human capital''', a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;John Field, 2003. ''Social Capital''&lt;/ref&gt; While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit. 

Even though Coleman never truly addresses [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth in ''Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture''. Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of their ''[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'' being enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital.

According to Bourdieu, '''habitus''' refers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays his or her habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or more [[Agency (sociology)|social actors]]. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to become [[Social mobility|socially mobile]], he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Positive consequences of social capital ==
Compared to Bourdieu, [[Robert D. Putnam]] has used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating &quot;whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 1997&quot; /&gt; his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of &quot;[[civic engagement]]&quot; and also a broad societal measure of communal health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessandrini 2002&quot;&gt;Alessandrini, M. (2002). ''Is Civil Society an Adequate Theory?''&lt;/ref&gt; He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks.

Mahyar Arefi (2003) identifies [[consensus]]-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arefi|first1=M|year=2003|title=Revisiting the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative (LANI): Lessons for Planners|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ab83ae198126ed1f94bf7e7d5dd052704022acfa|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=22|issue=4|page=384|doi=10.1177/0739456x03022004005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus implies &quot;shared interest&quot; and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action. ''[[Collective action]]'' is thus an indicator of increased social capital.

== Subtypes ==

=== Bonding, bridging, linking ===
In ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'' (2000), Harvard political scientist [[Robert D. Putnam]] writes:&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam 2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Henry Ward Beecher]]'s advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America – though it will be – but because it will be good for us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal:

# '''Bonding social capital''': the value assigned to social networks between homogeneous groups of people.
# '''Bridging social capital''': the value assigned to social networks between socially heterogeneous groups.

Typical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, while [[choir]]s and bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaidHoltz-Bacha2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynda Lee Kaid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCd1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT106|title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|author2=Christina Holtz-Bacha|date=21 December 2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6562-9|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes to [[societal]] interests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society.

Similar to Putnam, [[Daniel P. Aldrich]] describes three mechanisms of social capital:

# '''Bonding capital''': the relationships a person has with friends and family, making it also the strongest form of social capital. 
# '''Bridging capital''': the relationship between friends of friends, making its strength secondary to bonding capital.
# '''Linking capital''': the relationship between a person and a government official or other elected leader.

Aldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles of [[disaster recovery]], and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his book ''Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery'', he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel P. Aldrich|Aldrich, Daniel P.]]  2012. ''Building resilience: Social capital in post-disaster recovery''. [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Social capital development on the internet via social networking websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Myspace]] tends to be bridging capital according to one study, though &quot;virtual&quot; social capital is a new area of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N. B., Steinfield, C., &amp; Lampe, C. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consummatory, instrumental ===
There are two other sub-sources of social capital:&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes p. 7-8&quot;&gt;Portes p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Consummatory capital''': a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. 
#* Examples include value interjection and solidarity.
# '''Instrumental capital''': behavior that is taught through ones surroundings over time.

==== Consummatory capital ====
Consummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes p. 7-8&quot; /&gt;

'''Value interjection''' pertains to a person or community who fulfills obligations such as paying bills on time, [[philanthropy]], and following the rules of society. People who live their life this way feel that these are norms of society and are able to live their lives free of worry for their credit, children, and receive charity if needed. 

Coleman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe.&lt;ref&gt;Portes p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of '''solidarity''' may be traced to 19th century [[socialism|socialist]] thinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes p. 7-8&quot; /&gt; As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes p. 8&quot;&gt;Portes p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

While the notion of ''solidarity as social capital'' is sometimes attributed to [[Karl Marx]], in particular, the term ''social capital'' had a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of &quot;capital&quot; were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell their [[labour power]], because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw &quot;social capital&quot; as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed within in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete &quot;individual capital.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1885-c2/ch18.htm Karl Marx, 1885, ''Capital Volume II, Part III: The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital, Chapter 18: Introduction I. The Subject Investigated''], (24 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Instrumental capital ====
Instrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one's surroundings over time. The basis of this category of social capital is that an individual who donates his or her resources not because he is seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but because they are part of the same social structure. By his or her donation, the individual might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portes p. 8&quot; /&gt; 

The best example of this, and the one that Portes mentions, is the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group. The donor is not freely giving up his resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community.  With this in mind, the recipient might not know the benefactor personally, but he or she prospers on the sole factor that he or she is a member of the same social group.&lt;ref&gt;Portes p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents important aspect of social capital ([[religious social capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Sadłoń: Religijny kapitał społeczny. Saabrucken: Bezkresy Wiedzy, 2014, s. 297. {{ISBN|978-3-639-89111-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale), [[Quantitative research|quantitative measuring]] has proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Carl L. Bankston]] and [[Min Zhou]] have argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges across [[Level of analysis|levels of analysis]] as individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of &quot;capital&quot; may be misleading because, unlike [[financial capital]], which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms of [[social organization]] are not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bankston|first1=Carl L.|last2=Zhou|first2=Min|year=2002|title=Social Capital as Process: The Meanings and Problems of a Theoretical Metaphor?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7577cb9b1bd92791c2966d3926f3f624d35bf9de|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=72|issue=2|pages=285–317|doi=10.1111/1475-682x.00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name generators ===
One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as &quot;Name all the people you've discussed important matters within the past six months.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Peter V.|date=1987-01-01|title=Core Discussion Networks of Americans|jstor=2095397|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=1|pages=122–131|doi=10.2307/2095397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties.

=== Social capital scales ===
Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: &quot;do you trust the others?&quot; Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities.

To expand upon the [[Methodology|methodological]] potential of measuring [[online and offline]] social bonding, as it relates to social capital,&lt;ref&gt;Williams (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=8554118995697847065&amp;as_sdt=205&amp;sciodt=0,1&amp;hl=en|title=- Google Scholar|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin, Peng, Kim, Kim &amp; LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms like [[Facebook]] provide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may be [[Operationalization|operationalized]] to understand strategies for coping with [[cross-cultural]] immersion through online engagement.

=== Cohesion measures ===
The level of [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]] of a group also affects its social capital and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320656629|title=Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2018-01-01|pages=1–22|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-60627-9_1|chapter=Introduction: Civil Society, Public Debate and Natural Resource Management|isbn=978-3-319-60626-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/PerkinsLong.2002.Neighborhood_sense_of_communitysocial_capital.pdf|title=Perkins, D.D., &amp; Long, D.A. (2002). Neighborhood sense of community and social capital: A multi-level analysis. In A. Fisher, C. Sonn, &amp; B. Bishop (Eds.), Psychological sense of community: Research, applications, and implications (pp. 291-318). New York: Plenum|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity.

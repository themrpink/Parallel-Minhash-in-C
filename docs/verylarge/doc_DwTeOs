=== White City ===
[[Image:World Columbian Exposition - White City - 1.JPG|thumb|left|White City]]
Most of the buildings of the fair were designed in the [[neoclassical architecture]] style. The area at the Court of Honor was known as '''The White City'''. Façades were made not of stone, but of a mixture of plaster, cement, and jute fiber called [[Staff (building material)|staff]], which was painted white, giving the buildings their &quot;gleam.”  Architecture critics derided the structures as &quot;decorated sheds.” The buildings were clad in white [[stucco]], which, in comparison to the [[tenement]]s of Chicago, seemed illuminated. It was also called the White City because of the extensive use of street lights, which made the boulevards and buildings usable at night.

In 1892, working under extremely tight deadlines to complete construction, director of works Daniel Burnham appointed [[Francis Davis Millet]] to replace the fair's official director of color-design, William Pretyman. Pretyman had resigned following a dispute with Burnham. After experimenting, Millet settled on a mix of oil and white lead [[whitewash]] that could be applied using compressed air [[spray paint]]ing to the buildings, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;/&gt; Joseph Binks, maintenance supervisor at Chicago's [[Marshall Field's Wholesale Store]], who had been using this method to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store, got the job to paint the Exposition buildings.&lt;ref&gt;finishingacademy.com, 1.1.1 The History of the Spray Booth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyshopbusiness.com/the-history-of-sprayguns/|title=The History of Sprayguns – Body Shop Business|date=1 September 2000|access-date=2016-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904164125/http://www.bodyshopbusiness.com/the-history-of-sprayguns/|archive-date=2016-09-04|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims this was the first use of spray painting may be apocryphal since journals from that time note this form of painting had already been in use in the railroad industry from the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/November-2011/The-Contentious-Historical-Origins-Spray-Paint/|title=The Contentious Historical Origins of Spray Paint|access-date=2016-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719143105/http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/November-2011/The-Contentious-Historical-Origins-Spray-Paint/|archive-date=2018-07-19|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the buildings included sculptural details and, to meet the Exposition's opening deadline, chief architect Burnham sought the help of [[Chicago Art Institute]] instructor [[Lorado Taft]] to help complete them. Taft's efforts included employing a group of talented women sculptors from the Institute known as &quot;the [[White Rabbits (sculptors)|White Rabbits]]&quot; to finish some of the buildings, getting their name from Burnham's comment &quot;Hire anyone, even white rabbits if they'll do the work.&quot;

==== White City controversy ====

[[File:Dahomey Village--On The Midway — Official Views Of The World's Columbian Exposition — 110.jpg|thumb|right|Apart from official nation displays, non-white cultures were largely excluded from the main park and were instead found on the Midway.]]

According to [[University of Notre Dame]] history professor Gail Bederman, White City sparked considerable controversy. In her 1995 text ''Manliness and Civilization'', she writes, &quot;The White City, with its vision of future perfection and of the advanced racial power of manly commerce and technology, constructed civilization as an ideal of white male power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bederman |first1=Gail |title=Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880-1917 |date=November 1, 1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226041391 |page=35-40 |edition=1 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Manliness_and_Civilization/KVtKszMHWbcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover |access-date=30 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bederman, people of color were barred entirely from participating in the organization of the White City and were instead given access only to the Midway exhibit, &quot;which specialized in spectacles of barbarous races - 'authentic' villages of Samoans, Egyptians, Dahomans, Turks, and other exotic peoples, populated by actual imported 'natives.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt;

Two small exhibits were included in the White City's &quot;Woman's Building&quot; which addressed women of color. One, entitled &quot;Afro-American&quot; was installed in a distant corner of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt;  The other, called &quot;Woman's Work in Savagery,&quot; included baskets, weavings, and African, Polynesian, and Native American arts. Though they were produced by living women of color, the materials were represented as relics from the distant past, embodying &quot;the work of white women's own distant evolutionary foremothers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt; 

In response to these failings, civil rights leaders [[Ida B. Wells]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Irvine Garland Penn]], and Ferdinand Lee Barnet wrote and circulated a pamphlet at the exposition titled ''[https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/wells/exposition/exposition.html The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition]'', which argued the exposition organizers had deliberately excluded African Americans from the White City in order &quot;to shame the Negro.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt; By only allowing Black people to be featured in &quot;Midway,&quot; Wells and Douglass argued, &quot;the Dahomians are also here to exhibit the Negro as a repulsive savage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt; Ten thousand copies of the pamphlet were circulated in the White City from the Haitian Embassy (where Douglass had been selected as its national representative), and the activists received responses from the delegations of England, Germany, France, Russia, and India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manliness and Civilization&quot; /&gt;

==== Role in the City Beautiful Movement ====
[[File:The great white city, World's Columbian Exposition, by Kilburn, B. W. (Benjamin West), 1827-1909.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Great White City&quot;]]

The White City is largely credited for ushering in the [[City Beautiful movement]] and planting the seeds of modern city planning.  The highly integrated design of the landscapes, promenades, and structures provided a vision of what is possible when planners, landscape architects, and architects work together on a comprehensive design scheme.

The White City inspired cities to focus on the beautification of the components of the city in which municipal government had control; streets, municipal art, public buildings, and public spaces. The designs of the City Beautiful Movement (closely tied with the municipal art movement) are identifiable by their classical architecture, plan symmetry, picturesque views, and axial plans, as well as their magnificent scale.  Where the municipal art movement focused on beautifying one feature in a city, the City Beautiful movement began to make improvements on the scale of the district. The White City of the World's Columbian Exposition inspired the [[Merchants Club]] of Chicago to commission [[Daniel Burnham]] to create the Plan of Chicago in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, John M. (2009) Contemporary Urban Planning.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great buildings===

There were fourteen main &quot;great buildings&quot;&lt;ref name=DCS/&gt;{{rp|17}} centered around a giant reflective pool called the Grand Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Visions of America: A History of the United States Since 1865|last = Keene|first = Jennifer|publisher = Pearson|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0205251636|location = London|pages = 508, 510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings included:
* The Administration Building, designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]]
* The Agricultural Building, designed by [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] of [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]]
* The Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building, designed by [[George B. Post]]. If this building were standing today, it would rank second in volume and third in footprint on [[list of largest buildings]] (130,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 8,500,000m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=devil/&gt; It exhibited works related to literature, science, art and music.
* The Mines and Mining Building, designed by [[Solon Spencer Beman]]
* The Electricity Building, designed by [[Henry Van Brunt]] and Frank Maynard Howe
* The Machinery Hall, designed by [[Robert Swain Peabody]] of Peabody and Stearns
* [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|The Woman's Building]], designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]]

* Anthropology Building designed by [[Charles B. Atwood]]

===Transportation Building===
[[File:The Gilded Entrance to the Transportation Building (3405437784).jpg|thumb|Golden Arch at [[Louis Sullivan]]'s Transportation Building]]
[[Louis Sullivan]]'s polychrome proto-Modern Transportation Building was an outstanding exception to the prevailing style, as he tried to develop an organic American form. Years later, in 1922, he wrote that the classical style of the White City had set back modern American architecture by forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Louis (1924). ''Autobiography of an Idea''. New York City: Press of the American institute of Architects, Inc.. p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

As detailed in [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s popular history ''[[The Devil in the White City]]'', extraordinary effort was required to accomplish the exposition, and much of it was unfinished on opening day. The famous [[Ferris Wheel]], which proved to be a major attendance draw and helped save the fair from bankruptcy, was not finished until June, because of waffling by the board of directors the previous year on whether to build it. Frequent debates and disagreements among the developers of the fair added many delays. The spurning of [[Buffalo Bill]]'s Wild West Show proved a serious financial mistake.  Buffalo Bill set up his highly popular show next door to the fair and brought in a great deal of revenue that he did not have to share with the developers. Nonetheless, construction and operation of the fair proved to be a windfall for Chicago workers during the serious economic recession that was sweeping the country.&lt;ref name=devil/&gt;

Almost all of the fair's structures were designed to be temporary; of the more than 200 buildings erected for the fair, the only two which still stand in place are the [[Palace of Fine Arts, Chicago|Palace of Fine Arts]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|World's Congress Auxiliary Building]]. From the time the fair closed until 1920, the Palace of Fine Arts housed the Field Columbian Museum (now the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], since relocated); in 1933 (having been completely rebuilt in permanent materials), the Palace building re-opened as the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msichicago.org/explore/about-us/museum-facts/ About The Museum – Museum History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408184848/http://www.msichicago.org/explore/about-us/museum-facts |date=2016-04-08 }} – [[Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago]], USA&lt;/ref&gt;  The second building, the World's Congress Building, was one of the few buildings not built in Jackson Park, instead it was built downtown in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. The cost of construction of the World's Congress Building was shared with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which, as planned, moved into the building (the museum's current home) after the close of the fair.

The three other significant buildings that survived the fair represented Norway, the Netherlands, and the State of Maine. The [[Norway]] Building was a recreation of a traditional wooden [[stave church]]. After the Fair it was relocated to Lake Geneva, and in 1935 was moved to a museum called [[Little Norway, Wisconsin|Little Norway]] in [[Blue Mounds, Wisconsin]]. In 2015 it was dismantled and shipped back to Norway, where it was restored and reassembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/the-journey-for-the-norway-building-comes-full-circle/article_e0a3ae2e-034b-58b9-8de3-dfc972bf41e7.html|title=The journey for the Norway Building comes full circle|last=Journal|first=Barry Adams {{!}} Wisconsin State|work=madison.com|access-date=2018-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709172126/https://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/the-journey-for-the-norway-building-comes-full-circle/article_e0a3ae2e-034b-58b9-8de3-dfc972bf41e7.html|archive-date=2018-07-09|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the [[Maine State Building]], designed by Charles Sumner Frost, which was purchased by the Ricker family of [[Poland Spring, Maine]]. They moved the building to their resort to serve as a library and art gallery. The Poland Spring Preservation Society now owns the building, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. The third is [[The Dutch House (Brookline, Massachusetts)|The Dutch House]], which was moved to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

The [[Viking (replica Viking longship)|1893 Viking ship]] that was sailed to the Exposition from Norway by Captain Magnus Andersen, is located in [[Geneva, Illinois]]. The ship is open to visitors on scheduled days April through October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikingship.us|title=Friends of the Viking Ship|access-date=2018-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011214705/http://www.vikingship.us/|archive-date=2018-10-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main altar at [[St. John Cantius in Chicago]], as well as its matching two side altars, are reputed to be from the Columbian Exposition.

Since many of the other buildings at the fair were intended to be temporary, they were removed after the fair. The White City so impressed visitors (at least before air pollution began to darken the façades) that plans were considered to refinish the exteriors in marble or some other material. These plans were abandoned in July 1894, when much of the fair grounds was destroyed in a fire.

==Visitors==
[[Helen Keller]], along with her mentor [[Anne Sullivan]] and Dr. [[Alexander Graham Bell]], visited the fair in summer of 1893. Keller described the fair in her autobiography ''[[The Story of My Life (biography)|The Story of My Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Story of My Life.|url = http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/life.html|website = digital.library.upenn.edu |access-date = 2016-01-03|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114165042/http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/life.html|archive-date = 2016-01-14|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in July, a [[Wellesley College]] English teacher named [[Katharine Lee Bates]] visited the fair. The White City later inspired the reference to &quot;alabaster cities&quot; in her poem and lyrics &quot;[[America the Beautiful]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falmouthhistoricalsociety.org/05/klbates.htm &quot;Falmouth Museums on the Green&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123112337/http://www.falmouthhistoricalsociety.org/05/klbates.htm |date=2009-01-23 }}, Falmouth Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was extensively reported by Chicago publisher [[William D.

He departed from [[Persia]] on April 20, 1892, especially for the purpose of visiting the World's Columbian Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;Muʿīn al-Salṭana, Muḥammad ʿAlī (Hāǧǧ Mīrzā), Safarnāma-yi Šīkāgū : ḵāṭirāt-i Muḥammad ʿAlī Muʿīn al-Salṭana bih Urūpā wa Āmrīkā : 1310 Hiǧrī-yi Qamarī / bih kūšiš-i Humāyūn Šahīdī, [Tihrān] : Intišrāt-i ʿIlmī, 1984, 1363/[1984].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Coubertin]] visited the fair with his friends [[Paul Bourget]] and [[Samuel Jean de Pozzi]]. He devotes the first chapter of his book &quot; Souvenirs d'Amérique et de Grèce &quot; (1897) to the visit. [[Swami Vivekananda]] visited the fair to attend the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] and delivered his famous speech &quot;Sisters and Brothers of America!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/05/sisters-and-brothers-of-america.html|title=Sisters And Brothers Of America|website=www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org|access-date=2016-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022153943/http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/05/sisters-and-brothers-of-america.html|archive-date=2016-10-22|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kubota Beisen]] was an official delegate of Japan.

==Souvenirs==
[[File:Worldsfairticket.jpg|thumb|Ticket for Chicago Day]]
Examples of exposition souvenirs can be found in various American museum collections.  One example, copyrighted in 1892 by John W. Green, is a folding [[hand fan]] with detailed illustrations of landscapes and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fan|url=https://statenisland.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/7684D459-5C2E-412F-BB18-191850529052|work=Online Collections Database|publisher=Staten Island Historical Society|access-date=6 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916050938/https://statenisland.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/7684D459-5C2E-412F-BB18-191850529052|archive-date=2017-09-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles W Goldsmith produced a set of ten postcard designs, each in full colour, showing the buildings constructed for the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willoughby|first1=Martin|title=A History of Postcards|date=1992|publisher=Bracken Books|location=London England|isbn=1858911621|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbian Exposition coins were also minted for the event.

== Electricity ==
[[File:Agricultural Building at Night (3409426351).jpg|thumb|Electricity was used to decorate the buildings with incandescent lights, illuminate fountains, and power three huge spotlights.]]
The effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] and the [[alternating current]] system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the [[War of the currents]] between DC and AC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6cWRxU9go4C&amp;q=westinghouse+World%27s+Columbian+Exposition&amp;pg=PR21|title=The World's Columbian Exposition|access-date=2015-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616192038/https://books.google.com/books?id=F6cWRxU9go4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;dq=westinghouse+World's+Columbian+Exposition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RPv2T5mzG8mQ0QHFj7nqBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=westinghouse%20World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition&amp;f=false|archive-date=2016-06-16|url-status=live|isbn=9780313266447|last1=Bertuca|first1=David J.|last2=Hartman|first2=Donald K.|last3=Neumeister|first3=Susan M.|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Moran 2007, page 97&quot;&gt;Richard Moran (2007) ''Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair'', [[Knopf Doubleday]], page 97&lt;/ref&gt; Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] to form [[General Electric]], put in a US$1.72 million bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with [[direct current]]. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Moran 2007, page 97&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=QRS&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, ''George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius'', pages 135-137&lt;/ref&gt; Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man &quot;stopper&quot; lamp patent they already had. The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.&lt;ref name=QRS/&gt;{{rp|140}} Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Davis (2012) ''Fleet Fire: Thomas Edison and the Pioneers of the Electric Revolution'', [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Chapter 8: The Manufacture and the Magus&lt;/ref&gt; They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.&lt;ref name=QRS/&gt;{{rp|142}}

The International Exposition was held in an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits. A statue of [[Benjamin Franklin]] was displayed at the entrance. The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[kinetoscope]], [[search light]]s, a [[seismograph]], electric [[incubator (egg)|incubator]]s for chicken eggs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/e_court.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310044812/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/e_court.html |archive-date=2017-03-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morse code]] [[telegraph]].&lt;ref name=DCS/&gt;{{rp|22}}

All the exhibits were from commercial enterprises. Participants included General Electric, Brush, [[Western Electric]], and Westinghouse. The Westinghouse Company displayed several [[polyphase system]]s. The exhibits included a [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]], [[polyphase system|polyphase]] generators, step-up [[transformer]]s, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size [[induction motor]]s and [[synchronous motor]]s, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor). The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.

The exposition was one influence leading to the rise of the [[City Beautiful movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Talen, Emily  (2005).''New Urbanism and American Planning: The Conflict of Cultures'', p. 118. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-70133-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Results included grand buildings and fountains built around [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmstedian]] parks, shallow pools of water on axis to central buildings, larger park systems, broad boulevards and parkways and, after the start of the 20th century, zoning laws and planned suburbs.  Examples of the City Beautiful movement's works include the City of Chicago, the [[Columbia University]] campus, and the [[National Mall]] in Washington D.C.

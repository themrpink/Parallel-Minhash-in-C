====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Education: Political Issues in Britain and Europe|last=Meredith|first=Philip|year=1989|pages=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boethius|first=Carl|year=1986|title=Sex Education in Swedish Schools: The Facts and the Fiction|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=17|issue=6|pages=276–279|doi=10.2307/2135318|jstor=2135318|pmid=3842667}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;swedsexed&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978575-2,00.html Sex Has Many Accents] ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Association for Sexuality Education]] (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes &quot;sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanem|first=Torkild|year=2010|title=Free At Last?

Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], the content and amount of sex education is decided at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level. In [[Geneva]], courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gentiane Burgermeister, Education sexuelle en milieu scolaire, l’expérience genevoise; '' Int. J. Pub. Health, (1972) 17; 1; 53-57''.&lt;/ref&gt; In most French-speaking cantons since the '70s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the '80s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on whom to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feeling about a situation and say &quot;No&quot;. In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16–17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of ''Santé sexuelle Suisse'' - the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

=====England and Wales=====
[[Cecil Reddie]] ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at [[Abbotsholme School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hammill&quot;/&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], Sex and relationship education (&lt;abbr&gt;[[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]]&lt;/abbr&gt;) is currently compulsory, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn't promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationship education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects|title=The national curriculum: Other compulsory subjects - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools actively choose to deliver age appropriate relationship and sex education from [[Early Years Foundation Stage]], which include the differences between boys and girls, naming body parts, what areas of the body are private and should not be touched unless the child is happy and gives consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigtalkeducation.co.uk/working-with-primaries.html|title=BigTalk Education RSE in Primary Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/opinion/children-taught-sex-ed-age-four-11/|title=What children should be taught in sex education from age four to 11|date=2017-12-14|work=iNews|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education programme in [[Scotland]] is ''Healthy Respect'', which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the [[Scottish Government]], the programme ''Called to Love'' focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |title=Cardinal praises &quot;dedication and commitment&quot; of Catholic teachers |publisher=Scmo.org |date=April 30, 2008 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620082038/http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |archive-date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Sex education in the United States}}

Almost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics in grades 5 or 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David J. Landry |author2=Susheela Singh |author3=Jacqueline E.

Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes and contain provisions to allow parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaiser 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |title=Sex Education in the U.S.: Policy and Politics |access-date=May 23, 2007 |date=October 2002 |work=Issue Update |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028081547/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Sex%20Education%20in%20the%20US%20%20%20%20Policy%20and%20Politics.pdf |archive-date=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, [[HIV]], [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]]s, [[abstinence]], implications of [[teenage pregnancy]], and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about [[abortion]], varied more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author2=Jacqueline E.

Only two forms of sex education are taught in American schools: &quot;abstinence plus&quot; and &quot;[[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|author2=David W.

A 2002 study conducted by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as &quot;abstinence plus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaiser 2002&quot;/&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only.

Among 48 of the 50 U.S. states (the exceptions were [[North Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]]) in their 2005 state laws and policies, 21 stressed abstinence-only sexual education and 7 emphasized that abstinence should be taught in their state's sexual education programs. Only 11 states require that students receive both comprehensive and abstinence education and 9 states did not mention any sort of sexual education in their laws and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stanger-Hall|first1=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|pmc=3194801|pmid=22022362|pages=e24658|year=2011|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624658S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject.

On the other hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex education object to curricula that fail to teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality which is based on sex only within the bounds of marriage is &quot;healthy and constructive&quot; and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs.&lt;ref&gt;

The impact of the rise in abstinence-only education remains a question. To date, no published studies of abstinence-only programs have found consistent and significant program effects on delaying the onset of intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advocates for Youth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/stateevaluations/index.htm |title=Five Years of Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Education: Assessing the Impact  |access-date=May 23, 2007 |last=Hauser |first=Debra |year=2004  |publisher=Advocates for Youth |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070428065800/http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/stateevaluations/index.htm |archive-date = April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle school students who took part in abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study: Abstinence programs no guarantee |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/04/13/abstinence.study.ap/index.html?eref=rss_education |work=CNN.com |agency=Associated Press |date=April 14, 2007 |access-date=April 18, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title =Mathematica Findings Too Narrow | publisher =National Abstinence Education Association | date =April 13, 2007 | url =http://www.abstinenceassociation.org/newsroom/pr_041307_mathematica.html | access-date =May 25, 2007 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070517214531/http://www.abstinenceassociation.org/newsroom/pr_041307_mathematica.html | archive-date =May 17, 2007 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anna Mulrine of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', records show that professionals still do not know which method of sex education works best to keep teens from engaging in sexual activity, but they are still working to find out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=Risky Business|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=May 27, 2002|pages=42–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Virginia=====
[[Virginia]] uses the sex education program called The National Campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/|title=Sitemap|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Campaign was created in 1996 and focuses on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies of young adults. The National Campaign set a goal to reduce teen pregnancy rate by 1/3 in 10 years. The Virginia Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/|title=Virginia Department of Health|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Virginia 19th in teen pregnancy birth rates in 1996. Virginia was also rated 35.2 teen births per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 in 2006. The Healthy people 2010 goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/|title=Healthy People 2020|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a teen pregnancy rate at or below 43 pregnancies per 1,000 females age 15–17.

=====Texas=====
Sex education in [[Texas]] has recently become a policy of much focus in the state. With the rise of recent protests and proposed bills in the Texas House, the current policy has been the focus of much scrutiny. As of 1997, when Senate Bill 1 was enacted, Texas has left the decision of inclusion of sex education classes within schools up to the individual districts. The school board members are entitled to approve all curricula that are taught; however the bill has certain criteria that a school must abide by when choosing to teach Sex Ed. These include:
* present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity for unmarried persons of school age;
* devote more attention to abstinence from sexual activity than to any other behavior;
* emphasize that abstinence from sexual activity, if used consistently and correctly, is the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and the emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity;
* direct adolescents to a standard of behavior in which abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and infection with HIV or AIDS;  and
* teach contraception and condom use in terms of real-world failure rates, not statistics based on laboratory rates, if instruction on contraception and condoms is included in curriculum content.

Additionally, school districts are not authorized to distribute condoms in connection with instruction relating to human sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.28.htm#28.004 |title=EDUCATION CODE CHAPTER 28. COURSES OF STUDY; ADVANCEMENT |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of this policy, several research studies have been done to evaluate the Sex Ed Policy, namely the ''abstinence-only'' aspect of the teaching. Drs. David Wiley and Kelly Wilson published the ''Just Say Don't Know: Sexuality Education in Texas Public Schools''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401062410/http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; report where they found that:
*Shaming and fear-based instruction are commonly used for teaching sex ed
*Gender stereotypes are promoted
*A majority of students receive no information about human sexuality except abstinence
*The materials used regularly contain factual errors and distort the truth about condoms and STDs

According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, &quot;We have a responsibility to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake,&quot; Villarreal said. &quot;We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas as a result of our sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=123 |title=Texas House of Representatives : Representative Villarreal, Mike |publisher=House.state.tx.us |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.
*SB 852/HB 1624&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Texas Senate Media Services |url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |title=The Texas State Senate – Rodney Ellis Press Releases |publisher=Senate.state.tx.us |date=February 23, 2011 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008224026/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist13/pr11/p022311a.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – In Feb 2011, Senator Ellis proposed The Education Works bill. This bill would require schools that teach sex education to provide evidence-based, age-appropriate information that emphasizes the importance of abstinence as the only 100% effective method of avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, while also teaching about contraceptive methods to avoid STIs and pregnancy.
*HB 741/SB 515&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/pdf/HB00741I.pdf|title=A bill to be entitled|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; – In 2011, Representatives Joaquin Castro and Mike Villarreal introduced a bill calling for abstinence-plus sexual health education bill. The bill would have medically accurate information, including: abstinence, contraception, and what it really takes to be a parent. The bill received a hearing but was left in committee.
*HB 1567/ SB 1076&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=HB1567 |title=Texas Legislature Online – 81(R) Text for HB 1567 |publisher=Capitol.state.tx.us |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Introduced in 2009 by Villarreal, this bill would have required instruction on contraceptive use to be scientifically accurate when it is taught as part of a school's sexual health curriculum. It did not receive a hearing.
Scientific evidence accumulated over many decades clearly demonstrates that the abstinence-only-until-married (AOUM) curriculum taught in Texas schools is harmful and ineffective in reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate in Texas. Despite these facts, recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, AOUM programs continue to be funded by the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government has spent more than $2 billion over the last 20 years to prohibit much-needed sex education in public schools, choosing instead to fund the AOUM curriculum while the adolescent pregnancy rates continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people|title=Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs Are Ineffective and Harmful to Young People, Expert Review Confirms|date=2017-08-14|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic schools in Texas follow Catholic Church teachings in regard to Sex Education. Some opponents of sex education in Catholic schools believe sex ed programs are doing more harm to the young than good. Opponents of sex education contend that children are not mentally and emotionally ready for this type of instruction, and believe that exposing the young to sex ed programs may foster the students with the preoccupation of sex.

The Catholic Church believes that parents are the first educators and should rightfully fight for their duty as such in regard to sex education:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMESCHL/SECATHSC.HTM |title=Sex Education And Catholic Schools |publisher=Ewtn.com |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = J.

====Australia====
The [[Government of Victoria]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Health and Human Relations Education |access-date=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979 to 1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations' Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approx. age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approx. age 5).&lt;ref name=&quot;NZMoE&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Sexuality Education: Revised Guide for Principals, Boards of Trustees, and Teachers |author= Ministry of Education |year= 2002 |location= Wellington |publisher= Learning Media |isbn= 0478267274 |url= http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |access-date= June 26, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121051529/http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health / ''Hauora'' curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum / ''Te Matauranga o Aotearoa'' (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and [[state-integrated school]]s must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |title= Section 60B: Consultation about treatment of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |title= Section 25AA: Release from tuition in specified parts of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZMoE&quot; /&gt;

==Morality==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument amongst parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views on Sex- And Sex Education- Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristen|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[James W. Prescott]], holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual [[mores]]. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized [[sexual oppression]] and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of &quot;Reid About Sex&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reidaboutsex.com/|title=ReidAboutSex — Sex and Relationship Expert Reid Mihalko's official site|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihalko|first=Reid|title=About Reid|url=http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|work=Reid About Sex|access-date=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of [[modesty]] or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as [[homosexuality]] or [[premarital sex]]. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shackelford, Katherine Grace, 1986- author.|title=Abstinence discourses, practices and sexual literacy at a small, Christian church in Central Texas|oclc=1099182508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on [[abstinence]].&lt;ref&gt;PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion &amp; Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] Accessed December 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT sex education==
{{Main|LGBT sex education}}
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; LGBT sex education includes inclusive teaching of safe sex practices for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] individuals and general instruction in topics related to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Formby&quot;/&gt; Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosciw|first=J.G.|year=2012|title=The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in our nation's schools|journal=Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |access-date=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Robert|year=2013|title=Build a curriculum that includes everyone: ensuring that schools are more accepting of LGBT students and issues requires more than passing mentions of diversity in sex education classes|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A320848233&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=lom_umichanna&amp;authCount=1#|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=94|issue=5|doi=10.1177/003172171309400506|s2cid=144659807}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up  Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from [[Primary school|Primary School]] age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|title=Pamela Sheridan Award|date=2013-04-24|work=FPA|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012074138/https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|archive-date=October 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

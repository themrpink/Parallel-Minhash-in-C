[[File:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|upright|A block diagram of an ATM]]

An ATM is typically made up of the following devices:
* [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices)
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] or [[chip card]] reader (to identify the customer)
* a [[PIN pad]] for accepting and encrypting [[personal identification number]] EPP4 (similar in layout to a [[touch tone]] or [[calculator]] keypad), manufactured as part of a secure enclosure
* [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure
* Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction)
* [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction)
* Record printer (to provide the customer with a record of the transaction)
* [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access)
* Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to)
* Sensors and indicators

Due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of [[personal computer]]â€“like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.

Business owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.

New ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |title=Summary of New 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ATM Standards |publisher=firstdata.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611031808/http://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmdepot.com/discarding-atms/ |title=How to Properly Dispose of Decommissioned ATM |publisher=ATMDepot.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308045303/http://www.atmdepot.com/discarding-atms/ |archivedate=8 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. [[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault.

Mechanisms found inside the vault may include:
* Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value)
* Deposit mechanism including a cheque processing module and bulk note acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits)
* Security sensors (magnetic, thermal, seismic, gas)
* Locks (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault)
* Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on in-house standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of notes dispensed, etc. This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability.

ATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |title=ATM ATM Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Atmdepot.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019065405/http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |archivedate=19 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry standard vault configurations include [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [[UL-291]] &quot;Business Hours&quot; and Level 1 Safes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |title=Scope for UL 291 |publisher=Ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com |date=2004-12-21 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105114749/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |archivedate=5 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RAL (standards institute)|RAL]] TL-30 derivatives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122113838/http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/13.310.htm|title=Home }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |title=BSI: Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment &amp; Certification |publisher=Bsonline.bsi-global.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012163647/http://bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fixcash.se/en/service/manuals/07100-00008F_(9100UsrMan(5.0)).pdf |title=Triton Systems &amp;#124; ATM manufacturer |publisher=Tritonatm.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.&lt;ref name=tunnel /&gt;

== Software ==
[[File:Windows XP sighted 'in the wild' on a cash point, 3 August 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Although Microsoft discontinued support for the operating system in 2014, a significant number of ATMs as of 2020 still use versions of [[Microsoft Windows XP|Windows XP]], as seen with this machine at a branch of [[Tesco Express]] in [[Slough]], Berkshire.]]
With the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]].

[[File:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]] (system screen removed due to copyright infringement).]]

Today, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}{{update inline|date=September 2015|reason=Are the machines still using such an old operating system?  I would expect they would need to be using a more up-to-date software}} In early 2014, 95% of ATMs were running Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326772/windows-xp-powers-95-percent-of-atms-worldwide|title=The death of Windows XP will impact 95 percent of the world's ATMs|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-01-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204090736/https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326772/windows-xp-powers-95-percent-of-atms-worldwide|archivedate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of deployments may still be running older versions of the Windows OS, such as [[Windows NT]], [[Windows CE]], or [[Windows 2000]], even though Microsoft still supports only [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]].

There is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) [[real-time operating system]]s (RTOS). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine|title=Risks search results for &quot;cash machine&quot;|access-date=2 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727111748/http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine|archive-date=27 July 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based [[Vortex Engineering]] is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux.
Common application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |title=Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language |publisher=selfserviceworld.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329032543/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |archivedate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.

While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's &quot;[[write once, run anywhere]]&quot; mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences among various platforms.

With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems.

Notable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR APTRA Edge]], [[Absolute Systems]] AbsoluteINTERACT, [[KAL (Korala Associates Limited)|KAL Kalignite Software Platform]], Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, [[Wincor Nixdorf|Wincor Nixdorf ProTopas]], [[Euronet Worldwide|Euronet]] EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.

With the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |title=Technology News: Security: Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern |publisher=Technewsworld.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318100752/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |archivedate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on labor ==
The number of human [[bank teller]]s in the United States increased from approximately 300,000 in 1970 to approximately 600,000 in 2010. Counter-intuitively, a contributing factor may be the introduction of automated teller machines. ATMs let a branch operate with fewer tellers, making it cheaper for banks to open more branches. This likely resulted in more tellers being hired to handle non-automated tasks, but further automation and [[online banking]] may reverse this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.recode.net/2017/5/8/15584268/eric-schmidt-alphabet-automation-atm-bank-teller |title=Eric Schmidt said ATMs led to more jobs for bank tellers. It's not that simple. |date=8 May 2017 |author=Tess Townsend  |work=Recode}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{main|Security of automated teller machines}}
[[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.

=== Physical ===
[[File:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]].]]

Early ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by [[ram-raiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|title=Things to Keep in Mind when Opting for Free ATM Placements|accessdate=2015-09-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090102/http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|archivedate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.

Another attack method, ''plofkraak'', is to seal all openings of the ATM with [[silicone]] and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |title=ATM bombings up 3000% |accessdate=2011-04-07 |date=2008-07-12 |work=News24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114174333/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |archivedate=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theft has occurred in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|title=Dutch blaggers explode ATMs|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810130621/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|archivedate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |title=Attacks on banks devised in Europe - National |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629151743/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Businessweek |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-atm-bombers/ |first=Nick |last=Summers |date=27 January 2015 |title=Boom: Inside a British Bank Bombing Spree |accessdate=10 June 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.

Several attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.&lt;ref name=tunnel&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |title=Thieves dig 100ft tunnel to steal cash in Levenshulme |accessdate=2012-01-02 |date=2012-01-14 |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114052858/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |archivedate=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of [[Intelligent banknote neutralisation system|Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems]].

A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.

=== Transactional secrecy and integrity ===

The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be &quot;[[trusted system]]s&quot;.

Encryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012175105/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. [[Message Authentication Code]] (MAC) or [[Partial MAC]] may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.

=== Customer identity integrity ===
[[File:Japanese ATM Palm Scanner.jpg|thumb|A [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ|BTMU]] ATM with a [[palm scanner]] (to the right of the screen)]]

There have also been a number of incidents of fraud by [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718062007/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-18 |title=The No. 1 ATM security concern |publisher=ATM Marketplace |accessdate=2011-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |title=Diebold ATM Fraud |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930071206/http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140906/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris recognition|iris]], and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175306/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Device operation integrity ===
[[File:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|upright|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal- and weather- resistant.]]

Openings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.

To protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.

Rules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&amp;lmf=11440&amp;mode=readdoc&amp;tmf=11440|title=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |title=Banking |publisher=Moneycentral.msn.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417111312/http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer security ===
[[File:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|left|Dunbar armored personnel watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]]]]

In some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |title=NYSBD - Text of the ATM Safety Act |publisher=Banking.state.ny.us |date=1997-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410044556/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |archivedate=10 April 2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], The [[New York State]] Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |title=DiNapoli Calls for Better Oversight of Bank ATMs |publisher=Osc.state.ny.us |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610044250/http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230352/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230332/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as far back as 30 July 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, 30 July 1986, Page 18232 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |title=ATM Report |publisher=Obre.state.il.us |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104220104/http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm Credit Union tech-talk news and technology resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073753/https://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm |date=16 October 2015 }}.

In 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an [[emergency telephone number]] switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.

In China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.

As of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html Could Reverse PIN Save Lives at ATM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013150036/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html |date=13 October 2014 }}.

===Jackpotting===
The term {{em|jackpotting}} is used to describe one method criminals utilize to steal money from an ATM.  The thieves gain physical access through a small hole drilled in the machine. They disconnect the existing hard drive and connect an external drive using an industrial endoscope. They then depress an internal button that reboots the device so that it is now under the control of the external drive. They can then have the ATM dispense all of its cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ATM makers warn of 'jackpotting' hacks on U.S. machines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-atms-usa/atm-makers-warn-of-jackpotting-hacks-on-u-s-machines-idUSKBN1FG0WU |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=27 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encryption===
In recent years, many ATMs also encrypt the hard disk. This means that actually creating the software for [[jackpotting]] is more difficult, and provides more security for the ATM.

ATMs were originally developed as cash dispensers, and have evolved to provide many other bank-related functions: 
* Paying routine bills, fees, and taxes (utilities, phone bills, social security, legal fees, income taxes, etc.)
* Printing or ordering [[bank statement]]s
* Updating [[passbook]]s
* [[Cash advance]]s
* Cheque Processing Module
* Paying (in full or partially) the credit balance on a card linked to a specific [[Current account (banking)|current account]].
* Transferring money between linked accounts (such as transferring between accounts)
* Deposit currency recognition, acceptance, and recycling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=15827&amp;site=5&amp;prc= |title=Rising interest rates, gas prices hit vault-cash providers |publisher=selfserviceworld.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329032548/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=15827&amp;site=5&amp;prc= |archivedate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2004/20040318.html |title=NCR and Fujitsu Develop Cash Deposit and Bill Recycling Module for ATMs : Fujitsu Global |publisher=Fujitsu.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403043533/http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2004/20040318.html |archivedate=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank network (e.g.: [[Multibanco]] in Portugal), ATMs include many functions that are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:
* Loading monetary value into [[stored-value card]]s
* Adding pre-paid [[cell phone]] / [[mobile phone]] credit.
* Purchasing

Fine examples of first century objects made from chalcedony, possibly [[Kushan]], were found in recent years at [[Tillya-tepe]] in north-western [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 12 of the translation of ''Weilue'' - a 3rd-century Chinese text by John Hill under &quot;carnelian&quot; and note 12.12 (17)A.

&lt;/ref&gt; Hot wax would not stick to it so it was often used to make [[Seal (device)|seal]] impressions.
The term ''chalcedony'' is derived from the name of the ancient Greek town Chalkedon in [[Asia Minor]], in modern English usually spelled [[Chalcedon]], today the [[Kadıköy]] district of [[Istanbul]].

According to tradition, at least three varieties of chalcedony were used in the Jewish High Priest's Breastplate. (Jewish tradition states that Moses' brother Aaron wore the Breastplate, with inscribed gems representing the twelve tribes of Israel). The Breastplate supposedly included ''jasper'', ''chrysoprase'' and ''sardonyx'', and there is some debate as to whether other ''agates'' were also used.

In the 19th century, [[Idar-Oberstein]], Germany, became the world's largest chalcedony processing center, working mostly on agates. Most of these agates were from Latin America, in particular Brazil. Originally the agate carving industry around Idar and Oberstein was driven by local deposits that were mined in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;streeter1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Precious Stones and Gems |last=Streeter |first=Edwin |date=1898 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors contributed to the re-emergence of Idar-Oberstein as agate center of the world: ships brought agate nodules back as ballast, thus providing extremely cheap transport.  In addition, cheap labor and a superior knowledge of chemistry allowed them to dye the agates in any color with processes that were kept secret. Each mill in Idar-Oberstein had four or five grindstones. These were of red sandstone, obtained from Zweibrücken; and two men ordinarily worked together at the same stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;streeter1&quot; /&gt;

===Structure===

Chalcedony was once thought to be a fibrous variety of cryptocrystalline [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-960.html |title=Chalcedony mineral information and data |website=www.mindat.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821000434/http://www.mindat.org/min-960.html |archivedate=2006-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently however, it has been shown to also contain a [[monoclinic]] polymorph of quartz, known as [[moganite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heany_1994&quot; /&gt;  The fraction, by mass, of moganite within a typical chalcedony sample may vary from less than 5% to over 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;heany_1992&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Heaney |first1=Peter J. |last2=Post |first2=Jeffrey E. |date=24 January 1992 |title=The Widespread Distribution of a Novel Silica Polymorph in Microcrystalline Quartz Varieties |journal=Science |series=New Series |volume=255 |issue=5043 |pages=441–443 |doi=10.1126/science.255.5043.441 |pmid=17842895 |jstor=2876012|s2cid=32497622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of moganite was once regarded as dubious, but it is now officially recognised by the [[International Mineralogical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Origlieri |first=Marcus |date=January 1994 |title=Moganite: a New Mineral -- Not! |url=http://fgms.home.att.net/moganite.htm |journal=Lithosphere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309094336/http://fgms.home.att.net/moganite.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Nickel |first1=Ernest H. |last2=Nichols |first2=Monte C. |date=16 May 2008 |title=IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names |url=http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/ima-cnmmn/MINERALlist.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Materials Data |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530134400/http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/ima-cnmmn/MINERALlist.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-30 |access-date=2008-06-29}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solubility===

Chalcedony is more [[soluble]] than quartz under low-temperature conditions, despite the two minerals being chemically identical. This is thought to be because chalcedony is extremely finely grained (cryptocrystalline), and so has a very high surface area to volume ratio. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  It has also been suggested that the higher solubility is due to the moganite component.&lt;ref name=&quot;heany_1992&quot; /&gt;

'''Carnelian''' (also spelled '''cornelian'''&lt;ref&gt;Websters New World College Dictionary. Fourth Edition. 2001. Editor in chief Michael Agnes.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a brownish-red [[mineral]] commonly used as a semi-precious [[gemstone]]. Similar to carnelian is '''sard''', which is generally harder and darker (the difference is not rigidly defined, and the two names are often used interchangeably). Both carnelian and sard are varieties of the [[silica]] mineral [[chalcedony]] colored by impurities of [[Iron(III) oxide|iron oxide]]. The color can vary greatly, ranging from pale orange to an intense almost-black coloration. It is most commonly found in Indonesia, Brazil, India, Russia (Siberia), and Germany.

The red variety of chalcedony has been known to be used as beads since the Early Neolithic in Bulgaria. The first faceted (with constant 16+16=32 facets on each side of the bead) carnelian beads are described from the Varna [[Chalcolithic]] necropolis (middle of the 5th millennium BC).{{sfnp|Kostov|Pelevina|2008}} The [[bow drill]] was used to drill holes into carnelian in [[Mehrgarh]] in the 4th-5th millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Kulke&amp;R.&gt;Kulke, Hermann &amp; Rothermund, Dietmar (2004). ''A History of India''. Routledge. 22. {{ISBN|0-415-32920-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnelian was recovered from [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] layers at [[Knossos]] on [[Crete]] in a form that demonstrated its use in decorative arts;&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; this use dates to approximately 1800 [[Before the Common Era|BC]]. Carnelian was used widely during Roman times to make [[engraved gems]] for signet or [[seal ring]]s for imprinting a seal with wax on correspondence or other important documents. Hot wax does not stick to carnelian.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12 of the translation of ''Weilue'' - a 3rd-century Chinese text by John Hill under &quot;carnelian&quot; and note 12.12 (17)&lt;/ref&gt; Sard was used for [[Assyria]]n [[cylinder seal]]s, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Phoenicia]]n [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]], and early [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and Etruscan gems.&lt;ref name=&quot;1911EB_sard&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''odem'' (also translated ''sardius''), the first stone in the [[Hoshen|High Priest's breastplate]], was a red stone, probably sard but perhaps red [[jasper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1911EB_sard&quot; /&gt; In [[Revelation 4|Revelation 4:3]], the One seated on the heavenly throne seen in the vision of [[John the apostle]] is said to &quot;look like jasper and 'σαρδίῳ' (sardius transliterated).&quot; And likewise it is in Revelation 21:20 as one of the precious stones in the foundations of the wall of the heavenly city.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|4:3|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Neo-Assyrian]] seal made of carnelian in the Western Asiatic Seals collection of the [[British Museum]] that shows [[Ishtar]]-[[Nintinugga|Gula]] as a star goddess. She is holding a ring of royal authority and is seated on a throne. She is shown with the spade of [[Marduk]] (his symbol), Sibbiti (שבע or ''sheva'' in [[Hebrew language]]) gods, stylus of [[Nabu]] and a worshiper. An 8th century BCE carnelian seal from the collection of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] shows Ishtar-Gula with her dog facing the spade of Marduk and his red dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dalley |first1=Stephanie |title=Esther's Revenge at Susa: From Sennacherib to Ahasuerus |date=29 November 2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199216635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5gSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14 |accessdate=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Although now the more common term, &quot;carnelian&quot; is a 16th-century corruption of the 14th-century word &quot;cornelian&quot; (and its associated orthographies corneline and cornalyn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornelian|url=http://www.oed.com|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelian, cognate with similar words in several [[Romance languages]], comes from the [[Mediaeval Latin]] ''corneolus'', itself derived from the [[Latin]] word ''cornum'', the [[European Cornel|cornel cherry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Carnelian}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose translucent red fruits resemble the stone. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] calls &quot;carnelian&quot; a perversion of &quot;cornelian,&quot; by subsequent analogy with the Latin word ''caro, carnis'', flesh. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], sard derived its name from the city of [[Sardis]] in [[Lydia]] from which it came, and according to others, may ultimately be related to the [[Persian language|Persian]] word سرد ''sered'', meaning yellowish red.&lt;ref name=&quot;1911EB_sard&quot; /&gt;  ''Sarx'' in Greek means &quot;flesh&quot;, and other stones have similar naming, such as the onyx stone in sardonyx, which came from Greek for &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;fingernail&quot; because onyx with flesh-colored and white bands can resemble a fingernail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/onyx. etymonline.com. Retrieved 26 September 2019.]&lt;/ref&gt; So this type of use analogy may have been more widespread.

The names carnelian and sard are often used interchangeably, but they can also be used to describe distinct subvarieties. The general differences are as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;1911EB_sard&quot; /&gt;

All of these properties vary across a continuum, so the boundary between carnelian and sard is inherently blurry.

'''Calcite''' is a [[Carbonate minerals|carbonate mineral]] and the most stable [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], based on [[Scratch hardness|scratch]] [[hardness comparison]], defines value 3 as &quot;calcite&quot;.

Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals [[aragonite]] and [[vaterite]]. Aragonite will change to calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yoshioka S. |author2=Kitano Y. |title=Transformation of aragonite to calcite through heating |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/geochemj1966/19/4/19_4_245/_pdf |journal=Geochemical Journal |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=24–249 |year= 1985|doi=10.2343/geochemj.19.245 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Staudigel P.

==Etymology==
Calcite is derived from the German ''Calcit'', a term coined in the 19th century from the Latin word for [[Lime (material)|lime]], ''calx'' (genitive calcis) with the suffix -ite used to name minerals. It is thus etymologically related to [[chalk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=calcite (n.) |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/calcite|accessdate=6 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When applied by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and stone trade professionals, the term [[alabaster]] is used not just as in geology and mineralogy, where it is reserved for a variety of [[gypsum]]; but also for a similar-looking, [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] variety of fine-grained banded deposit of calcite.&lt;ref&gt;''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of the same terms by geologists, archaeologists and the stone trade. Oxford University Museum of Natural History, 2012 [http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/corsi/files/pdf/Alabaster-travertine.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unit cell and Miller indices==
In publications, two different sets of [[Miller indices]] are used to describe directions in calcite crystals - the hexagonal system with three indices {{math|''h, k, l''}} and the rhombohedral system with four indices {{math|''h, k, l, i''}}. To add to the complications, there are also two definitions of unit cell for calcite. One, an older &quot;morphological&quot; unit cell, was inferred by measuring angles between faces of crystals and looking for the smallest numbers that fit. Later, a &quot;structural&quot; unit cell was determined using [[X-ray crystallography]]. The morphological unit cell has approximate dimensions {{math|''a'' {{=}} 10 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}} and {{math|''c'' {{=}} 8.5 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}}, while for the structural unit cell they are {{math|''a'' {{=}} 5 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}} and {{math|''c'' {{=}} 17 [[Ångstrom|Å]]}}. For the same orientation, {{math|''c''}} must be multiplied by 4 to convert from morphological to structural units. As an example, the cleavage is given as &quot;perfect on {1 0 {{overline|1}} 1}&quot; in morphological coordinates and &quot;perfect on {1 0 {{overline|1}} 4}&quot; in structural units. (In hexagonal indices, these are {1 0 1} and {1 0 4}.) Twinning, cleavage and crystal forms are always given in morphological units.&lt;ref name=mindat&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcite|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-859.html|website=mindat.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|chapter=Chiral crystal faces of common rock-forming minerals|editor-last1=Palyi|editor-first1=C.|editor-last2=Zucchi|editor-first2=C.|editor-last3=Caglioti|editor-first3=L.|title=Progress in Biological Chirality|url=https://archive.org/details/progressbiologic00plyi|url-access=limited|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/progressbiologic00plyi/page/n413 137]&amp;ndash;151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties ==
===Form===
Over 800 forms of calcite [[crystal]]s have been identified. Most common are [[scalenohedron|scalenohedra]], with faces in the hexagonal {2 1 1} directions (morphological unit cell) or {2 1 4} directions (structural unit cell); and rhombohedral, with faces in the {1 0 1} or {1 0 4} directions (the most common cleavage plane).&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt; Habits include acute to obtuse rhombohedra, tabular forms, [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]], or various [[scalenohedron|scalenohedra]]. Calcite exhibits several [[crystal twinning|twinning]] types adding to the variety of observed forms. It may occur as fibrous, granular, lamellar, or compact. A fibrous, efflorescent form is known as [[lublinite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lublinite|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-9512.html|website=mindat.org|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleavage is usually in three directions parallel to the rhombohedron form. Its fracture is [[Conchoidal fracture|conchoidal]], but difficult to obtain.

Scalenohedral faces are [[chiral]] and come in pairs with mirror-image symmetry; their growth can be influenced by interaction with chiral biomolecules such as L- and D-[[amino acid]]s. Rhombohedral faces are achiral.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;

===Hardness===
It has a defining [[Mohs hardness]] of 3, a [[specific gravity]] of 2.71, and its luster is vitreous in crystallized varieties. Color is white or none, though shades of gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, or even black can occur when the mineral is charged with impurities.

Calcite is transparent to opaque and may occasionally show [[phosphorescence]] or [[fluorescence]]. A transparent variety called ''[[Iceland spar]]'' is used for optical purposes. Acute scalenohedral crystals are sometimes referred to as &quot;dogtooth spar&quot; while the rhombohedral form is sometimes referred to as &quot;nailhead spar&quot;.

[[File:Fluorescence in calcite.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Demonstration of birefringence in calcite, using 445 nm laser]]
Single calcite crystals display an optical property called [[birefringence]] (double refraction). This strong birefringence causes objects viewed through a clear piece of calcite to appear doubled. The birefringent effect (using calcite) was first described by the [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist [[Rasmus Bartholin]] in 1669. At a wavelength of ≈590&amp;nbsp;nm calcite has ordinary and extraordinary [[refractive index|refractive indices]] of 1.658 and 1.486, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.info/refraction/|title=Refraction|last=Elert|first=Glenn|work=The Physics Hypertextbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 190 and 1700&amp;nbsp;nm, the ordinary refractive index varies roughly between 1.9 and 1.5, while the extraordinary refractive index varies between 1.6 and 1.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-6090(97)00843-2| title = Determination of optical anisotropy in calcite from ultraviolet to mid-infrared by generalized ellipsometry| journal = Thin Solid Films| volume = 313–314| issue = 1–2| pages = 341–346| year = 1998| last1 = Thompson | first1 = D.

===Chemical===
Calcite, like most carbonates, will dissolve with most forms of acid. Calcite can be either [[solvation|dissolved]] by groundwater or [[precipitate]]d by groundwater, depending on several factors including the water temperature, [[acidity|pH]], and dissolved [[ion]] concentrations. Although calcite is fairly insoluble in cold water, acidity can cause dissolution of calcite and release of carbon dioxide gas. Ambient carbon dioxide, due to its acidity, has a slight solubilizing effect on calcite. Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases.  When conditions are right for precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together or it can fill fractures.  When conditions are right for dissolution, the removal of calcite can dramatically increase the [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of the rock, and if it continues for a long period of time may result in the formation of [[cave]]s. On a landscape scale, continued dissolution of calcium carbonate-rich rocks can lead to the expansion and eventual collapse of cave systems, resulting in various forms of [[Karst|karst topography]].

==Use and applications==
[[File:Tutankhamun's Alabaster Jar.jpg|thumb|left|One of several calcite or alabaster perfume jars from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], d. 1323 BC ]]
Ancient Egyptians carved many items out of calcite, relating it to their goddess [[Bastet|Bast]], whose name contributed to the term [[alabaster]] because of the close association. Many other cultures have used the material for similar carved objects and applications.

A transparent variety of calcite known as [[Iceland spar]] may have been used by [[Vikings]] for navigating on cloudy days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perkins |first1=Sid |title=Viking seafarers may have navigated with legendary crystals |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/viking-seafarers-may-have-navigated-legendary-crystals |website=sciencemag.org |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate=13 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
High-grade optical calcite was used in World War II for gun sights, specifically in bomb sights and anti-aircraft weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/dec/05/borregos-calcite-mine-trail-holds-desert-wonders/|title =Borrego's calcite mine trail holds desert wonders| accessdate = 2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, experiments have been conducted to use calcite for a [[cloak of invisibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Xianzhong|last2=Luo|first2=Yu|last3=Zhang|first3=Jingjing|last4=Jiang|first4=Kyle|last5=Pendry|first5=John B.|last6=Zhang|first6=Shuang|doi=10.1038/ncomms1176|title=Macroscopic invisibility cloaking of visible light|pmid=21285954|year=2011|page=176|volume=2|journal=Nature Communications|issue=2|pmc=3105339|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2E.176C |arxiv =1012.2783 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Calcite is a common constituent of [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[limestone]] in particular, much of which is formed from the shells of dead marine organisms.  Approximately 10% of sedimentary rock is limestone. It is the primary mineral in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[marble]]. It also occurs in deposits from [[hot spring]]s as a [[Vein (geology)|vein]] mineral; in [[cavern]]s as [[stalactite]]s and [[stalactite|stalagmite]]s; and in [[volcano|volcanic]] or [[mantle (geology)|mantle-derived]] rocks such as [[carbonatite]]s, [[kimberlite]]s, or rarely in [[peridotite]]s.

Calcite is often the primary constituent of the [[Seashell|shell]]s of [[Marine biology|marine organism]]s, e.g., [[plankton]] (such as [[coccolith]]s and planktic [[foraminifera]]), the hard parts of red [[algae]], some [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, some [[Serpulidae|serpulids]], most [[bryozoa]], and parts of the shells of some [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] (such as [[oyster]]s and [[rudists]]). Calcite is found in spectacular form in the [[Snowy River Cave]] of [[New Mexico]] as mentioned above, where microorganisms are credited with natural formations. [[Trilobite]]s, which became [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|extinct a quarter billion years ago]], had unique compound eyes that used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Angier, Natalie |author-link=Natalie Angier |date=3 March 2014 |title=When Trilobites Ruled the World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/when-trilobites-ruled-the-world.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest documented single crystal of calcite originated from Iceland, measured 7×7×2 m and 6×6×3 m and weighed about 250 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = Rickwood, P.

== Formation processes ==

The crystallization of ACC can occur in two stages: first, the ACC nanoparticles rapidly dehydrate and crystallize to form individual particles of vaterite. Secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C0NR00589D |pmid=21069231 |title=The kinetics and mechanisms of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) crystallization to calcite, via vaterite |journal=Nanoscale |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=265–71 |year=2011 |last1=Rodriguez-Blanco |first1=J. D. |last2=Shaw |first2=S. |last3=Benning |first3=L. G. |bibcode=2011Nanos...3..265R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower. However, the crystallization of calcite has been observed to be dependent on the starting pH and presence of Mg in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.11.057 |title=The role of pH and Mg on the stability and crystallization of amorphous calcium carbonate |journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds |volume=536 |pages=S477–S479 |year=2012 |last1=Rodriguez-Blanco |first1=J. D. |last2=Shaw |first2=S. |last3=Bots |first3=P. |last4=Roncal-Herrero |first4=T. |last5=Benning |first5=L. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neutral starting pH during mixing promotes the direct transformation of ACC into calcite. Conversely, when ACC forms in a solution that starts with a basic initial pH, the transformation to calcite occurs via metastable vaterite, which forms via a spherulitic growth mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cg300676b |title=Mechanistic Insights into the Crystallization of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) |journal=Crystal Growth &amp; Design |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=3806–3814 |year=2012 |last1=Bots |first1=P. |last2=Benning |first2=L. G. |last3=Rodriguez-Blanco |first3=J. D. |last4=Roncal-Herrero |first4=T. |last5=Shaw |first5=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second stage this vaterite transforms to calcite via a surface-controlled dissolution and recrystallization mechanism. Mg has a noteworthy effect on both the stability of ACC and its transformation to crystalline CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of calcite directly from ACC, as this ion destabilizes the structure of vaterite.

Calcite may form in the subsurface in response to activity of microorganisms, such as during sulfate-dependent [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]], where methane is oxidized and sulfate is reduced by a consortium of methane oxidizers and sulfate reducers, leading to precipitation of calcite and [[pyrite]] from the produced bicarbonate and sulfide. These processes can be traced by the specific [[carbon isotope]] composition of the calcites, which are extremely depleted in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, by as much as −125 per mil [[Δ13C#Reference standard|PDB]] (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |pages=7020 |year=2015 |title=Extreme &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C depletion of carbonates formed during oxidation of biogenic methane in fractured granite |author=Drake, H. |author2=Astrom, M.

==In Earth history==
[[Calcite sea]]s existed in Earth history when the primary inorganic precipitate of calcium carbonate in marine waters was low-magnesium calcite (lmc), as opposed to the [[aragonite]] and high-magnesium calcite (hmc) precipitated today.  Calcite seas alternated with [[aragonite sea]]s over the Phanerozoic, being most prominent in the [[Ordovician]] and [[Jurassic]].  Lineages evolved to use whichever morph of calcium carbonate was favourable in the ocean at the time they became mineralised, and retained this mineralogy for the remainder of their evolutionary history.&lt;ref name='Porter2007'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1137284|title=Seawater Chemistry and Early Carbonate Biomineralization|year=2007|last1=Porter|first1=S.

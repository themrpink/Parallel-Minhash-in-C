Three men pursued Dillinger into the alley and fired. Clarence Hurt shot twice, [[Charles B. Winstead|Charles Winstead]] three times, and [[Herman Hollis]] once. Dillinger was hit from behind and fell face first to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0722.html|title=Dillinger Slain in Chicago; Shot Dead by Federal Men in Front of Movie Theater.|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=2013-02-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillinger was struck four times, with two bullets grazing him and one causing a superficial wound to the right side. The fatal bullet entered through the back of his neck, severed the spinal cord, passed into his brain and exited just under the right eye, severing two sets of veins and arteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.J.

Two female bystanders, Theresa Paulas and Etta Natalsky, were wounded.

There were reports of people dipping their handkerchiefs and skirts into the pool of blood that had formed, as Dillinger lay in the alley, as [[Souvenir|keepsakes]]. &quot;Souvenir hunters madly dipped newspapers in the blood that stained the pavement.

As many as four [[death mask]]s were also made.&lt;ref&gt;Girardin, Helmer, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillinger is buried at [[Crown Hill Cemetery]] in Indianapolis. Dillinger's gravestone has been replaced several times because of vandalism by people chipping off pieces as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=10615815|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120918050744/http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=10615815|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-18|title=Dillinger's grave attracting crowds due to Public Enemies movie.|publisher=Wkowtv.com|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilton Crouch (1903–1976), an associate of Dillinger's on some early heists, is buried only a few yards to the west.&lt;ref&gt;Girardin/Helmer, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2019, Indiana state officials approved plans to exhume the remains buried in Dillinger's grave, at the request of Dillinger's relatives who believe that the man shot at the Biograph theater was not actually Dillinger. The FBI has dismissed this claim as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. The exhumation was scheduled for December 31, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49946501|title=John Dillinger: US gangster's body set to be exhumed|date=October 5, 2019|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to information from January 2020, Dillinger’s body will not be exhumed. His nephew and his niece quit those plans and History Channel also cancelled the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Dillinger's Body Won't Be Exhumed, After All|periodical=Rolling Stone Magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/john-dillinger-family-wont-exhume-body-935691/|url-status=|format=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=January 9, 2020|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gentleman's Agreement''''' is a 1947 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on [[Laura Z. Hobson]]'s best-selling 1947 [[Gentleman's Agreement (novel)|novel of the same name]]. It concerns a journalist (played by [[Gregory Peck]]) who poses as a Jew to research an exposé on the widespread [[Anti-Semitism|distrust and dislike of Jews]] in New York City and the affluent communities of [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] and [[Darien, Connecticut]]. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and won three: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Celeste Holm]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] ([[Elia Kazan]]).

The movie was controversial in its day, as was a similar film on the same subject, ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'', which was released the same year (though that film was originally a story about [[homophobia]], later changed to anti-Semitism).

In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on DVD as part of the 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.

==Plot==
[[File:Dorothy McGuire and Gregory Peck in Gentleman's Agreement trailer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dorothy McGuire]] and [[Gregory Peck]]]]
Philip Schuyler Green ([[Gregory Peck]]) is a widowed journalist who has just moved to New York City with his son Tommy ([[Dean Stockwell]]) and mother ([[Anne Revere]]). Green meets with magazine publisher John Minify ([[Albert Dekker]]), who asks Green, a [[Gentile]], to write an article on [[anti-Semitism]] (&quot;Some people don't like other people just because they're Jews&quot;). He is not very enthusiastic at first, but after initially struggling with how to approach the topic in a fresh way, Green is inspired to adopt a Jewish identity (&quot;Phil Greenberg&quot;) and writes about his first-hand experiences.

At a lunch party, Phil meets Minify's divorced niece Kathy Lacey ([[Dorothy McGuire]]), a pre-school teacher, who turns out to be the person who originally suggested the story idea. The next day, Phil tries to explain anti-Jewish prejudice to his young, precocious son&amp;nbsp;– directly after displaying some anti-female prejudice of his own. Green tells his mother that he's struck by the odd notion that the idea for the article came from &quot;a girl&quot; at the magazine. His mother replies, &quot;Why, women will be thinking next&quot;. Phil and Kathy begin dating. They agree to keep it secret that Phil is not Jewish.

Phil has difficulty getting started on his assignment. He realizes he can never feel what another person feels unless he experiences it himself. He recalls having &quot;lived as an [[Okie]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]&quot; or as a coal miner for previous writing jobs, instead of tapping a man on the shoulder and making him talk. He then decides to write, &quot;I Was Jewish for Six Months&quot;.

Though Kathy seems to have [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views, when he reveals what he intends to do, she is taken aback and asks if he actually is Jewish. The strain on their relationship due to Kathy's subtle acquiescence to [[bigotry]] becomes a key theme in the film.

At the magazine, Phil is assigned a secretary, Elaine Wales ([[June Havoc]]), who reveals that she, too, is Jewish. She changed her name to get the job (her application under her real, Jewish-sounding name, Estelle Wilovsky, was rejected). After Phil informs Minify about Wales' experience, Minify orders the magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Wales has reservations about the new policy, fearing that the &quot;wrong Jews&quot; will be hired and ruin things for the few Jews working there now. Phil meets fashion editor Anne Dettrey ([[Celeste Holm]]), who becomes a good friend and potentially more, particularly as strains develop between Phil and Kathy.

Phil's childhood friend, Dave Goldman ([[John Garfield]]), who is Jewish, moves to New York for a job and lives with the Greens while he looks for a home for his family. Dave also experiences anti-Semitism, when some person in the armed forces tells him that he hates Jews, and gets into a brief fight before the prejudiced soldier is taken away. Housing is scarce in the city, but it is particularly difficult for Goldman, since not all landlords will rent to a Jewish family. When Phil tells Dave about his project, Dave is supportive, but concerned.

As Phil researches his story, he experiences several incidents of bigotry. When his mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with an obviously Jewish name, suggesting he might be cheated. When Phil reveals that he is himself Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves. In addition, the janitor is shocked to see that a Jewish name is listed on the mail box, instead of his Christian name. Also, when Phil wants to celebrate his honeymoon at a swanky hotel for rich people in the country, the hotel manager refuses to register Phil, because Phil is Jewish, and tells him to register at a different hotel instead. Tommy becomes the target of [[bullying|bullies]] when his schoolmates discover he is Jewish. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles Tommy, telling him their taunts of &quot;dirty Jew&quot; are wrong because he isn't Jewish, not that the [[epithet]] is wrong in and of itself.

Kathy's attitudes are revealed further when she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane ([[Jane Wyatt]]) invites them to a celebration in her home in [[Darien, Connecticut]], which is known to be a &quot;restricted&quot; community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene, Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil is only pretending to be a Jew, but Phil prevails on Kathy to tell only Jane. At the party, everyone is very friendly to Phil, though many people are &quot;unable&quot; to attend at the last minute.

Dave announces that he will have to quit his job because he cannot find a residence for his family. Kathy owns a vacant cottage in Darien, but though Phil sees it as the obvious solution to Dave's problem, Kathy is unwilling to offend her neighbors by renting it to a Jewish family. She and Phil break their engagement. Phil announces that he will be moving away from New York when his article is published. When it comes out, it is very well received by the magazine staff.

Kathy meets with Dave and tells him how sick she felt when a party guest told a bigoted joke. However, she has no answer when Dave repeatedly asks her what she did about it. She comes to realize that remaining silent condones the prejudice.

The next day, Dave tells Phil that he and his family will be moving into the cottage in Darien, and Kathy will be moving in with her sister next door to make sure they are treated well by their neighbors. When Phil hears this, he reconciles with Kathy.

==Production==
Zanuck decided to make a film version of Hobson's novel after being refused membership in the [[Los Angeles Country Club]], because it was assumed (incorrectly) that he was Jewish. Before filming commenced, [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and other Jewish film executives approached Darryl Zanuck and asked him not to make the film, fearing it would &quot;stir up trouble&quot;. They also warned that [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] enforcer, [[Joseph Breen]], might not allow the film to pass the censors, as he had been known to make disparaging remarks about Jews. There was also concern that Dorothy McGuire's character's being divorced would offend the [[National Legion of Decency]].

The role of Phillip Green was first offered to [[Cary Grant]], but he turned it down. Peck decided to accept the role, although his agent advised him to refuse, believing Peck would be endangering his career. Jewish actor John Garfield agreed to play a lesser role in the film to be a part of it.

Portions of the film were shot on location in Darien, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Haney |title=Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life|publisher= Da Capo Press|date= 2003 |ISBN =0-7867-1473-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and box-office==
''Gentleman's Agreement'' received a generally favorable reception from influential ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]]. Crowther said that &quot;every point about prejudice which Miss Hobson had to make in her book has been made with superior illustration and more graphic demonstration in the film, so that the sweep of her moral indignation is not only widened, but intensified thereby&quot;. However, Crowther also said that the movie shared the novel's failings in that &quot;explorations are narrowly confined to the upper-class social and professional level to which he is immediately exposed&quot;. He also said the main character's shock at the extent of anti-Semitism was lacking in credibility: &quot;It is, in a careful analysis, an extraordinarily naive role.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE7DE113AE233A25751C1A9679D946693D6CF |title=''Gentleman's Agreement'' (1947) |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 11, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to winning Academy Awards for best picture and best director, ''Gentleman's Agreement'' was one of Fox's highest-grossing movies of 1947. The political nature of the film, however, upset the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], with [[Elia Kazan]], [[Darryl F. Zanuck|Darryl Zanuck]], [[John Garfield]], and [[Anne Revere]] all being called to testify before the committee. Revere refused to testify and although Garfield appeared, he refused to &quot;name names&quot;. Both were placed in the ''[[Red Channels]]'' of the [[Hollywood Blacklist]]. Garfield remained on the blacklist for a year, was called again to testify against his wife, and died of a heart attack at the age of 39 before his second hearing date.

In recognition for producing ''Gentleman's Agreement'', the Hollywood chapter of [[B'nai B'rith International]] honored Darryl Zanuck as its &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for 1948. On Sunday, December 12, a gala commemoration evening was held in downtown Los Angeles, at the Biltmore Hotel, before a crowd of over a thousand. Among the tributes to Zanuck, New Mexico Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson|Clinton Anderson]] said, &quot;He does not storm up and down the streets of a community, urging its citizens to do good. He does not fill the pages of books with words that string together into a sermon. He allows you to be seated comfortably in a theater, to be absorbed in a problem and to walk out into the night with your thoughts clarified and your lips saying, 'This situation ought to be changed'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times''. (December 14, 1948). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the formal speeches there was a star-studded variety show, including the debut before the Hollywood film world of the team of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].

The movie was an unexpected hit at the box office. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it earned $3.9&amp;nbsp;million in rentals in the US in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-01#page/n45/mode/1up &quot;Top Grossers of 1948&quot;, ''Variety'' 5 January 1949 p 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saint Valentine's Day Massacre''' was the 1929 murder of seven members and associates of Chicago's [[North Side Gang]] that occurred on [[Saint Valentine's Day]]. The men were gathered at a [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] garage on the morning of that [[feast day]]. They were lined up against a wall and shot by four unknown assailants who were dressed like police officers. The incident resulted from the struggle to control organized crime in the city during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] between the Irish North Siders, headed by [[George &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran]], and their Italian [[Chicago outfit|South Side Gang]] rivals led by [[Al Capone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last=O'Brien| first=John| title=The St. Valentine's Day Massacre| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-valentinesmassacre-story,0,1233196.story|date=February 14, 2014 |accessdate=June 28, 2017| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators have never been conclusively identified, but former members of the [[Egan's Rats]] gang working for Capone are suspected of a significant role, as are members of the [[Chicago Police Department]] who allegedly wanted revenge for the killing of a police officer's son.

At 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Saint Valentine's Day, Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 [[North Clark Street]],&lt;ref name=cdtsdim&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1929/02/15/page/1/article/slay-doctor-in-massacre |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Slay doctor in massacre |date=February 15, 1929 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tklocty&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1929/02/16/page/1/article/track-killers-lid-on-city |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Trace killers; lid on city |date=February 16, 1929 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]]  neighborhood of Chicago's North Side.

Two of the shooters were dressed as uniformed policemen, while the others wore suits, ties, overcoats, and hats.

'''Blackburn Aircraft Limited''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[aircraft manufacturer]] that concentrated mainly on naval and maritime aircraft during the first part of the 20th century.

==History==
Blackburn Aircraft was founded by [[Robert Blackburn (aviation pioneer)|Robert Blackburn]], who built his first aircraft in [[Leeds]] in 1908 with the company's Olympia Works at [[Roundhay]] opening in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roundhay Ward Neighbourhood Design Statement|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Roundhay%20PDF%20full.pdf|website=leeds.gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2017|page=9|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Derek|title=The History of Modern Leeds|date=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-0781-X|page=164|chapter=VI: Industrial Development, 1780&amp;ndash;1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company was created in 1914&lt;ref name=&quot;:YP:&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Unsung hero who reached for the sky gets another chance to fly high again|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/unsung-hero-who-reached-for-the-sky-gets-another-chance-to-fly-high-again-1-5863522|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established in a new factory at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mistry|first1=Pritti|title=End of an era for Brough workers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-17217413|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert's brother [[Norman Blackburn (aviation pioneer)|Norman Blackburn]] later became managing director.

Blackburn acquired the [[Cirrus aero engines|Cirrus-Hermes Engineering]] company in 1934, beginning its manufacture of aircraft engines. However an updated range of engines was under development and Blackburn wanted to wait until it was established before giving its name to them, so Cirrus Hermes Engineering was retained as a separate company for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 July 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's name was changed to Blackburn Aircraft Limited in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 April 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, with the new Cirrus engines now well established, engine manufacturing was brought into the parent company as an operating division, giving rise to the [[Blackburn Cirrus]] name.{{sfn|Bridgman|1943|p=10d}}

By 1937, pressure to re-arm was growing and the Yorkshire factory was approaching capacity. A fortuitous friendship between [[Maurice Denny]], managing director of Denny Bros., the [[Dumbarton]] ship building company,{{sfn|Bridgman|1943|p=12c}} and Robert Blackburn resulted in the building of a new Blackburn factory at Barge Park, Dumbarton where production of the Blackburn Botha commenced in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherry|first=Alan M.|title=The Blackburn, Dumbarton's Aircraft Factory|year=1996|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781872074825|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn amalgamated with [[General Aircraft Ltd|General Aircraft Limited]] in 1949 as Blackburn and General Aircraft Limited,{{sfn|Halpenny|1982|p=33}} reverting to Blackburn Aircraft Limited by 1958.

As part of the rationalisation of British aircraft manufacturers, its aircraft production and engine operations were absorbed into [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Siddeley]] respectively&lt;ref name=&quot;:YP:&quot; /&gt; in 1960/1961. The Blackburn name was dropped completely in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;:BBC:&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic bi-plane in flying visit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34288508|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American company, Blackburn Aircraft Corp., was incorporated in Detroit on 20 May 1929 to acquire design and patent rights of the aircraft of Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. in the USA. It was owned 90% by [[Detroit Aircraft Corp.]] and 10% by Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. Agreements covered such rights in North and South America, excepting Brazil and certain rights in Canada and provided that all special tools and patterns were to be supplied by the UK company at cost.

===Locations===
The company had factories at Olympia in Leeds, [[Sherburn-in-Elmet]], Brough (East Yorkshire) and Dumbarton. In the early days, Blackburn himself flew aircraft on the beaches at [[Marske-by-the-Sea|Marske]] and [[Filey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memories of flight legend|url=http://www.fileymercury.co.uk/news/transport/memories-of-flight-legend-1-3777364|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=Filey &amp; Hunmanby Mercury|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the company also using the former [[RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor]].{{sfn|Abraham|2002|p=109}} Before production shifted to Sherburn-in-Elmet and Brough from the Leeds site, aircraft were flown in and out of Olympia works by an adjacent airstrip in Roundhay Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roundhay Park (Leeds) - Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust UK|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/airfield-finder/roundhay-park-leeds/|website=www.abct.org.uk|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data''' ('''Lieutenant Commander Data; Mister Data''') is a character in the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. He appears in the [[television program|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') and [[Star Trek: Picard]]; and the feature films ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994), ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996), ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' (1998), and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3050422 |title=A Data with Star Trek again |last=Lee |first=Luaine |date=January 9, 2003 |work=9 January 2003 |access-date=December 9, 2010 |publisher=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is portrayed by actor [[Brent Spiner]].

Data was found by Starfleet in 2338. He was the sole survivor on Omicron Theta in the rubble of a colony left after an attack from the [[Crystalline Entity]]. He was a [[Synthetic biology|synthetic life]] form with [[artificial intelligence]], designed and built by [[Noonien Soong|Doctor Noonien Soong]] in his own likeness (likewise portrayed by Spiner). Data is a [[Self-awareness|self-aware]], [[sapience|sapient]], [[Sentience|sentient]] and anatomically fully functional [[Android (robot)|android]] who serves as the [[Second mate|second officer]] and chief operations officer aboard the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] and later the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]].

His [[positronic brain]] allows him impressive computational capabilities. He experienced ongoing difficulties during the early years of his life with understanding various aspects of [[human behavior]]&lt;ref&gt;''TNG'': &quot;[[Encounter at Farpoint]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and was unable to feel [[emotion]] or understand certain human [[idiosyncrasies]], inspiring him to strive for his own humanity. This goal eventually led to the addition of an &quot;emotion chip&quot;, created by Soong, to Data's positronic net.&lt;ref&gt;''TNG'': &quot;[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent, Part II]]&quot;, &quot;[[Star Trek Generations]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Although Data's endeavor to increase his humanity and desire for human emotional experience is a significant plot point (and source of humor) throughout the series, he consistently shows a nuanced sense of wisdom, sensitivity, and curiosity, garnering respect from his peers and colleagues.

Data is in many ways a successor to the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''{{'}}s [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]), in that the character offers an &quot;outsider's&quot; perspective on humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion |last=Nemeck, Larry |publisher=Pocket Books |year=2003 |isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brent Spiner reprised the role as the consciousness of Data via a VR simulation in the first season of ''Star Trek: Picard'' [https://www.ign.com/articles/picard-finale-michael-chabon-data-death-seven-raffi-star-trek].

==Development==
[[Gene Roddenberry]] told [[Brent Spiner]] that over the course of the series, Data was to become &quot;more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that's the way that the writers took it.&quot; Spiner felt that Data exhibited the [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplinesque]] characteristics of a sad, tragic clown.&lt;ref name=closeup/&gt; To get into his role as Data, Spiner used the character of [[Robby the Robot]] from the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' as a role model.&lt;ref name=&quot;closeup&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/brentspiner.htm |title=Lt. Commander Data visits the Honesty Bar: an Interview with BRENT SPINER |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041003/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/Interviews/brentspiner.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Data's perpetual albino-like appearance, he said: &quot;I spent more hours of the day in make-up than out of make-up&quot;, so much so that he even called it a way of [[method acting]].&lt;ref name=closeup/&gt; Spiner also portrayed Data's manipulative and malevolent brother [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]] (a role he found much easier to play, because the character was &quot;more like me&quot;),&lt;ref name=closeup/&gt; and Data's creator, Dr. [[Noonien Soong]]. Additionally, he portrayed another Soong-type android, [[B-4 (Star Trek)|B-4]], in the film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', and also one of Soong's ancestors in three episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. Spiner said his favorite Data scene takes place in &quot;[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]&quot;, when Data plays poker on the holodeck with a re-creation of the famous physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], played by Hawking himself.&lt;ref name=closeup/&gt;

Spiner reprised his role of Data in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' series finale &quot;[[These Are the Voyages...]]&quot; in an off-screen speaking part. Spiner felt that he had visibly aged out of the role and that Data was best presented as a youthful figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=16437 |title=Brent Spiner Rules Out Star Trek XI |publisher=[[comingsoon.net]] |access-date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiner returned to the role for 2020s ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://trekcore.com/blog/2019/07/star-trek-picard-brings-back-jeri-ryan-brent-spiner-jonathan-frakes-marina-sirtis/ |title=TREK Vets Brent Spiner and Jeri Ryan Back for STAR TREK: PICARD, Plus: Frakes and Sirtis Returning Too! |publisher=TrekCore |access-date=July 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been convinced by the advent of [[De-aging in film|digital de-aging]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/startrek/2020/01/18/star-trek-picard-data-return-brent-spiner-cgi-de-aging/ |title=Star Trek: Digital De-Aging Tech Helped Convince Brent Spiner to Return as Data in Picard |publisher=[[comicbook.com]] |access-date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated the first season of ''Picard'' was his final time playing Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/brent-spiner-is-done-playing-data-after-star-trek-picard|title=Star Trek: Brent Spiner says he's done playing Data after Picard Season 1, but is up to reprise Altan|last=Weiss|first=Josh|date=2020-03-29|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series and films===
[[File:Brent Spiner by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|Actor [[Brent Spiner]] portrayed Data in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''.]]
Dialog in &quot;[[Datalore]]&quot; establishes some of Data's backstory. It is stated that he was deactivated in 2336 on Omicron Theta before an attack by the [[Crystalline Entity]], a spaceborne creature which converts life forms to energy for sustenance. He was found and reactivated by Starfleet personnel two years later. Data went to [[Starfleet Academy]] from 2341–2345 (he describes himself as &quot;Class of '78&quot; to Riker in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;—with &quot;[[Honor society|honors]] in probability mechanics and exobiology&quot;, although canonically may only refer to the stardate) and then served in [[Starfleet]] aboard the USS ''Trieste''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clues (Star Trek: The Next Generation)]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the ''Enterprise'' under Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in 2364. In &quot;Datalore&quot;, Data discovers his amoral brother, [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], and learns that he was created after Lore. Lore fails in an attempt to betray the ''Enterprise'' to the Crystalline Entity, and Wesley Crusher [[transporter (Star Trek)|beams]] Data's brother into space at the episode's conclusion.

In &quot;[[Brothers (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Brothers]]&quot;, Data reunites with Dr. Soong. There he meets again with Lore, who steals the emotion chip Soong meant for Data to receive. Lore then fatally wounds Soong. Lore returns in the two-part episode &quot;[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]&quot;, using the emotion chip to control Data and make him help with Lore's attempt to make the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] entirely artificial lifeforms. Data eventually deactivates Lore, and recovers, but does not install the damaged emotion chip.

In &quot;[[The Measure of a Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Measure of a Man]]&quot;, a Starfleet judge rules that Data is not Starfleet property. The episode establishes that Data has a storage capacity of 800 quadrillion [[bit]]s (1000 [[Terabytes|TB]] or 909 [[Tebibyte|TiB]]) and a total linear computational speed of 60 trillion operations per second (60 [[Terahertz (unit)|THz]]).&lt;ref&gt;''TNG'': &quot;[[The Measure of a Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Measure of a Man]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Data's family is expanded in &quot;[[The Offspring (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Offspring]]&quot;, which introduces Lal, a robot based on Data's neural interface and whom Data refers to as his daughter. Lal &quot;dies&quot; shortly after activation. Later, his mother Julianna appears in the episode &quot;[[Inheritance (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Inheritance]]&quot; and reunites with Data, though the crew discovers she was an android duplicate built by Soong after the real Julianna's death, programmed to die after a long life, and to believe she is the true Julianna, unaware of the fact she is an android. Faced with the decision, Data chooses not to disclose this to her and allows her to continue on with her normal life.

In &quot;[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]&quot;, the two-hour concluding episode of ''The Next Generation'', Captain Picard travels among three different time periods. The Picard of 25 years into the future goes with La Forge to seek advice from Professor Data, a luminary physicist who holds the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Chair]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].

In &quot;[[The Child (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Child]]&quot;, Data clarifies to the newly arrived ship's chief medical officer, Dr. [[Katherine Pulaski]], that the correct pronunciation of his name is ''Day'ta'', not ''Dah'ta''.

In &quot;[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]&quot;, after being briefly attacked by a Klingon officer to test his strength, Data reveals to his attacker that his '...upper spinal support is a poly-alloy, designed to withstand extreme stress, and [his] skull is composed of cortenide and duranium.'

In &quot;[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]&quot;, Data plays holodeck poker with Sir [[Isaac Newton]]; [[Albert Einstein]]; and Professor [[Stephen Hawking]].

In [[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification II]] Data meets Spock and is an interesting contrast: the android who tries so hard to feel emotions and the half-human/Vulcan who tries so hard to hide his emotions.

Although several androids, robots, and artificial intelligences were seen in the original ''Star Trek'' series ([[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]] and [[I, Mudd]]), Data was often referred to as being unique in the galaxy as being the only sentient android known to exist [[The Most Toys (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Most Toys]] (save the other androids created by Soong).&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' novel ''[[Immortal Coil]]'', which explains what happened to all of these in the timeframe between the original series ''Star Trek'' and ''The Next Generation'' and how they relate to Data and Dr. Soong's other androids.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'', Data finally installs the emotion chip he retrieved from Lore, and experiences the full scope of emotions. However, those emotions proved difficult to control and Data struggled to master them. In ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', Data has managed to gain complete control of the chip, which includes deactivating it to maintain his performance efficiency.

In the film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', Data beams Picard off an enemy ship before destroying it, sacrificing himself and saving the captain and crew of the ''Enterprise''. However, Data previously copied his core memories into [[B-4 (Star Trek)|B-4]], his lost brother who is introduced in the movie. This was done with the reluctant help of Geordi La Forge who voiced concerns about how this could cause B-4 to be nothing more than an exact duplicate of Data.

In ''Star Trek: Picard'', Data is seen in Picard's dreams, playing poker with him in Ten-Forward, and later painting in the middle of the vineyards of Chateau Picard. It is revealed that Dahj and Soji Asha are Data's daughters through fractal neuronic cloning, a procedure developed by Dr. [[Bruce Maddox]]. His consciousness exists inside a quantum simulation crafted by Maddox and based upon memories retrieved from the neurons Maddox salvaged from B-4. Since Data's memories only extend as far as the moment he implanted his memories into B-4, he lacks the memory of sacrificing himself to save Picard. After Picard dies, and while Dr. Altan Soong transfers Picard's consciousness into a golem intended for his own consciousness, Picard meets with Data inside the simulation. Data requests that Picard terminate his consciousness, which would allow Data the experience of living, however briefly. Once Picard awakens, he carries out Data's wish and Data's consciousness rapidly ages to death.

===Characteristics===
Data is immune to nearly all biological diseases and other weaknesses that can affect humans and other carbon-based lifeforms. This benefits the ''Enterprise'' many times, such as when Data is the [[Night Terrors (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|only crew member unaffected by the inability to dream]] and [[Clues (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|the only member to be unaffected by the stun ray that knocked the crew out for a day]]. One exception, however, was in the episode &quot;[[The Naked Now]]&quot; where Data was also a victim of the Tsiolkovsky [[polywater]] virus. Data does not require life support to function and does not register a bio-signature. The crew of the ''Enterprise''-D must modify their scanners to detect positronic signals in order to locate and keep track of him on away-missions. Another unique feature of Data's construction is the ability to be dismantled and then re-assembled for later use. This is used as a plot element in the episode &quot;[[Time's Arrow (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Time's Arrow]]&quot; where Data's head (an artifact excavated on Earth from the late 19th century) is reattached to his body after nearly 500 years. Another example is in the episode &quot;[[Disaster (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Disaster]]&quot;, where Data intentionally damages his body to break a high-current electrical arc, and then Riker takes his head to engineering to solve an engine problem. Data's officer's quarters is unique in that it does not contain a bathing facility or bathroom, instead containing a work station with seats, eventually becoming also occupied by Spot, Data's cat.

Data is vulnerable to technological hazards such as computer viruses, certain levels of energy discharges, ship malfunctions (when connected to the ''Enterprise'' main computer for experiments), and shutdowns whether through remote control shutdown devices or through use of his &quot;off switch&quot;, located on his lower back near where a human kidney would be. Besides Data, very few members of the ''Enterprise'' crew are aware of this switch's existence for reasons of security, including Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Chief Engineer La Forge. Dr. Crusher, who is bound by her Hippocratic Oath forbidding her from divulging this to anyone without Data's express permission, was the first member of the crew to be made aware of its existence in the first-season episode &quot;[[Datalore (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Datalore]]&quot;. Data has also been &quot;possessed&quot; through technological means, such as Ira Graves's transfer of consciousness into his neural net; Dr. Soong's &quot;calling&quot; him; and an alien library that placed several different personalities into him. Data cannot swim unless aided by his built-in flotation device, yet he can perform tasks underwater without the need to surface. Data is also impervious to sensory tactile emotion such as pain or pleasure. In ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' the [[Borg Queen]] grafted artificial skin to his forearm. Data was then able to feel pain when a [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drone slashed at his arm, and pleasure when the Borg Queen blew on the skin's hair follicles. Despite being mechanical in nature, Data is treated as an equal member of the ''Enterprise'' crew in every regard. Being a mechanical construct, technicians such as Chief Engineer [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] prove to be more appropriate to treat his mechanical or cognitive function failures than the ship's doctor. His positronic brain becomes deactivated, repaired, and reactivated by Geordi on several occasions.

Data is physically the strongest member of the ''Enterprise'' crew and also is, in ability to process and calculate information rapidly, the most intelligent member. He is able to survive in atmospheres that most carbon-based life forms would consider inhospitable, including the lack of an atmosphere or the vacuum of space for certain periods of time, though he appears to breathe. As an android, he is the most emotionally challenged and, with the addition of Dr. Soong's emotions chip, the most emotionally unstable member of the crew. Before the emotions chip, Data was unable to grasp basic emotion and imagination, leading him to download personality subroutines into his programming when participating in holographic recreational activities (most notably during Dixon Hill and Sherlock Holmes holoprograms) and during romantic encounters (most notably with [[Tasha Yar]] and [[Jenna D'Sora]]). Yet none of those personalities are his own and are immediately put away at the conclusion of their usefulness. Also, the abilities of Data's hearing are explained in the episodes &quot;[[The Schizoid Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Schizoid Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[A Matter of Time (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|A Matter of Time]]&quot;; his hearing is more sensitive than a dog's and that he can identify several hundred different distinct sound patterns simultaneously, but for aesthetics purposes limits it to about ten. Throughout the series, Data develops a frequently humorous affinity for theatrical acting and singing. This is most definitively demonstrated in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' where Picard and Worf distract an erratically behaving Data by singing two parts of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore|A British Tar]]'', compelling Data to sing the third part.

Because of Julianna Soong's inability to conceive children, Data has at least five&lt;ref&gt;TNG: [[Inheritance (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|&quot;Inheritance&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt; robotic siblings (two of which are Lore and B-4). Later on, his &quot;mother&quot; is revealed also to be his positronic sister as the real Julianna Soong died and was replaced with an identical Soong-type android, the most advanced one that Dr. Soong was known to have built. Data constructed a daughter, which he named &quot;Lal&quot; in the episode &quot;[[The Offspring (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Offspring]]&quot;. This particular android exceeded her father in basic human emotion when she felt fear toward Starfleet's scientific interests in her. Eventually, this was the cause of a cascade failure in her neural net and she died as a result.

In the ''Star Trek'' science fiction universe, Data has a storage capacity of 800 quadrillion bits (which is 100 Petabytes) and can make 60 trillion operations per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Books and comics===
In the comic book miniseries ''[[Star Trek: Countdown]]'' (the official prequel to the reboot ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film), Data, having successfully transferred his positronic pathways and memories into B-4, now commands the ''Enterprise''-E in 2387 in its mission to stop the Romulan Nero. Spock compares Data's &quot;resurrection&quot; with his own [[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|death]] and [[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|return]] years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek: Countdown'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

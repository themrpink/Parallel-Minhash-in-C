===Removal===
{{Main article|Removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950}}

On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kay Matheson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10178854/Kay-Matheson.html |access-date=4 June 2019 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=July 14, 2013 |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Stuart) removed the stone from Westminster Abbey for return to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |title=Blog Archive » Emotion Nationalism And The Brave-Heart Factor |publisher=Ian Hamilton Qc |date=20 January 2008 |access-date=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712235747/http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |archive-date=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the removal process, the stone broke into two pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/25/scotland.britishidentity |title=Film on Stone of Destiny heist 'will end UK' |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2008 |access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Olga Craig |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |newspaper=Telegraph |date=14 Dec 2008 |access-date=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After burying the greater part of the Stone in a [[Kent]] field, where they camped for a few days,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 14Oct2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/14/heritage-scotland |title=The Caledonian job |last=Scott |first=Kirsty |work=The Guardian |date=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; they uncovered the buried stone and returned to Scotland, along with a new accomplice, John Josselyn.

According to one US [[diplomat]] who was posted in [[Edinburgh]] at the time, the stone was hidden for a short time in a trunk in the basement of the consulate's Public Affairs Officer, unknown to him, before it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2014/09/scotland-a-land-apart/ |title=ADST Interview with FSO Robert Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller piece was similarly brought north at a later time. The entire stone was passed to a senior [[Glasgow]] politician, who arranged for it to be professionally repaired by Glasgow [[stonemason]] [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scone-palace.co.uk/palace-grounds/stone-of-destiny|title=The Stone of Destiny|date=2013-07-12|work=Scone Palace Perthshire|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXZDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3896%2C2940043 |title=Offer to repair Stone of Destiny |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=17 September 1974 |page=3 |access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major search for the stone was ordered by the [[British Government]], but proved unsuccessful. The custodians left the stone on the altar of [[Arbroath Abbey]] on 11 April 1951, in the safekeeping of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Once the London police were informed of its whereabouts, the stone was returned to Westminster four months after it had been removed. Afterward, rumours circulated that copies had been made of the stone, and that the returned stone was not the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Richard Blystone|title=Scotland's 'Stone of Scone' finds its way home|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/15/stone.of.scone/|access-date=30 August 2014|work=CNN|date=15 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Halloran|title=The Sad, Dark End of the British Empire|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/the-sad-end-of-the-british-empire-110362_Page2.html#.VAGwX0v5lg0|website=Politico Magazine|access-date=30 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Scotland===
In 1996,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sad&quot; /&gt; in a symbolic response to growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement, the British Government decided that the stone should be kept in Scotland when not in use at coronations. On 3 July 1996, Prime Minister [[John Major]] announced to the House of Commons that the stone would be returned to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12036383.the-return-north-of-jacobs-pillow-may-prove-cold-comfort-to-mr-major-argues-malcolm-dickson-tory-moment-of-destiny/ |title=The return north of Jacob&amp;apos;s pillow may prove cold comfort to Mr Major, argues Malcolm Dickson Tory moment of destiny |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=4 July 1996 |access-date=4 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 1996, after a handover ceremony at the border between representatives of the [[Home Office]] and of the [[Scottish Office]], it was transported to [[Edinburgh Castle]]. An official handover ceremony occurred in the Castle on 30 November 1996, [[St Andrew's Day]], to mark the arrival of the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/scotland-welcomes-the-new-stone-age-1312444.html |title=Scotland welcomes the new Stone age |first=Neal |last=Ascherson |author-link=Neal Ascherson |work=[[The Independent#The Independent on Sunday|The Independent on Sunday]] |date= 1 Dec 1996 |access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], representing Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over the [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] transferring the stone into the safekeeping of the [[Honours of Scotland#Commissioners for the Safekeeping of the Regalia|Commissioners for the Regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/index.php/20-lesser-known-facts-about-the-stone-of-destiny-20-facts-for-20-years |title=20 lesser known facts about the Stone of Destiny – 20 facts for 20 years! - Edinburgh Castle Blog |date=30 November 2016 |access-date= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial of the day: {{Edinburgh Gazette|city=e |issue=24101 |pages=2861–2862 |date=29 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently remains alongside the crown jewels of Scotland, the [[Honours of Scotland]], in the Crown Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.edinburghcastle.scot/see-and-do/highlights/the-stone-of-destiny |title=See and do &gt; highlights &gt; the Stone of Destiny |website= edinburghcastle.scot |access-date=4 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future public display===
The public are to be asked for their views on the preferred future location for public display of the Stone of Scone. Two options have been proposed – featuring as the centrepiece of a proposed new museum in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], a £23m redevelopment of the former Perth City Hall, or remaining at its present location at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in a major redevelopment of the existing display.&lt;ref name=&quot;display&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-49369192 | title=Perth wants Stone of Destiny to return to 'ancestral home' | access-date=16 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is currently the subject of a public consultation published by the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;consultation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://consult.gov.scot/commissioners-for-the-safeguarding-of-the-regalia/the-stone-of-destiny/ | title=The Stone of Destiny | access-date=16 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, homosexual acts are [[LGBT rights by country or territory|legal]] in almost all [[Western countries]], and in many of these countries violence against LGBT people is classified as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;williams&quot;&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of love Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06.

In [[LGBT rights in Europe|Europe]], the [[LGBT rights in the European Union|European Union]]'s [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed &quot;[[sodomy]]&quot;. During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/history-of-the-death-penalty/|title=History of the Death Penalty|last=Reggio|first=Michael|date=1999-02-09|website=PBS Frontline|access-date=2020-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

There was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the [[LGBT in the Middle East|Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and in most of [[Africa]], but also in some of the [[LGBT rights in the Americas#Caribbean|Caribbean]] and [[LGBT rights in Oceania|Oceania]]) with five carrying the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]&quot;ABC News.

[[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]], a country with [[LGBT rights]] protections and legal [[same-sex marriage]], is reported to have the world's highest LGBT murder rate, with more than 380 murders in 2017 alone, an increase of 30% compared to 2016.

==State-sanctioned violence==

===Historic===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|The knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenburg|von Hohenburg]] and his squire, being burned at the stake for sodomy, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]

====The Middle East====
An early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in [[Leviticus]] by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]], prescribing the [[death penalty]]. A violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BCE), stating: &quot;If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]&quot;.

In the account given in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and so was moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as &quot;unnatural prostitutes&quot;; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings &quot;effeminate, cowardly, homosexual&quot;, see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.

====Europe====
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9161.tif|{{Largethumb}}|left|Execution by fire and torture of five homosexual Franciscan friars, Bruges, 26 July 1578]]

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786), punished homosexuality with death.

=====Republican Rome=====
In [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|pathic role in same-sex acts]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted, &quot;if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, &quot;Invading the Roman Body,&quot; in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE,  the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''&quot;When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE,  emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;  Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as &quot;famines, earthquakes, and pestilences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, &quot;Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses,&quot; in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====France and Florence=====
During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forbiddenfriends00rock/page/24 24, 227, 356, 360]|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5|url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenfriends00rock/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;litandhomo&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenburg|Richard von Hohenberg]] (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

=====Malta=====
In seventeenth century [[Malta]], English voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in his diary in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash]]es for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref name=&quot;buttigieg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448|access-date=2018-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416145141/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To escape this fate, about a hundred ''bardassoes'', boy prostitutes, sailed for [[Sicily]] the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;buttigieg&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Great Britain=====
In [[Timeline of LGBT history in Britain|England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1533]] made sodomy and [[bestiality]] punishable by death.  This act was superseded in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861, although the [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835.

=====The Holocaust=====
In [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Occupied Europe]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by [[the Holocaust]] (''See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany]]''). (In 1936, the homosexual [[Federico García Lorca]] was executed by right-wing rebels who established [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship in Spain]], Hitler's ally.)

Even in countries where homosexuality is legal (most countries outside of Africa and the Middle East), there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide.

{{further|Homophobic violence in Brazil}}
According to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name=&quot;globo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha - Jornal O Globo |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 387 LGBT Brazilians were murdered in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Violent deaths of LGBT people in Brazil hit all-time high |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research |work=The Guardian |date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazilian gay group [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were [[trans women]] or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030115100/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 |date=2010-10-30 }} (ipsnews.net, 22 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|United States]] during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the [[right-wing]] [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology &quot;unscientific&quot; based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and [[LGBT rights in the United States|United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: &quot;an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims&quot;.
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. &quot;They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALTS&quot;/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because &quot;he was a faggot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;

In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827144817/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org//pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|archive-date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Table 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt;

People's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suri|first1=Manveena|title=Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate - students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Waling|first1=Andrea|last2=Roffee|first2=James A|date=2018-03-30|title=Supporting LGBTIQ+ students in higher education in Australia: Diversity, inclusion and visibility|journal=Health Education Journal|language=en|volume=77|issue=6|pages=667–679|doi=10.1177/0017896918762233|s2cid=80302675|issn=0017-8969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence at universities ===
In the United States during the past few years, colleges and universities have taken major steps to prevent sexual harassment from taking place on campus, but students have reported violence due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED564604|title=A Hidden Crisis: Including the LGBT Community When Addressing Sexual Violence on College Campuses|last1=Pérez|first1=Zenen Jaimes|last2=Hussey|first2=Hannah|date=2014-09-19|publisher=Center for American Progress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment can include &quot;non-contact forms&quot; such as making jokes or comments and &quot;contact forms&quot; like forcing students to commit sexual acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez&quot;/&gt; Even though little information exists with LGBT violence taking place at higher learning institutions, different communities are taking a stand against the violence. Many LGBT rape survivors said they experienced their first assault before the age of 25, and that many arrive on campus with this experience. Almost half of bi-sexual women experience their first assault between the ages of 18-24, and most of these take place unreported on college campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez&quot;/&gt; Though the Federal Bureau of Investigation changed what the &quot;federal&quot; definition of what rape means (for reporting purposes) in 2012, local state governments still determine how campus violence cases are treated. Catherine Hill and Elana Silva said in ''Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus,''&quot;Students who admit to harassing other students generally don't see themselves as rejected suitors, rather misunderstood comedians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED489850|title=Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus|last1=Hill|first1=Catherine|last2=Silva|first2=Elena|date=2005|publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 1111 Sixteenth St|isbn=9781879922358|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students who commit sexual violence towards other students do it to boost their own ego, believing that their actions are humorous. More than 46% of sexual harassment towards LGBT people still goes unreported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;/&gt; National resources have been created to deal with the issue of sexual violence and various organizations such as The American Association of University Women and the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence are established to provide information and resources for those who have been sexually harassed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;/&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}}
Members of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bello|first1=Barbara Giovanna|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol K.|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=662–665|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA664|accessdate=22 February 2018|chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT history in the United States|United States]] does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79-70 to remove &quot;sexual orientation&quot; from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with &quot;discriminatory reasons on any basis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|newspaper=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010|access-date=2018-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603081710/http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|archive-date=2016-06-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRF&quot;/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gay-community-troubled-by-release-of-killer-in-stanley-park-death-1.776449|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

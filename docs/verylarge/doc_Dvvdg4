The hair easily enter buildings through ventilation systems and accumulate in indoor environments because of their small size, which makes it difficult for them to be vented out.

In the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]] caterpillars are feared as pest that devour crops. They are part of the &quot;pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Kings|8:37|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their association with the [[locust]], thus they are one of the plagues of Egypt. [[Jeremiah]] names them as one of the inhabitants of [[Babylon]]. The English word caterpillar derives from the old French ''catepelose'' (hairy cat) but merged with the ''piller'' (pillager). Caterpillars became a symbol for social dependents. [[Shakespeare]]'s Bolingbroke described [[Richard III (play)|King Richard]]'s friends as &quot;The caterpillars of the commonwealth, Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away&quot;. In 1790 [[William Blake]] referenced this popular image in [[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]] when he attacked priests: &quot;as the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lay his curse on the fairest joys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Literary Symbols|author=Michael Ferber|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781316780978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of caterpillars in the life stages of butterflies was badly understood. In 1679 [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] published the first volume of ''The Caterpillars' Marvelous Transformation and Strange Floral Food'', which contained 50 illustrations and a description of insects, moths, butterflies and their [[larvae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editor1=Donna Spalding Andréolle |editor2=Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier popular publication on moths and butterflies, and their caterpillars, by [[Jan Goedart]] had not included eggs in the life stages of European moths and butterflies, because he had believed that caterpillars were generated from water. When Merian published her study of caterpillars it was still widely believed that insects were spontaneously generated. Merian's illustrations supported the findings of [[Francesco Redi]], [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editor1=Donna Spalding Andréolle |editor2=Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies were regarded as symbol for the human soul since ancient time, and also in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Serpent and the Swan: The Animal Bride in Folklore and Literature|author=Boria Sax|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=1998|isbn=9780939923687|pages=[https://archive.org/details/serpentswananima00saxb/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/serpentswananima00saxb/page/70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goedart thus located his empirical observations on the transformation of caterpillars into  butterflies in the Christian tradition. As such he argued that the metamorphosis from caterpillar into butterfly was a symbol, and even proof, of Christ's resurrection. He argued &quot;that from dead caterpillars emerge living animals; so it is equally true and miraculous, that our dead and rotten corpses will rise from the grave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts|author1=Karl A. E. Enenkel |author2=Mark S. Smith|publisher=BRILL|year=2007|isbn=9789047422365|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swammerdam, who in 1669 had demonstrated that inside a caterpillar  the rudiments of the future butterfly's limbs and wings could be discerned, attacked the mystical and religious notion that the caterpillar died and the butterfly subsequently resurrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts|author1=Karl A.

Smith|publisher=BRILL|year=2007|isbn=9789047422365|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a militant [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]], Swammerdam attacked Goedart as ridiculous, and when publishing his findings he proclaimed &quot;here we witness the digression of those who have tried to prove Resurrection of the Dead from these obviously natural and comprehensible changes within the creature itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts|author1=Karl A.

Since then the metamorphoses of the caterpillar into a butterfly has in Western societies been associated with countless human transformations in folktales and literature. There is no process in the physical life of human beings that resembles this metamorphoses, and the symbol of the caterpillar tends to depict a psychic transformation of a human. As such the caterpillar has in the Christian tradition become a metaphor for being &quot;born again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Serpent and the Swan: The Animal Bride in Folklore and Literature|author=Boria Sax|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=1998|isbn=9780939923687|pages=[https://archive.org/details/serpentswananima00saxb/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/serpentswananima00saxb/page/71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famously, in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]] a caterpillar asks Alice &quot;Who are you?&quot;. When Alice comments on the caterpillar's inevitable transformation into a butterfly, the caterpillar champions the position that in spite of changes it is still possible to know something, and that Alice is the same Alice at the beginning and end of a considerable interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behind the Looking Glass|author=Sherry Ackerman|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443804561|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Caterpillar asks Alice to clarify a point, the child replies &quot;I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly... for I can't but understand it myself, to begin with, and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing&quot;. Here Carroll satirizes [[René Descartes]], the founder of Cartesian philosophy, and his theory on innate ideas. Descartes argued that we are distracted by urgent bodily stimuli that swamp the human mind in childhood. Descartes also theorised that inherited preconceived opinions obstruct the human [[perception]] of the [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behind the Looking Glass|author=Sherry Ackerman|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443804561|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent symbolic references to caterpillars in popular media include the [[Mad Men (season 3)|''Mad Men'' season 3]] episode &quot;The Fog&quot;, in which [[Betty Draper]] has a drug-induced dream, while in labor, that she captures a caterpillar and holds it firmly in her hand.&lt;ref&gt;What's Alan Watching?: ''Mad Men'', &quot;The Fog&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Sopranos (season 5)|''The Sopranos'' season 5]] episode &quot;[[The Test Dream]]&quot;, [[Tony Soprano]] dreams that [[Ralph Cifaretto]] has a caterpillar on his bald head that changes into a butterfly.

'''Butterflies''' are [[insect]]s in the [[macrolepidoptera]]n [[clade]] Rhopalocera from the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Lepidoptera]], which also includes [[moth]]s. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large [[superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] [[Papilionoidea]], which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily &quot;Hesperioidea&quot;), and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily &quot;Hedyloidea&quot;). Butterfly fossils date to the [[Paleocene]], about 56 million years ago.

Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their [[larva]]e, known as [[caterpillar]]s, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, [[pupa]]te in a [[chrysalis]]. When [[metamorphosis]] is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.

Butterflies are often [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]], and many species make use of [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]] and [[aposematism]] to evade their predators. Some, like the [[Monarch (butterfly)|monarch]] and the [[Vanessa cardui|painted lady]], [[Insect migration|migrate]] over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by [[parasite]]s or [[parasitoid]]s, including [[parasitoid wasp|wasps]], [[protozoa]]ns, [[Fly|flies]], and other invertebrates, or are [[Predation|preyed upon]] by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of [[pollination]] of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., [[Miletinae|harvesters]]) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of [[ant]]s, while others live as [[mutualism (biology)|mutualists]] in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.

==Etymology==
[[File:Common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni) male in flight.jpg|thumb|The original &quot;butter-fly&quot;?&lt;ref name=BugsBritannica/&gt; A male brimstone (''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]'') in flight]]

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' derives the word straightforwardly from [[Old English]] ''butorflēoge'', butter-fly; similar names in [[Old Dutch]] and [[Old High German]] show that the name is ancient. A possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]''); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing.&lt;ref name=BugsBritannica&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marren |first1=Peter |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |title=Bugs Britannica |date=2010 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |isbn=978-0-7011-8180-2 |pages=196–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald A.

Traditionally, butterflies have been divided into the [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] [[Papilionoidea]] excluding the smaller groups of the [[Hesperiidae]] (skippers) and the more moth-like [[Hedylidae]] of America. [[phylogeny|Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to the other two groups, so they should both be included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade '''Rhopalocera'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heikkilä | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaila | first2 = L. | last3 = Mutanen | first3 = M. | last4 = Peña | first4 = C. | last5 = Wahlberg | first5 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Cretaceous Origin and Repeated Tertiary Diversification of the Redefined Butterflies | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = 1731| pages = 1093–1099 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1430 | pmid=21920981 | pmc=3267136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kawahara | first1 = A.

Butterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name ([[Ancient Greek]] λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with [[melanin]]s that give them blacks and browns, as well as [[uric acid]] derivatives and [[flavones]] that give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and [[Iridescence|iridescent colours]] are created by [[structural coloration]] produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=C.

As in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]], and [[abdomen]]. The thorax is composed of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of [[moth]]s which may be threadlike or feathery.

Butterfly [[larva]]e, [[caterpillar]]s, have a hard ([[Sclerotin|sclerotised]]) head with strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have cylindrical bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each.&lt;ref name=Gullan/&gt; Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The [[pupa]] or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.&lt;ref name=Gullan/&gt;

Many butterflies are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Most butterflies have the [[ZW sex-determination system]] where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9292232 |date=August 1997 |last1=Traut |first1=W. |last2=Marec |first2=F. |title=Sex Chromosome Differentiation in Some Species of Lepidoptera (Insecta) |volume=5 |issue=5|pages=283–91 |issn=0967-3849 |doi=10.1023/B:CHRO.0000038758.08263.c3 |journal=Chromosome Research: An International Journal on the Molecular, Supramolecular and Evolutionary Aspects of Chromosome Biology|s2cid=21995492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; [[egg]], [[larva]] (caterpillar), [[pupa]] (chrysalis) and [[imago]] (adult). In the genera ''[[Colias]]'', ''[[Erebia]]'', ''[[Euchloe]]'', and ''Parnassius'', a small number of species are known that reproduce [[Parthenogenesis|semi-parthenogenetically]]; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.&lt;ref name=Capinera640/&gt;

====Egg====
[[File:2012-06-27 Aporia crataegi eggs Malus domestica.JPG|thumb|left|Eggs of black-veined white (''[[Aporia crataegi]]'') on [[apple]] leaf]]
[[File:Butterfly laying eggs underneath a leaf.jpg|thumb|A butterfly laying eggs underneath the leaf]]

Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the ''chorion''. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called ''micropyles''; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.&lt;ref name=Capinera640&gt;{{cite book |author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA640 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of ''[[Pieris brassicae]]'', it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beament, J.W.L. |author2=Lal, R. |year=1957 |title=Penetration Through the Egg-shell of ''Pieris brassicae'' |journal=Bulletin of Entomological Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=109–125 |doi=10.1017/S0007485300054134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterflies in the genus ''[[Agathymus]]'' do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.&lt;ref name=Scott121&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott, James A. |title=The Butterflies of North America: A Natural History and Field Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oa5m8gZcGjMC&amp;pg=PA121 |year=1992 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2013-7 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggs are almost invariably laid on plants. Each species of butterfly has its own host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA676 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as the [[great spangled fritillary]], the eggs are deposited close to but not on the food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do [[Viola (plant)|violets]] in this example.&lt;ref name=Shepard55&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shepard, Jon |author2=Guppy, Crispin |title=Butterflies of British Columbia: Including Western Alberta, Southern Yukon, the Alaska Panhandle, Washington, Northern Oregon, Northern Idaho, and Northwestern Montana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=il6rJ7glHNQC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=2011 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0-7748-4437-6 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, especially in temperate regions, go through a [[diapause]] (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Butterflies: Education: Butterflies in Winter |url=http://www.britishbutterflies.co.uk/winter.asp |access-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107044348/http://www.britishbutterflies.co.uk/winter.asp |archive-date=7 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temperate region butterflies, such as the [[Nymphalis antiopa|Camberwell beauty]], lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camberwell Beauty |url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/perhoset/camberwell-beauty |publisher=NatureGate |access-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421061806/http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/perhoset/camberwell-beauty |archive-date=21 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

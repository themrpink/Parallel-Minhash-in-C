Later, international evaluations [[TIMSS]] and [[PISA]] showed a sharp improvement in the areas of math, reading and science from 2006 to 2015. Portuguese students results raised to above [[OECD]] and IEA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.nl|title=International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt; averages, attaining the best results ever for Portugal. The PISA reading results moved from 472 to 498, above the US at 497. However, by 2018 Portugal had dropped slightly to 492 and the USA had increased to 505. Some analysts explain these advances by the educational measures Portugal put in place: a more demanding curricula, the emphasis on direct teaching, standardized testing, less ability streaming, and explicit fluency training in reading and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21711247-reforming-education-slow-and-hard-eminently-possible-what-world-can-learn|title=Reforming education slow and hard, eminently possible, The Economist. 2016-12-10. ISSN 0013-0613. Retrieved 2020-04-30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, amongst 50 countries, Portugal achieved the 30th highest score in Reading Literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS reading achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===

Phonics is widely used to teach reading in the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/russian-federation/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/ |title=Language/Reading Curriculum in the Fourth Grade, Russia, PIRLS 2016 Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a method developed in the 1960s by Soviet psychologist and educator Daniil Borissowitsch Elkonin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q328350 |title= Daniil Elkonin, wikidata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known as the pioneer of the [[Elkonin boxes]] that are used in Russia and other countries to teach [[phonological awareness]]. Children are taught the [[phonetic]] system of the [[Russian language]] by learning the sequence and characteristics of the sounds in a word, before studying the [[Russian alphabet]].

According to one report, there is some debate in the Russian Federation about phonics vs. whole language, however Olga Viktorovna Pronina, an author and teacher in Moscow, said “Today, most teachers in Russia would tell you they use phonics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-03-04-1998063127-story.html |title=Russia has phonics debate, Baltimore Sun, 1998-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst 50 countries, the Russian Federation achieved the highest score (581) in ''Reading Literacy'' for fourth graders according to the 2016 [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/wp-content/uploads/structure/PIRLS/3.-achievement-in-purposes-and-comprehension-processes/3_1_achievement-in-reading-purposes.pdf|title=Exhibit 3.1: Achievement in Reading Purposes, 2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teachermagazine.com.au/articles/pirls-2016-russias-reading-success|title= PIRLS 2016: Russia's reading success, Teacher Magazine, 2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th grade it is assumed that children know how to read, so the PIRLS ''Reading Literacy'' has two components: ''Literary'' (reading narrative fiction), and ''Informational'' (reading informational text with facts, lists, charts, graphs, and diagrams, etc.).

=== Scotland ===

Synthetic phonics in Scotland has its roots in the Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005. It compared analytic Phonics with synthetic Phonics and advantaged students with disadvantaged children. The report found that, using synthetic phonics, children from lower socio-economic backgrounds performed at the same level as children from advantaged backgrounds in primary school (whereas with analytic phonics teaching, they did significantly less well.); and boys performed better than or as well as girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20170701074158/http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|title=Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005, webarchive.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year follow-up of the study concluded that the beneficial effects were long-lasting, in fact the reading gains increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/4938/1/nls_phonics0303rjohnston.pdf|title=Accelerating Reading and Spelling with Synthetic Phonics: A Five Year Follow Up, Johnston &amp; Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, [[Education Scotland]] concluded that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4–7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than [[analytic phonics]] programs; however it is most important to teach systematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.gov.scot/improvement/pages/EEF-Toolkit-Results.aspx?911459f09ef0012d8e7c32f03e32d003d881d45febd1eba332753219e922d8f5|title=National Improvement Hub:Phonics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[PISA]] 2018 reading results of 15-year-old students, Scotland's score was above average, 504 as compared to the [[OECD]] average of 487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/28450521-en.pdf?expires=1592595146&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7B88AF82F7B774AD08D0C997C3CF5601|title=PISA results, 2018 Table 1.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland does not participate in [[PIRLS]].

===Singapore===

[[Singapore]] has a diverse language environment with four official languages including English which is the language of education and administration. [[Bilingualism]] is the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the education system where students learn both English and their own mother tongue language in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/singapore/reading-instruction-in-the-primary-grades/|title=Singapore reading instruction, primary grades, PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 99% of children attend preschool education (as early as 18 months of age) although it is not compulsory in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/countries/singapore/overview-of-education-system/|title=Overview of educucation system in Singapore, PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 English Language Syllabus of Singapore advocated &quot;a balance between decoding and meaning-based instruction … phonics and whole language&quot;. However, a review in 2006 advocated for a &quot;systematic&quot; approach. The subsequent syllabus, in 2010, had no mention of whole language and recommended a balanced, interactive and comprehensive reading programme. It refers to ''Learning to Read: The Great Debate'' by [[Jeanne Chall]] (1967) and the [[National Reading Panel]] (2000) both of which supported systematic phonics; and the [[International Literacy Association]] (2005) that supported balanced instruction saying phonics is &quot;necessary but insufficient&quot;.

The syllabus for 2010 advocates for a balance between &quot;systematic and explicit instruction&quot; and &quot;a rich language environment&quot;. It called for increased instruction in oral language skills together with phonemic awareness and the key decoding elements of synthetic phonics, analytic phonics and analogy phonics. Specifically, it advocated for instruction in phonic's areas such as word families and rimes (e.g. '''jump'''s and '''jump'''ed; b'''ite''' and k'''ite'''), segmenting and blending (e.g. {{IPAc-en|k}}, {{IPAc-en|æ}}, {{IPAc-en|t}}= cat), vowels, consonants and syllables. And finally, it called for instruction in word study, grammar, vocabulary, writing and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/syllabuses/english-language-and-literature/files/english-primary-secondary-express-normal-academic.pdf|title=2010 English language syllabus, Minister of Education, Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore received the second highest reading score (576) after the Russian Federation  (581) in the 2016 [[PIRLS]] report on grade four students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS 2016 student achievement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===

Since the 1860s it was &quot;taken for granted&quot; that phonics is a major part of reading instruction in the first school years in [[Sweden]]. However,  in the 1990s the [[National Agency for Education (Sweden)]] encouraged teachers to try other methods, including [[whole language]].

Sweden's performance in the international fourth grade reading assessments ([[PIRLS]]) dropped by 19 points from 2001 (561) to 2011 (542) and recovered by 13 points in 2016 (555), still lower than the 2001 results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/trends-in-reading-achievement/|title=PIRLS Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that the lower scores are related to the increase in immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/immigrant-children-in-sweden-blamed-for-countrys-poor-test-scores-a6934111.html|title=Immigrant children in Sweden blamed for country's poor test scores, Independent, 2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the European Literacy Policy Network (ELINET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eli-net.eu|title=European Literacy Policy Network (ELINET)}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a report on literacy in Sweden saying there is an “urgent need” to address decreases in performance as measured by PIRLS and [[PISA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elinet.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Sweden_Long_Report.pdf|title=LITERACY IN SWEDEN, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Reading education in the United States}}
As a matter of interest, in 2016 amongst 50 countries, the USA achieved the 15th highest score in Reading Literacy for fourth graders according to the [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/pirls-achievement-results/|title=PIRLS reading achievement 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 78 countries, the USA ranked 14th in reading for the international [[PISA]] study for 15-year-old students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/PISA2018_CN_USA.pdf|title=USA in PISA, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, 34% of grade-four public school students in the USA (Nationally) met the reading standards of the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|Nations Report Card]] (NAEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading/states/achievement/?grade=4|title=The NAEP nation's report card}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a century of debate has occurred over whether English phonics should or should not be used in teaching beginning reading.

The use of phonics in education in the [[United States]] dates at least to the work of [[Favell Lee Mortimer]], whose works using phonics includes the early [[flashcard]] set ''Reading Disentangled'' (1834)&lt;ref&gt;''The Clumsiest People in Europe: Or, Mrs. Mortimer's Bad-Tempered Guide to the Victorian World,'' [[Favell Lee Mortimer]], foreword by Todd Pruzan, 2006 edition, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_AC9ae6lzkC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=favell+mortimer+phonics p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; and text ''Reading Without Tears'' (1857). Despite the work of 19th-century proponents such as [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]], some American educators, prominently [[Horace Mann]], argued that phonics should not be taught at all. This led to the commonly used &quot;[[look-say]]&quot; approach ensconced in the ''[[Dick and Jane]]'' readers popular in the mid-20th century. Beginning in the 1950s, however, inspired by a landmark study by Dr. Harry E. Houtz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-LEDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Dr.+Harry+E.+Houtz+education&amp;pg=PA232|title=Literacy &amp; Education, Ryker Kirk 2018, page 232|isbn=9781839472275|last1=Kirk|first1=Ryker|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spurred by [[Rudolf Flesch]]'s criticism of the absence of phonics instruction (particularly in his book, ''[[Why Johnny Can't Read]]''- 1955) and [[Jeanne Chall]] (the author of ''Learning to Read the Great Debate'' - 1967-1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning to Read: The Great Debate, 1967-1995|author=Jeanne S. Chall|year=1996|isbn=0155030809}}&lt;/ref&gt; phonics resurfaced as a method of teaching reading.

In the 1980s, the &quot;[[whole language]]&quot; approach to reading further polarized the debate in the United States. Whole language instruction was predicated on the principle that children could learn to read given (a) proper [[motivation]], (b) access to good [[literature]], (c) many reading opportunities, (d) focus on meaning, and (e) instruction to help students use semantic, syntactic and graphophonic cues to &quot;guess&quot; the pronunciation of unknown words. Also, in practice children are often taught to use pictures to guess a word. For some advocates of whole language, phonics was antithetical to helping new readers to get the meaning; they asserted that parsing words into small chunks and reassembling them had no connection to the ideas the author wanted to convey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A psycholinguistic guessing game|journal=Journal of the Reading Specialist|volume=6|issue=4|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/19388076709556976|year = 1967|last1 = Goodman|first1 = Kenneth S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole language emphasis on identifying words using context and focusing only a little on the sounds (usually the alphabet consonants and the short vowels) could not be reconciled with the phonics emphasis on individual sound-symbol correspondences. Thus, a dichotomy between the whole language approach and phonics emerged in the United States causing intense debate. Ultimately, this debate led to a series of [[United States Congress|Congressionally]]-commissioned panels and government-funded reviews of the state of reading instruction in the U.S.

In 1984, the [[National Academy of Education]] commissioned a report on the status of research and instructional practices in reading education, ''Becoming a Nation of Readers''.&lt;ref&gt;''Becoming a Nation of Readers'', National Academy of Education, Center for the Study of Reading, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Among other results, the report includes the finding that phonics instruction improves children's ability to identify words. It reports that useful phonics strategies include teaching children the sounds of letters in isolation and in words, and teaching them to blend the sounds of letters together to produce approximate pronunciations of words. It also states that phonics instruction should occur in conjunction with opportunities to identify words in meaningful sentences and stories.

In 1990, Congress asked the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) to compile a list of available programs on beginning reading instruction, evaluating each in terms of the effectiveness of its phonics component. As part of this requirement, the ED asked [[Marilyn Jager Adams|Dr. Marilyn J. Adams]] to produce a report on the role of phonics instruction in beginning reading. This resulted in her 1994 book ''Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager|title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA 
|isbn=978-0-262-51076-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/beginningtoread00mari}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Adams asserted that existing scientific research supported that phonics is an effective way to teach students the ''alphabetic code'' - building their skills in decoding unknown words. By learning the alphabetic code, she argued, students can free up mental energy used for word analysis and devote this mental effort to meaning, leading to stronger comprehension. Furthermore, she suggested that students be encouraged ''not'' to skip words they find difficult. Instead they should take the time to study the challenging words and to reread sentences after they have succeeded in decoding them. She also concluded that while phonics instruction is a necessary component of reading instruction, it is not sufficient by itself. Children should also have practice reading text provided they do not make too many mistakes. In spite of her study, the argument about how to teach reading eventually known as &quot;the Great Debate,&quot; continued unabated.

In 1996 the [[California]] Department of Education took an increased interest in using phonics in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/22/us/california-leads-revival-of-teaching-by-phonics.html|title= NY Times 1996, California Leads Revival Of Teaching by Phonics}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1997 the department called for grade one teaching in concepts about print, phonemic awareness, decoding and word recognition, and vocabulary and concept development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/elacontentstnds.pdf|title= English–Language Arts Content Standards for California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Congress asked the Director of the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) at the [[National Institutes of Health]], in consultation with the [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], to convene a national panel to assess the effectiveness of different approaches used to teach children to read.

The [[U.S. National Research Council|National Research Council]] re-examined the question of how best to teach reading to children (among other questions in education) and in 1998 published the results in the ''Prevention of Reading Difficulties in Young Children.''&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Catherine E., Susan Burns, Peg Griffin, eds. ''Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children''. Committee on the Prevention of Reading Difficulties in Young Children, National Research Council, 1998 {{ISBN|0-309-06418-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Research Council's findings largely matched those of Adams. They concluded that phonics is a very effective way to teach children to read at the word level, more effective than what is known as the &quot;embedded phonics&quot; approach of whole language (where phonics was taught opportunistically in the context of literature). They found that phonics instruction must be systematic (following a sequence of increasingly challenging phonics patterns) and explicit (teaching students precisely how the patterns worked, e.g., &quot;this is ''b'', it stands for the /b/ sound&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ziegler JC, Goswami U |title=Reading acquisition, developmental dyslexia, and skilled reading across languages: a psycholinguistic grain size theory |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=3–29 |date = January 2005|pmid=15631549 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the findings of the [[National Reading Panel]] was published. It examined quantitative research studies on many areas of reading instruction, including phonics and whole language. The resulting report ''Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction'' provides a comprehensive review of what is known about best practices in reading instruction in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf|title=National reading panel, nichd.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel reported that several reading skills are critical to becoming good readers: phonemic awareness, phonics for word identification, fluency, vocabulary and text comprehension. With regard to phonics, their meta-analysis of hundreds of studies confirmed the findings of the National Research Council: teaching phonics (and related phonics skills, such as phonemic awareness) is a more effective way to teach children early reading skills than is embedded phonics or no phonics instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The panel found that phonics instruction is an effective method of teaching reading for students from kindergarten through 6th grade, and for all children who are having difficulty learning to read. They also found that phonics instruction benefits all ages in learning to spell. They also reported that teachers need more education about effective reading instruction, both pre-service and in-service.

The State driven [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] was developed in 2009, because of a lack of standardization of education principles and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org|title=Common Core State Standards Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has a comprehensive description of the specific details of the English Language Arts Standards that include the areas of the Alphabetic Principle, Print Concepts, Phonological Awareness, Phonics and Word Recognition, and Fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RF/introduction/|title= English Language Arts Standards, Reading – Foundational Skills, K-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the individual States and School Districts to develop plans to implement the standards. As of 2020, 41 States had adopted the standards, and in most cases it has taken three or more years to have them implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in your state}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Wisconsin]] adopted the standards in 2010, implemented them in the 2014–2015 school year, yet in 2020 the state Department of Public Instruction was in the process of developing materials to support the standards in teaching phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2020/01/22/wisconsin-dpi-endorses-explicit-phonics-instruction-reading/4543737002/|title= DPI endorses 'explicit phonics instruction' as critical component of reading instruction, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 2020-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dpi.wi.gov/standards|title=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State of Mississippi]] passed the Literacy-Based Promotion Act in 2013 in part because of the States' poor showing in the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legiscan.com/MS/text/SB2157/id/1390375|title=Literacy-Based Promotion Act, Mississippi Senate Bill 2157,2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bdtonline.com/opinion/from-the-opinion-page-literacy-and-phonics-are-and-should-be-among-america-s-top/article_79a291d2-9e22-11ea-809a-c3bf323a44a1.html|title=OPINION PAGE: Literacy and phonics are, and should be, among America's top issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mississippi Department of Education]] provides resources for teachers in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension and reading strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mdek12.org/ESE/literacy/professional-development-and-resources-for-teachers|title=Professional Development and Resources for Teachers, Mississippi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019 Mississippi made a bigger advance in reading than any other State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/reading/2019/|title=Nations report card}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/mississippi-schools-naep.html|title=Opinion, Mississippi schools, NT Times, 2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the California Department of Education stated &quot;Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial&quot;. It goes on to say that &quot;Learners need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter3.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter4.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Pedagogy Grades Two and Three, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the New York State Public School system began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving &quot;reading or literacy experiences&quot; as well as [[phonemic awareness]] from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Ohio Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics as a technique in teaching reading. It includes guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Operating-Standards/Table-of-Contents/Instruction/Phonics|title=Rules for Phonics, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Early-Learning/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-District-Resources/Approved-List-of-Research-Based-Reading-Instructio/Reading_Competencies.pdf.aspx|title=Reading Competencies, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Literacy/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-Teacher-Resources|title=Third grade reading guarantee, Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the Ohio Department of Education adopted new learning standards for English Language Arts. They include ''Reading Standards for Foundational Skills K–12'' that clearly lay out a systematic approach to teaching ''phonological awareness'' in kindergarten and grade one, and ''grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words'' (including fluency and comprehension) in grades one through five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/English-Language-Art/English-Language-Arts-Standards/ELA-Learning-Standards-2017.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US|title=Reading Standards for Foundational Skills K–12, OHIO Department of Education, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the What Works Clearinghouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/|title=What Works Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institute of Education Sciences]], an independent and non-partisan arm of the [[U.S. Department of Education]], published an Educator's Practice Guide (with evidence) on Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Docs/PracticeGuide/wwc_foundationalreading_070516.pdf|title=What works clearinghouse: Educator's Practice Guide on Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade, 2016, Institute of Education Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains four recommendations to support reading: 1) Teach students academic language skills, including the use of inferential and narrative language, and vocabulary knowledge, 2) Develop awareness of the segments of sounds in speech and how they link to letters (phonemic awareness and phonics), 3) Teach students to decode words, analyze word parts, and write and recognize words (phonics and synthetic phonics), and 4) Ensure that each student reads connected text every day to support reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension.

In 2016, [[Colorado Department of Education]] updated their Elementary Teacher Literacy Standards with a comprehensive outline including standards for development in the areas Phonology; Phonics and Word Recognition; Fluent Automatic Reading; Vocabulary; Text Comprehension; and Handwriting, Spelling, and Written Expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.state.co.us/coloradoliteracy/elementaryteacher-literacystandards|title=Elementary Teacher Literacy Standards, COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, research published in the [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] has shown that learning to read by sounding out words (i.e. phonics) has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of reading aloud and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comparing and validating methods of reading instruction using behavioural and neural findings in an artificial orthography. Taylor JSH, Davis MH, Rastle K.|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology. General|volume = 146|issue = 6|pages = 826–858|pmc = 5458780|year = 2017|last1 = Taylor|first1 = J. S.|last2 = Davis|first2 = M. H.|last3 = Rastle|first3 = K.|pmid = 28425742|doi = 10.1037/xge0000301}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes that early literacy education should focus on the systematic approach in &quot;print-to-sound relationships&quot; in alphabetic languages, rather than teaching &quot;meaning-based strategies&quot;, in order to enhance both reading aloud and comprehension of written words.

In 2018 The [[Association for Psychological Science]] published an article entitled ''Ending the Reading Wars: Reading Acquisition From Novice to Expert''. The purpose of the article is to fill the gap between the current research knowledge and the public understanding about how we learn to read, and to explain &quot;why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ending the Reading Wars: Reading Acquisition From Novice to Expert, The Association for Psychological Science, 2018.|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–51|doi=10.1177/1529100618772271|pmid=29890888|year = 2018|last1 = Castles|first1 = Anne|last2=Rastle|first2=Kathleen|last3=Nation|first3=Kate|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Arkansas Department of Education]], Literacy Support Unit, published a report about their new initiative known as R.I.S.E., Reading Initiative for Student Excellence, that was the result of The Right to Read Act, passed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Learning_Services/RISE/RISE_Arkansas/RISE_Arkansas_2018_Report_REV2.pdf|title=A New Chapter for Arkansas Students, 2018 Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first goal of this initiative is to provide educators with the in-depth knowledge and skills of &quot;the science of reading&quot; and evidence-based instructional strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dese.ade.arkansas.gov/public/userfiles/Learning_Services/RISE/SCIENCE_OF_READING.pdf|title=The Science of Reading, RISE, Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a change of focus to research-based instruction on phonological awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Specific requirements are that reading instruction be systematic and explicit, and include decoding techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansased.gov/divisions/learning-services/r.i.s.e.-arkansas/its-all-about-meaning|title=It's all About Meaning, arkansased.gov/divisions/learning-services, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the instruction involves the use of a book and study guide entitled Essentials of Assessing, Preventing and Overcoming Reading Difficulties, by David Kilpatrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Learning_Services/RISE/It_s_All_About_Meaning/Book_Study_Facilitator_Guide.pdf|title= Essentials of Assessing, Preventing and Overcoming Reading Difficulties, David Kilpatrick, cortland.edu, arkansased.gov/public/userfiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Minnesota Reading Corps (MRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://minnesotareadingcorps.org/the-challenge/|title= Minnesota Reading Corp, Our Work}}&lt;/ref&gt; published impact evaluation reports of their reading programs for children in pre-kindergarten to grade three (2017–2018). MRC is a participating organization under [[Americorps]] in which volunteers tutor at-risk students who need extra support in reading and math. The tutors are trained to use research-based literacy activities and interventions as identified by the [[National Reading Panel]], including phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The reports, presented by [[NORC at the University of Chicago]], compare the results of students in the MRC program with students in control groups. They found that MRC kindergarten students achieved significantly higher scores in letter-sound fluency, and MRC first grade students achieved significantly higher scores in both [[nonsense word]] fluency and oral reading [[fluency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://1kvjxp28gemz2aa4gi2qmxxh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Minnesota-Reading-Corps_2017-2018-Evaluation_Full-Report-FINAL.pdf|title=Final Report, Impact Evaluation of the Minnesota Reading Corps K-3 Program (2017–18)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 the [[Minnesota Department of Education]] introduced standards requiring school districts to &quot;develop a Local Literacy Plan to ensure that all students have achieved early reading proficiency by no later than the end of third grade&quot; in accordance with a Statute of the [[Minnesota Legislature]] requiring elementary teachers to be able to implement comprehensive, [[Evidence-based education|scientifically based reading]] and oral language instruction in the five reading areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/120B.12 |title=MN Statute 120B.12, 2019, READING PROFICIENTLY NO LATER THAN THE END OF GRADE 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/stds/|title= MN Department of Education Academic Standards (K-12), 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 the [[International Literacy Association]] released a report entitled Meeting the Challenges of Early Literacy Phonics Instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.literacyworldwide.org/docs/default-source/where-we-stand/ila-meeting-challenges-early-literacy-phonics-instruction.pdf|title=Meeting the challenges of early Literacy Phonics Instruction, International Literacy Association, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report clearly supports the use of phonics instruction that is explicit and systematic, stating that &quot;phonics instruction is helpful for all students, harmful for none, and crucial for some&quot;. It also offers an opinion on the ten most common causes of Phonics Instructional Failure, namely: inadequate time devoted to mastering a new phonics skill such as blending (4–6 weeks recommended); lack of application to real reading instruction; inappropriate reading material to practice the skills; too much teacher instruction, and too little reading by the student; lost time during instructional transitions; the teacher's attitude and knowledge of phonics instructional material; lessons that are not fast-paced and rigorous; lack of assessments over an extended period of time; waiting too long to transition to multi-syllable words; and over emphasis of phonics drills at the expense of other aspects such as vocabulary.

In 2019 the Best Evidence Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestevidence.org|title=Best Evidence Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of [[Johns Hopkins University]], release a review of research on 61 studies of 48 different programs for struggling readers in elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/strug_read_April_2019_full.pdf|title=A Quantitative Synthesis of Research on Programs for Struggling Readers in Elementary Schools, Best Evidence Encyclopedia, April 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority were done in the US, the programs are replicable, and the studies, done between 1990 and 2018, had a minimum duration of 12 weeks. Many of the programs used phonics-based teaching and/or one or more of the following: [[cooperative learning]], technology-supported adaptive instruction (see [[Educational technology]]), [[metacognitive]] skills, [[phonemic awareness]], word reading, [[fluency]], [[vocabulary]], [[multisensory learning]], [[spelling]], [[guided reading]], [[reading comprehension]], word analysis, structured [[curriculum]], and [[balanced literacy]] (non-phonetic approach). Significantly, table 5 (pg. 88) shows the mean weighted [[effect size]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/methodological_Sept_21_2015.pdf|title= How Methodological Features Affect Effect Sizes in Education, Best Evidence Encyclopedia, September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the programs by the manner in which they were conducted (i.e. by school, by classroom, by technology-supported adaptive instruction, by one-to-small-group tutoring, and by one-to-one tutoring). Table 8 (pg. 91) lists the 22 programs meeting [[Every Student Succeeds Act|ESSA]] standards for strong and moderate ratings, and their effect size. The review concludes that 1) outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring, 2) outcomes were positive but not as large for one-to-small group tutoring, 3) there were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors, 4) technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have positive outcomes, 5) whole-class approaches (mostly [[cooperative learning]]) and whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for one- to-one tutoring, and benefitted many more students, and 6) approaches mixing classroom and school improvements, with tutoring for the most [[at-risk students]], have the greatest potential for the largest numbers of struggling readers.

In 2019, 52.8% of Louisiana's third-graders scored at or above the State's reading benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/test-results/fall-2019-dibels-reading-report.pdf?sfvrsn=51c9a1f_2|title=Fall 2019 K-3 Reading Report, Louisiana Dept. of Ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2019, 26% of grade 4 students were reading at a proficiency level according to the Nation's Report Card.&lt;Ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile?chort=1&amp;sub=RED&amp;sj=AL&amp;sfj=NP&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2019R3|title=GRADE 4 READING 2019, Nation's Report Card}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] passed resolution 222 urging the Department of Education to create the ''Early Literacy Commission'' to make recommendations to implement a system providing effective [[Evidence-based education|evidence-based reading instruction]] for children from birth through third grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1142799|title=Louisiana HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 222, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/early-childhood/louisiana-s-early-literacy-commission-legislative-report.pdf?sfvrsn=984b9a1f_4|title=Louisiana Early Literacy Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2019, the [[Louisiana Department of Education]] revised their curriculum for K-12 English Language Arts. Its ''Reading Standards for Foundational Skills'' includes requirements for instruction in the alphabetic principle, phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, fluency and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/teacher-toolbox-resources/k-12-ela-standards.pdf|title=K-12 Student Standards for English Language Arts, Louisiana, 2019-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective in 2020 The [[Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (BESE) screens for the following skills: Kindergarten-Phonemic Awareness; First Grade-Phonics; Second Grade-Oral Reading Fluency; and Third Grade-Reading Comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/early-childhood/louisiana-s-early-literacy-commission-legislative-report.pdf?sfvrsn=984b9a1f_4|title=Louisiana's Early Literacy Commission, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, 30% of grade 4 students in [[Texas]] were reading at the &quot;proficiency level&quot; according to the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|Nation's Report Card]], as compared to the National Average of 34%.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile?chort=1&amp;sub=RED&amp;sj=AL&amp;sfj=NP&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2019R3|title=Grade 4 Reading, The Nation's Report Card (NAEP, 2019)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_221.40.asp|title= NAEP reading scale score of 4th-grade public school students, by state, 1992 through 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=147|title=Fast facts, NCES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June of that same year the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 3 (HB 3 Reading Academies) requiring all kindergarten through grade-three teachers and principals to &quot;''begin'' a teacher literacy achievement academy before the 2022-2023 school year&quot;. The training is anticipated to be a total of 80 hours.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://tcta.org/node/15296-tea_releases_new_details_on_literacy_achievement_academies|title=Literacy Achievement Academies, Texas Classroom Teachers Association, 2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to &quot;increase teacher knowledge and implementation of [[Evidence-based education|evidence-based practices]] to positively impact student literacy achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/tra_overviewparticipantdetails_final_1_2020.pdf|title=HB 3 Reading Academies, Texas Education Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required content of the academies' training includes the areas of ''Science of Teaching Reading, Oral Language, Phonological Awareness, Decoding (i.e. Phonics), Fluency and Comprehension.''

==Saddle==
[[File:Mochilla.jpg|thumb|upright|The Mochila: detail from Pony Express [[Pony Express#Route of the Pony Express|stations map]] by [[William Henry Jackson]]]]
In 1844, years before the Pony Express came to St. Joseph, Israel Landis opened a small saddle and harness shop there. His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town, Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}

The mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never used because of their size and shape, as  detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other was time-consuming, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes that were specially cut to size in the ''mochila''. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the ''mochila'' were four ''cantinas'', or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}

==Closing==
During its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered about 35,000 letters between St. Joseph and Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |access-date=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=17889&amp;img=1&amp;pg=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors, and Waddell did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern, congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called &quot;Stagecoach King&quot;, [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors, and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.

Shortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] reached Salt Lake City and connected [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and Sacramento.&lt;!--&lt;h Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.&lt;ref&gt;

Despite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure.  It grossed $90,000 and lost $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1866, after the Civil War was over, Holladay sold the Pony Express assets along with the remnants of the Butterfield Stage to [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]]&lt;!-- This link is properly to the &quot;History of Wells Fargo&quot; article as it relates to the express business of the original Wells, Fargo &amp; Company (founded 1852). All articles referencing &quot;Wells Fargo&quot; prior to 1998 (when Norwest Corporation acquired the successor to the original company's California banking business and assumed the Wells Fargo name) should link to the history article, except the armored-car business best described in the &quot;Loomis (company)&quot; article (Loomis is that business' successor); NO pre-1998 use of &quot;Wells Fargo&quot; should link to the bank article. --&gt; for $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.

==Commemorations==
In 1869, the United States Post Office issued the first U.S. postage stamp to depict an actual historic event, and the subject chosen was the Pony Express. Until then, only the faces of [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Andrew Jackson]] were found on the face of U.S. postage.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts United States Stamp Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the &quot;Pony Express Stamp&quot; issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960, commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express, respectively.

The [[National Pony Express Association]] is a nonprofit, volunteer-led historical organization. Its purpose is to preserve the original Pony Express trail and to continue the memory and importance of Pony Express in American history in partnership with the [[National Park Service]], [[Pony Express Trail Association]], and [[Oregon-California Trails Association]].

April 3, 2010 was the Pony Express' 150th anniversary. Located in St. Joseph, Missouri, the [[Patee House]] Museum, which was the Pony Express' headquarters, hosted events celebrating the anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjomissouri.net/uploadedFiles/Content/Things_To_Do/Sesquicentennial%20Events%201%2025%2010.pdf |title=Pony Express Sesquicentennial Banquet |publisher=St. Joseph, Missouri Travel and Tourism |access-date=February 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of accountable Pony Express history rests in the few tangible areas where records, papers, letters, and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s, most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay, and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders, and station keepers, or who were interested in stations or forts along the Pony Express route.

The most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' by Raymond and Mary Settle and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique, as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account, he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express among many historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service. Wells Fargo used the Pony Express logo for its guard and [[armored car (valuables)|armored-car]] services. The logo continued to be used when other companies took over the security business into the 1990s. Since 2001, the Pony Express logo is no longer used for security businesses, since the business has been sold.&lt;ref&gt;

The Pony Express route was designated the Pony Express [[National Historic Trail]] August 3, 1992, by an act of Congress. The public can auto-tour the route, visit interpretive sites and museums, and hike, bike, or horseback ride various trail segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/pony-express|title=Programs: National Conservation Lands: National Scenic and Historic Trails: Pony Express National Historic Trail|date=2016-10-06|website=www.blm.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The continued remembrance and popularity of the Pony Express can be linked to [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], his autobiographies, and his [[Wild West Show]]. The first book dedicated solely to the Pony Express was not published until 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot;&gt;

{{Great awakenings}}
{{Protestantism|expanded=Topics}}

The '''Great Awakening''' refers to a number of periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[History of Christianity in the United States|American Christian history]]. Historians and theologians identify three, or sometimes four, waves of increased religious enthusiasm between the early 18th century and the late 20th century. Each of these &quot;Great Awakenings&quot; was characterized by widespread revivals led by [[evangelical]] [[Protestant]] [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]], a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of [[new religious movement]]s and [[Christian denomination|denominations]].

The Awakenings all resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of personal guilt, their sin, and the need of salvation by Christ. Some of the influential people during the Great Awakening were [[George Whitefield]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], and [[Gilbert Tennent]], and some of the influential groups during the Great Awakening were the [[Old and New Light|New Lights and the Old Lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatawakeningdocumentary.com/exhibits/show/biographies/george-whitefield|title=The Great Awakening: Spiritual Revival in Colonial America {{!}} Biographies|website=greatawakeningdocumentary.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatawakeningdocumentary.com/exhibits/show/biographies/gilbert-tennent|title=The Great Awakening: Spiritual Revival in Colonial America {{!}} Biographies|website=greatawakeningdocumentary.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mb-soft.com/believe/txc/newlight.htm|title=New Light Schism|website=www.mb-soft.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction of personal sin and need for redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality. It brought Christianity to enslaved African-Americans and was an apocalyptic event in New England that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between old traditionalists who insisted on the continuing importance of ritual and doctrine, and the new revivalists, who encouraged emotional involvement and personal commitment. It had a major impact in reshaping the Congregational church, the Presbyterian church, the Dutch Reformed Church, and the German Reformed denomination, and strengthened the small Baptist and Methodist denominations. It had little impact on Anglicans and Quakers. Unlike the Second Great Awakening, which began about 1800 and reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972}}

== First Great Awakening ==
{{main|First Great Awakening}}
{{Historical Christian theology}}

The [[First Great Awakening]] began in the 1730s and lasted to about 1740, though pockets of revivalism had occurred in years prior, especially amongst the ministry of [[Solomon Stoddard]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' grandfather.{{sfn|Curtis|1991|p=135}} Edwards' congregation was involved in a revival later called the &quot;Frontier Revivals&quot; in the mid-1730s, though this was on the wane by 1737.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=283}} But as American religious historian [[Sydney E. Ahlstrom]] noted, the Great Awakening &quot;was still to come, ushered in by the Grand Itinerant&quot;,{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=283}} the British evangelist [[George Whitefield]]. Whitefield arrived in Georgia in 1738, and returned in 1739 for a second visit of the Colonies, making a &quot;triumphant campaign north from Philadelphia to New York, and back to the South&quot;.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=283}} In 1740, he visited New England, and &quot;at every place he visited, the consequences were large and tumultuous&quot;. Ministers from various evangelical Protestant denominations supported the Great Awakening.{{sfn|Kidd|2007}} In the middle colonies, he influenced not only the British churches, but the Dutch and Germans
Additionally, pastoral styles began to change. In the late colonial period, most pastors read their sermons, which were theologically dense and advanced a particular theological argument or interpretation. [[Nathan O. Hatch]] argues that the evangelical movement of the 1740s played a key role in the development of democratic thought,{{sfn|Hatch|1989}}{{Disputed inline|date=October 2015}} as well as the belief of the free press and the belief that information should be shared and completely unbiased and uncontrolled.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|p=173}} Michał Choiński argues that the First Great Awakening marks the birth of the American &quot;rhetoric of the revival&quot; understood as &quot;a particular mode of preaching in which the speaker employs and it has a really wide array of patterns and communicative strategies to initiate religious conversions and spiritual regeneration among the hearers&quot;.{{sfn|Choiński|2016|p=51}} All these theological, social, and rhetorical notions ushered in the period of the American Revolution. This contributed to create a demand for religious freedom.{{sfn|Corbett|Corbett-Hemeyer|Wilson|2014|pp=37–38}} The Great Awakening represented the first time African Americans embraced Christianity in large numbers.{{sfn|Chacon|Scoggins|2014|pp=36–37}}

In the later part of the 1700s the Revival came to the English colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], primarily through the efforts of [[Henry Alline]] and his New Light movement.{{sfn|Stewart|1982}}

==Second Great Awakening==
{{Main|Second Great Awakening}}

The Second Great Awakening (sometimes known simply as &quot;the Great Awakening&quot;) was a religious revival that occurred in the United States beginning in the late eighteenth century and lasting until the middle of the nineteenth century. While it occurred in all parts of the United States, it was especially strong in the Northeast and the Midwest.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|pp=415–454}} This awakening was unique in that it moved beyond the educated elite of New England to those who were less wealthy and less educated. The center of revivalism was the so-called [[Burned-over district]] in western New York. Named for its overabundance of hellfire-and-damnation preaching, the region produced dozens of new denominations, communal societies, and reform.{{sfn|Cross|1950}}

Among these dozens of new denominations were free black churches, run independently of existing congregations that were predominately of white attendance. During the period between the American revolution and the 1850s, black involvement in largely white churches declined in great numbers, with participation becoming almost non-existent by the 1840s–1850s; some scholars argue that this was largely due to racial discrimination within the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boles&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Documents relating to African American experiences of white congregational churches in Massachusetts, 1773–1832 |first=Richard J. |last=Boles |journal=The New England Quarterly |volume=86 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=310–323 |jstor=43284993 |doi=10.1162/TNEQ_a_00280}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination came in the form of segregated seating and the forbiddance of African Americans from voting in church matters or holding leadership positions in many white churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boles&quot; /&gt; Reverend Richard Allen, a central founder of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], was quoted describing one such incident of racial discrimination in a predominately white church in Philadelphia, in which fellow preacher and a former slave from Delaware [[Absalom Jones]] was forcefully told to leave and grabbed by a white church trustee in the midst of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/lcrbmrp.t1608/?sp=6|title=Image 6 of The Episcopal Church and the colored people : a statement of facts|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2018-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to the Second Great Awakening were other reform movements such as [[American Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]], and [[First-wave feminism|women's rights]].  The temperance movement encouraged people to abstain from consuming alcoholic drinks in order to preserve family order. The abolition movement fought to abolish slavery in the United States. The women's rights movement grew from female abolitionists who realized that they too could fight for their own political rights. In addition to these causes, reforms touched nearly every aspect of daily life, such as restricting the use of tobacco and dietary and dress reforms. The abolition movement emerged in the North from the wider Second Great Awakening 1800–1840.{{sfn|McLoughlin|1978}}

==Third Great Awakening==
{{main|Third Great Awakening}}

The [[Third Great Awakening]] in the 1850s–1900s was characterized by new denominations, active missionary work, [[Chautauqua#Religious expression|Chautauquas]], and the [[Social Gospel]] approach to social issues.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972}} The [[YMCA]] (founded in 1844) played a major role in fostering revivals in the cities in the 1858 Awakening and after. The revival of 1858 produced the leadership, such as that of [[Dwight L. Moody]], out of which came religious work carried on in the armies during the civil war. The [[United States Christian Commission|Christian]] and [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary]] Commissions and numerous [[Freedmen's Aid Society|Freedmen's Societies]] were also formed in the midst of the War.{{sfn|Long|1998}}

==Fourth Great Awakening==
{{main|Fourth Great Awakening}}

The Fourth Great Awakening is a debated concept that has not received the acceptance of the first three. Advocates such as economist [[Robert Fogel]] say it happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Fogel|2000|p=10}} The [[Jesus Movement]] is one evidence of this awakening, and it created a shift in church music styles.

Mainline Protestant denominations weakened sharply in both membership and influence while the most conservative religious denominations (such as the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]] and [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod Lutherans]]) grew rapidly in numbers, spread across the United States, had grave internal theological battles and schisms, and became politically powerful.{{sfn|Marty|1996|pp=434–455}}

==Terminology==
The idea of an &quot;awakening&quot; implies a slumber or passivity during secular or less religious times. Awakening is a term which originates from and is embraced often and primarily by evangelical Christians.{{sfn|Lambert|1999}} In recent times, the idea of &quot;awakenings&quot; in United States history has been put forth by conservative American evangelicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Baker (author) |date=September 13, 2006 |title=Bush Tells Group He Sees a 'Third Awakening' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/12/AR2006091201594.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Great awakenings}}
The '''Second Great Awakening''' was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] religious [[Christian revival|revival]] during the early 19th century in the United States. The Second Great Awakening, which spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching, sparked a number of reform movements. Revivals were a key part of the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new Protestant denominations. The Methodist Church used [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] to reach people in frontier locations. The Second Great Awakening led to a period of antebellum social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions. The outpouring of religious fervor and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists. The awakening brought comfort in the face of uncertainty as a result of the socio-political changes in America.

It led to the founding of several well known colleges, seminaries and mission societies. The Great Awakening notably altered the religious climate in the American colonies. Ordinary people were encouraged to make a personal connection with God, instead of relying on a minister. Newer denominations, such as Methodists and Baptists, grew quickly. While the movement unified the colonies and boosted church growth, experts say it also caused division among those who supported it and those who rejected it.

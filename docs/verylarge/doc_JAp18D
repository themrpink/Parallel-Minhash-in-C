In the next stage of the war, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in [[Silesia]] and [[Pomerania]], with the assistance of Dutch and Italian soldiers in the latter case. Napoleon then turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at [[Königsberg]]. A tactical draw at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] (7–8 February 1807), followed by capitulation at [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Danzig]] (24 May 1807) and the [[Battle of Heilsberg]] (10 June 1807), forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon decisively beat the Russian army at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (14 June 1807), following which Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at [[Treaty of Tilsit|Tilsit]] (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland, new Napoleonic client states, such as the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Republic of Danzig]], were established.

By September, [[Guillaume Brune|Marshal Guillaume Brune]] completed the occupation of [[Swedish Pomerania]], allowing the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.

Britain's first response to Napoleon's Continental System was to launch a major naval attack against Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In August 1807, the Royal Navy [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|besieged and bombarded Copenhagen]], leading to the capture of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]], and assuring use of the sea lanes in the North and Baltic seas for the British merchant fleet.

Denmark also committed themselves to participate in a war against Sweden together with France and Russia.

At Tilsit, Napoleon and Alexander had agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to a [[Finnish War|Russian invasion of Finland]] in February 1808, followed by a [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-09|Danish declaration of war]] in March. Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], led by Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the [[Øresund]] strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] (September–October 1808), France and Russia further agreed on the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], where the eastern part became the Russian [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. British voluntary attempts to assist Sweden with humanitarian aid remained limited and did not prevent Sweden from adopting a more Napoleon-friendly policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Götz|first=Norbert|date=2014-06-06|title=The Good Plumpuddings' Belief: British Voluntary Aid to Sweden During the Napoleonic Wars|journal=The International History Review|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=519–539|doi=10.1080/07075332.2014.918559|issn=0707-5332|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war between Denmark and Britain effectively ended with a British victory at the [[battle of Lyngør]] in 1812, involving the destruction of the last large Dano-Norwegian ship—the [[frigate]] ''[[HDMS Najaden (1811)|Najaden]]''.

===Poland===
{{main|Duchy of Warsaw}}
[[File:January Suchodolski, Bitwa pod Somosierrą.jpg|thumb|[[Polish cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Somosierra]] in Spain, 1808]]

In 1807 Napoleon created a powerful outpost of his empire in Central Europe. [[History of Poland|Poland]] had recently been partitioned by its three large neighbours, but Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, which depended on France from the very beginning. The duchy consisted of lands seized by Austria and Prussia; its Grand Duke was Napoleon's ally the king of Saxony, but Napoleon appointed the intendants who ran the country. The population of 4.3&amp;nbsp;million was released from occupation and by 1814 sent about 200,000 men to Napoleon's armies. That included about 90,000 who marched with him to Moscow; few marched back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Pivka|title=Napoleon's Polish Troops|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETYsTuIaKkQC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=8–10|isbn=9781780965499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians strongly opposed any move towards an independent Poland and one reason Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 was to punish them. The Grand Duchy was dissolved in 1815 and Poland did not become a state until 1918 (and only then because of the Bolshevik Revolution). Napoleon's impact on Poland was huge, including the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Riley, ''Napoleon and the World War of 1813: Lessons in Coalition Warfighting'' (2000) pp&amp;nbsp;27–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp&amp;nbsp;176–87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peninsular War, 1808-14==
{{Main|Peninsular War}}
[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 décembre 1808.jpg|thumb|Napoleon accepting the surrender of Madrid during the Peninsular War]]
The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied [[Madrid]], and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|popular rebellions]] across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.
[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Second of May 1808|The Second of May 1808: The Charge of the Mamelukes]]'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814)]]

After defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula ([[Battle of Corunna]], 16 January 1809). But when he left, the [[guerrilla war]] against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. The outbreak of the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars (3): The Peninsular War 1807–1814'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, the British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnable [[lines of Torres Vedras]]), while their Spanish allies were [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged in Cadiz]]. 

The Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well when he was in direct charge, but severe losses followed his departure, as he severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. The effort in Spain was a drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the &quot;Spanish ulcer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Gates, ''The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, &quot;That unfortunate war destroyed me ... All the circumstances of my disasters are bound up in that fatal knot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Lawrence Tone, &quot;Partisan Warfare in Spain and Total War,&quot; in {{cite book|author=Roger Chickering and Stig Förster, eds.|title=War in an Age of Revolution, 1775–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2WtMq4LF90C&amp;pg=PA243|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=243|isbn=9780521899963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaigns]] witnessed 60 major battles and 30 major sieges, more than any other of the Napoleonic conflicts, and lasted over six years, far longer than any of the others. France and her allies lost at least 91,000 killed in action and 237,000 wounded in the peninsula.&lt;ref name=clodfelter&gt;{{cite book|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492–2015|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1812, the Peninsular War merged with the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].

==War of the Fifth Coalition 1809==
{{Main|War of the Fifth Coalition}}
The Fifth Coalition (1809) of Britain and Austria against France formed as Britain engaged in the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain and Portugal. The sea became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] against Napoleon's allies. Austria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles included [[Battle of Raszyn]], [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]], and [[Battle of Wagram]].

On land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the [[Walcheren Expedition]] of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham]], failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled [[Antwerp]]. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.

[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The French Empire in 1812 at its greatest extent]]
Austria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]]. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).

In the east, the Austrians drove into the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] but suffered defeat at the [[Battle of Raszyn]] on 19 April 1809. The Polish army captured [[West Galicia]] following its earlier success. Napoleon assumed personal command and bolstered the army for a counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the [[Danube]] resulted in the major [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] (22 May 1809) — Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], on 5–6 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Marshal Bernadotte]] was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)

The War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] (14 October 1809). In the east, only the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]ese rebels led by [[Andreas Hofer]] continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809. In the west the Peninsular War continued. Economic warfare between Britain and France continued: The British continuied a naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred and the French [[Continental System]] was largely ineffective and did little economic damage to Great Britain. Both sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His rise and fall '' (1951) pp 235–40&lt;/ref&gt; ; the British fought the United States in the [[War of 1812]] (1812–15). 

In 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. Napoleon married [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]], an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:
* the [[Denmark-Norway|Kingdom of Denmark]] 
* the [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Spain]] (under [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's elder brother)
* the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] ([[Jérôme Bonaparte]], Napoleon's younger brother)
* the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples|Kingdom of Naples]] (under [[Joachim Murat]], husband of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte|Caroline]])
* the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] (under [[Elisa Bonaparte]] (Napoleon's sister) and her husband [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice Baciocchi]]);
and Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, Prussia and Austria.

==Subsidiary wars==
The Napoleonic Wars were the direct cause of wars in the Americas and elsewhere.

===War of 1812===
{{Main|War of 1812}}
The [[War of 1812]] coincided with the War of the Sixth Coalition. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, while Europeans often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The United States declared war on Britain because of British interference with American merchant ships and [[Impressment#Conflict with the United States|forced enlistment]] into the British Royal Navy. France had interfered as well, and the US considered declaring war on France. The war ended in a military stalemate, and there were no boundary changes at the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in early 1815 when Napoleon was on Elba.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin American Revolutions===
{{main|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil|Haitian Revolution}}
[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|200px|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]
The abdication of kings [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] and [[Ferdinand VII|Fernando VII]] of Spain and the installation of Napoleon's brother as [[Joseph Bonaparte|King José]] provoked civil wars and revolutions leading to the independence of most of Spain's mainland American colonies. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]],  ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800–1850''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, pp. 402–403.&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815 caused an exodus of French soldiers into Latin America where they joined ranks with the armies of the independence movements.&lt;ref name=OreBerg18&gt;{{Cite journal|title=BERGUÑO HURTADO, Fernando. Los soldados de Napoleón en la Independencia de Chile. 1817– 1830|journal=[[Revista de historia americana y argentina]]|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2314-15492018000100011|last=Orellana Billiard|first=Jorge Andrés|volume=53|issue=1|year=2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these officials had a role in various victories such as the [[Capture of Valdivia]] (1820) some are held responsible for significant defeats at the hands of the royalist as is the case of [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada]] (1818).&lt;ref name=OreBerg18/&gt;

In contrast, the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|royal family]] escaped to [[Brazil]] and established the court there, resulting in political stability for Portuguese America. With the defeat of Napoleon and the return of the Braganza monarchy to Portugal, the heir remained in Brazil and declared Brazilian independence, achieving it peacefully with the territory intact.

The [[Haitian Revolution]] began in 1791, just before the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and continued until 1804. France's defeat resulted in the independence of [[Saint-Domingue]] and led Napoleon to sell the territory making up the [[Louisiana Purchase]] to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;For Alexander Hamilton's take on the connection of Saint-Domingue and the Purchase, see &quot;Hamilton on the Louisiana Purchase: A Newly Identified Editorial from the ''New-York Evening Post''&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 12/2 (Apr. 1955): 268–281.

[[File:Battle of Borodino 1812.png|thumb|The [[Battle of Borodino]] as depicted by [[Louis-François, Baron Lejeune|Louis Lejeune]]. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars.]]

The [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807 resulted in the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812)|Anglo-Russian War]] (1807–12). Emperor Alexander I declared war on Britain after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the [[Finnish War]] and won victories over the Russians in the [[Gulf of Finland]] in July 1808 and August 1809. The success of the Russian army on land, however, forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810, and to join the blockade against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Palmer, ''Alexander I: Tsar of War and Peace'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The central issue for both Napoleon and Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] was control over Poland. Each wanted a semi-independent Poland he could control. As Esdaile notes, &quot;Implicit in the idea of a Russian Poland was, of course, a war against Napoleon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Esdaile, ''Napoleon's Wars: An International History, 1803–1815'' (2007) p 438&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder says Poland was &quot;the root cause&quot; of Napoleon's war with Russia but Russia's refusal to support the Continental System was also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics: 1763 – 1848'' (1994) p 419&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European [[La Grande Armée|''Grande Armée'']], consisting of 450,000 men (200,000 Frenchmen, and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). The French forces crossed the [[Niemen River]] on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]], and Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Richard =K. |last=Riehn |title=1812: Napoleon's Russian campaign |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Grande Armée'' marched through Russia, winning some relatively minor engagements and the major [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]] on 16–18 August. In the same days, part of the French Army led by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Nicolas Oudinot]] was stopped in the [[First Battle of Polotsk|Battle of Polotsk]] by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General [[Peter Wittgenstein]]. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]]; the fate of the invasion was decided in Moscow, where Napoleon led his forces in person.

[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Napoleon]]'s withdrawal from Russia'', a painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]

Russia used [[scorched-earth]] tactics, and harried the ''Grande Armée'' with light [[Cossack]] cavalry. The ''Grande Armée'' did not adjust its operational methods in response.&lt;ref&gt;Riehn 1990, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to most of the losses of the main column of the ''Grande Armée'', which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a week.&lt;ref&gt;Reihn 1990, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of [[Field Marshal]] [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]] and a veteran, Prince [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], was made the new Commander-in-Chief by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Finally, the two armies engaged in the [[Battle of Borodino]] on 7 September,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Haythornthwaite, ''Borodino 1812; Napoleon's great gamble'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. It was indecisive; the French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. Logistical difficulties meant that French casualties could not be replaced, unlike Russian ones.

Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army had retreated yet again.&lt;ref&gt;Reihn, ''1812,''  pp. 253–254&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; the governor, Count [[Fyodor Rostopchin]], ordered the city [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|to be burnt]].&lt;ref&gt;''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109–107 Pub. William Morrow and Co 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander I refused to capitulate, and the peace talks attempted by Napoleon failed. In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.

[[File:Minard's Map (vectorized).svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s graph of the decreasing size of the Grande Armée represented by the width of the line as it marches to Moscow (tan) and back (black)]]

At the [[Battle of Maloyaroslavets]] the French tried to reach [[Kaluga]], where they could find food and forage supplies. The replenished Russian Army blocked the road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow, through the heavily ravaged areas along the [[Smolensk]] road. In the following weeks, the ''Grande Armée'' was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the [[Russian Winter]], the lack of supplies and constant [[guerrilla warfare]] by Russian peasants and irregular troops.

When the remnants of the Napoleon's army [[Battle of Berezina|crossed the Berezina River]] in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers survived, with 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wordsworth Pocket Encyclopedia,'' page 17, Hertfordshire 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians. The campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies.

Seeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and several other German states switched sides joining Russia, the United Kingdom and others opposing Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp 431–74&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] (2 May 1813) and [[Battle of Bautzen (1813)|Bautzen]] (20–21 May 1813). Both battles involved forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far. Metternich in November 1813 offered Napoleon the [[Frankfurt proposals]]. They would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but France would be reduced to its &quot;natural frontiers&quot; and lose control of most of Italy and Germany and the Netherlands. Napoleon still expected to win the wars, and rejected the terms. By 1814, as the Allies were closing in on Paris, Napoleon did agree to the Frankfurt proposals, but it was too late and he rejected the new harsher terms proposed by the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

In the [[Peninsular War]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], renewed the [[Anglo-Portuguese Army|Anglo-Portuguese]] advance into Spain just after New Year in 1812, besieging and capturing the fortified towns of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]], [[Badajoz]], and in the [[Battle of Salamanca]] (which was a damaging defeat of the French). As the French regrouped, the Anglo-Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of [[Andalusia]] and [[Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Young and James Philip Lawford, ''Wellington's masterpiece: the battle and campaign of Salamanca'' (outledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. The Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at [[Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria]], the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against [[Joseph Bonaparte]], finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat from the Iberian peninsula, over the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Glover, ''Wellington's Peninsular Victories: Busaco, Salamanca, Vitoria, Nivelle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

The belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million men in the preceding two months. During this time coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding 300,000 men to the coalition armies in Germany. The Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the front-line operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

Napoleon succeeded in bringing the imperial forces in the region to around 650,000—although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]] and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]]'s Kingdom of Italy had 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo-Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany—which left him outnumbered about four to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

Following the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]] (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. The failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in Saxony (16–19 October 1813), also called the &quot;Battle of the Nations&quot;, 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. After the French withdrawal from Germany, Napoleon's remaining ally, [[Denmark-Norway]], became isolated and [[Treaty of Kiel|fell to the coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hofschroer, ''Leipzig 1813: The Battle of the Nations'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon then fought a series of battles in France, including the [[Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube]], but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. The Allies [[Battle of Paris (1814)|entered Paris]] on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his [[Six Days' Campaign]], in which he won many battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. During this entire campaign he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million coalition soldiers. At the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98&quot;&gt;Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon In Power'' (2013) pp 464–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his fall from power. During the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these materialised, and Napoleon's schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of his hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland in early 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98&quot;/&gt;

The victors exiled Napoleon to the island of [[Elba]], and restored the French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the person of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. They signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (11 April 1814) and initiated the [[Congress of Vienna]] to redraw the map of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Dwyer 2013 pp 464-98&quot;/&gt;

The [[Seventh Coalition]] (1815) pitted Britain, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and several smaller German states against France. The period known as the [[Hundred Days]] began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at [[Cannes]] (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew the restored [[Louis XVIII]]. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5&amp;nbsp;million new men into the French army, which was never achieved. This faced an initial coalition force of about 700,000—although coalition campaign plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel.

Napoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hofschroer, ''The Waterloo Campaign: Wellington, His German Allies and the Battles of Ligny and Quatre Bras'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to attack the coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating 75% of their army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the [[Armée du Nord]] to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]] on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in disorder. On the same day, the left wing of the Armée du Nord, under the command of Marshal [[Michel Ney]], succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Blücher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]]. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an [[escarpment]] at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].

Napoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realise that the Prussian forces were already reorganised and were assembling at the village of Wavre. The French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards Waterloo the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen [[Johann von Thielmann|von Thielmann]] in the [[Battle of Wavre]] (18–19 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.

===Le Mourillon===
{{Main|Le Mourillon}}
Le Mourillon is a small seaside neighbourhood to the east of Toulon, near the entrance of the harbour. It was once a fishing village, and then became the home of many of the officers of the French fleet. Mourillon has a small fishing port, next to a 16th-century fort, Fort Saint Louis, which was reconstructed by Vauban.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Vergé-Franceschi, ''Toulon – Port Royal (1481–1789''. Tallandier: Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the city of Toulon built a series of sheltered sandy beaches in Mourillon, which today are very popular with the Toulonais and naval families. The Museum of Asian Art is in a house on the waterfront near Fort St. Louis.

===Mount Faron===
{{Main|Mont Faron}}
Mount Faron ({{convert|584|m|ft|abbr=off}}) dominates the city of Toulon. The top can be reached by cable car from Toulon or by a narrow, terrifying road that ascends from the west side and descends on the east side. The road is one of the most challenging stages of the annual [[Paris–Nice]] and [[Tour Méditerranéen]] bicycle races.

At the top of Mount Faron is a memorial dedicated to the 1944 Allied landings in Provence ([[Operation Dragoon]]), and to the liberation of Toulon.

===Vauban's fortifications===
[[File:Wikipedia-porte-italie.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|left|The Porte d'Italie, built by Vauban. Napoleon departed from this gate in 1796 on his Italian campaign.]]
Beginning in 1678, [[Vauban]] constructed an elaborate system of fortifications around Toulon. Some parts, such as the section that once ran along the present-day Boulevard de Strasbourg, were removed in the mid-19th century so the city could be enlarged, but other parts remain.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Vergé-Franceschi, ''Toulon – Port Royal (1481–1789).'' Tallandier: Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; One part that can be visited is the Porte d'Italie, one of the old city gates. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] departed on his triumphant Italian campaign from this gate in 1796.

==Climate==
[[File:Toulon Rade Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Harbour at Sunset]]
Toulon has a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Koppen: Csa), characterised by abundant and strong sunshine, dry summers, and rain which is rare but sometimes torrential; and by hot summers and mild winters. Because of its proximity to the sea, the temperature is relatively moderate.

The average temperature in January, the coldest month, is {{convert|9.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}, the warmest of any city in metropolitan France. In January the maximum average temperature is {{convert|12.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. and the average minimum temperature is {{convert|5.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

The average temperature in July, the warmest month, is {{convert|23.9|°C|0|abbr=on}}., with an average maximum of {{convert|29.1|°C|0|abbr=on}}. and an average minimal temperature of {{convert|18.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

According to data collected by [[Météo-France]], Toulon is the city in metropolitan France with the most sunshine per year: an average of 2,856 hours a year from 1999 to 2008, compared with 2,695 hours a year for Nice and 2,472 hours for Perpignan.&lt;ref&gt;Lameteo.org comparative climate statistics for cities of France.  See also: http://climat.meteofrance.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527204441/http://climat.meteofrance.com/ |date=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the wall of mountains that largely protects Toulon from the weather coming from north. With an yearly average temperature of {{convert|16.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}, it is also one of the warmest cities in metropolitan France.

Average rainfall is 665 millimetres per year. The driest month is July with {{convert|6.6|mm|2|abbr=on}}, and the wettest is October, with {{convert|93.9|mm|2|abbr=on}}. It rains on less than 60 days per year (an average of 59.7 days) and the amount of precipitation is very unequal in the different seasons. In February, the month with the most rain, it rains 7.1 days, but with only {{convert|88.3|mm|2|abbr=off}} of rain, while in October there are 5.9 days of rain. July, with 1.3 days of rain, is usually the driest month, but the driest month can fall anywhere between May and September. Autumn is characterized by torrential but brief rains; in winter there is more precipitation, spread out over longer periods.

Because of the proximity to the sea, freezing temperatures are rare; an average of 2.9 days a year, and lasting frosts (when the maximum temperature remains less or equal to zero) are non-existent. Snow is also very rare (barely 1.5 days per year on average) and it is even more rare for the snow to last during the day (0.3 days a year on average).

One distinctive feature of the Toulon climate is the wind, with 115 days a year of strong winds; usually either the cold and dry [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]] or the [[Tramontane]] from the north, the wet [[Marin (wind)|Marin]]; or the [[Sirocco]] sometimes bearing reddish sand from Africa; or the wet and stormy [[Levant]] from the east. (See [[Winds of Provence]].) The windiest month is January, with an average of 12.5 days of strong winds. The least windy month is September, with 7 days of strong winds. In winter, the Mistral can make the air feel extremely cold, even though the temperature is mild.

The climate is dry and the humidity in Toulon is usually low. The average humidity is 56 percent, with little variation throughout the year; the driest months are July and August with 50 percent, and the most humid months are November and December with 60 percent.

==Museums==
Toulon has a number of museums.

The '''Museum of the French Navy''' (Musée national de la marine) is located on Place Monsenergue, next on the west side of the old port, a short distance from the Hotel de Ville. The museum was founded in 1814, during the reign of the Emperor Napoleon. It is located today behind what was formerly the monumental gate to the Arsenal of Toulon, built in 1738. The museum building, along with the clock tower next to it, is one of the few buildings of the port and arsenal which survived Allied bombardments during World War II. It contains displays tracing the history of Toulon as a port of the [[French Navy]]. Highlights include large 18th-century ship models used to teach seamanship and models of the aircraft carrier ''[[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|Charles De Gaulle]]''.

The '''Museum of Old Toulon and its Region''' (Musée du vieux Toulon et de sa région). The Museum was founded in 1912, and contains a collection of maps, paintings, drawings, models and other artifacts showing the history of the city.

The '''Museum of Asian Arts''' (Musée des arts asiatiques), in Mourillon. Located in a house with garden which once belonged to the son and later the grandson of author [[Jules Verne]], the museum contains a small but interesting collection of art objects, many donated by naval officers from the time of the French colonization of Southeast Asia. It includes objects and paintings from India, China, Southeast Asia, Tibet and Japan.

The '''Museum of Art''' (Musée d'art) was created in 1888, and contains collections of modern and contemporary art, as well as paintings of Provence from the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century. It owns works by landscape artists of Provence from the late 19th century ([[Paul Guigou]], [[Auguste Aiguier]], [[Vincent Courdouan]], [[Félix Ziem]]), and the Fauves of Provence ([[Charles Camoin]], [[Auguste Chabaud]], [[Louis Mathieu Verdilhan]]). The contemporary collections contain works from 1960 to today representing the New Realism Movement (Arman, César, [[Christo]], Klein, Raysse); Minimalist Art ([[Sol LeWitt]], [[Donald Judd]]); Support Surface (Cane, Viallat côtoient Arnal, Buren, Chacallis) and an important collection of photographs by [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[Dieuzaide]], [[Edouard Boubat]], [[Willy Ronis]] and [[André Kertész]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.var.fr/dispatch.do?sectionId=site/page_d_accueil_10772717277503/culture_10772718348439/mus_es_du_var_115338388885021/provence_m_diterran_e_115338435173725/toulon_1153919362639113&amp;publicationId=art_1154005578556135 See the page about the Museum on the official site of the Museums of the Var] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205144402/http://www.var.fr/dispatch.do?sectionId=site%2Fpage_d_accueil_10772717277503%2Fculture_10772718348439%2Fmus_es_du_var_115338388885021%2Fprovence_m_diterran_e_115338435173725%2Ftoulon_1153919362639113&amp;publicationId=art_1154005578556135 |date=5 December 2008 }} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Memorial Museum to the Landings in Provence''' (Mémorial du débarquement de Provence) is located on the summit of Mount Faron, this small museum, opened in 1964 by President [[Charles De Gaulle]], commemorates the Allied landing in Provence in August 1944 with photos, weapons and models.

The '''Museum of Natural History of Toulon and the Var''' (Musée d'histoire naturelle de Toulon et du Var) was founded in 1888, has a large collection of displays about dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and minerals, mostly from the region.

The '''Hôtel des arts''' was opened in 1998, presents five exhibits a year of works by well-known contemporary artists. Featured artists have included [[Sean Scully]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Claude Viallat]], [[Per Kirkeby]], and [[Vik Muniz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toulon.com/musee/art/tabid/216/RemoteModuleID/690/Default.aspx#1794 See the site of the Museums of Toulon on the Toulon City Web Site (in French)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210001205/http://www.toulon.com/musee/art/tabid/216/RemoteModuleID/690/Default.aspx#1794 |date=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Toulon has a [[Music school|conservatory]] ([[Conservatoire TPM]], part of [[Conservatoire à rayonnement régional de Toulon]]) which taught music, theater, dance and circus and an [[art school|art academy]] called [[École supérieure d'art et de design Toulon Provence Méditerranée]]. Toulon is also home to a number of institutes of the [[University of the South, Toulon-Var|University of Toulon]], known until 2013 as University of the South, Toulon-Var. Toulon has a campus of [[KEDGE Business School]].

==Literature==
Toulon figures prominently in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]''. It is the location of the infamous prison, the [[bagne of Toulon]], in which the protagonist Jean Valjean spends nineteen years in hard labour. Toulon is also the birthplace of the novel's antagonist, [[Javert]].

One portion of the wall of the old bagne, or prison, where Jean Valjean was supposedly held still stands to the right of the entrance of the Old Harbour. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In [[Anthony Powell]]'s novel ''[[What's Become of Waring]]'' the central characters spend a long summer holiday in Toulon's old town. Powell himself stayed at the Hotel du Port et des Negociants on two occasions in the early 1930s and writes in the second volume of his memoirs ''The naval port, with its small inner harbour, row of cafés along the rade, was quite separate from the business quarter of the town. A paddle steamer plied several times a day between this roadstead and the agreeably unsophisticated plage of Les Sablettes''.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s last novel, ''''[[The Rover (novel)|The Rover]]'''', is also set around Toulon.

The last half of [[Dewey Lambdin]]'s historical fiction novel, ''H.M.S. Cockerel'', (the sixth novel in his [[Alan Lewrie]] naval adventure series) details the [[Siege of Toulon]] from Lewrie's perspective, as he commands a commandeered French barge carrying sea mortars against Lieutenant-Colonel Bonaparte's forces.

==Transport==
[[file:2016 Toulon - Hafen.jpg|thumb|Harbor with ferry]]
Toulon is served by the [[Gare de Toulon]] railway station, offering suburban services to Marseille (1 train every 15minutes during rush hour), Nice, Paris and regional destinations. The port of Toulon is the main port of departure for ferries to [[Corsica]]. The nearest airport is the regional [[Toulon-Hyères Airport]]. The [[A50 autoroute]] connects Toulon to Marseille, the [[A57 autoroute]] runs from Toulon to Le Luc, where it connects to the [[A8 autoroute]].

The '''Battle of Bannockburn''' ({{lang-gd|Blàr Allt nam Bànag}} or {{lang|gd|Blàr Allt a' Bhonnaich}}) on 23 and 24 June 1314 was a victory of the army of King of Scots [[Robert the Bruce]] over the army of King [[Edward II of England]] in the [[First War of Scottish Independence]]. Although it did not bring an end to the war, as victory would only be secured 14 years later, Bannockburn is still a landmark in Scottish history.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC – Scotland's History – The Battle of Bannockburn |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/battle_of_bannockburn/ |accessdate=2 December 2018 |work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Edward II invaded Scotland after Bruce demanded in 1313 that all supporters still loyal to ousted Scottish king [[John Balliol]] acknowledge Bruce as their king or lose their lands. [[Stirling Castle]], a Scots royal fortress occupied by the English, was under siege by the Scottish army. King Edward assembled a formidable force of soldiers from England, Ireland and Wales to relieve it – the largest army ever to invade Scotland. This attempt failed when he found his path blocked by a smaller army commanded by Bruce.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

The Scottish army was divided into three divisions of [[schiltron]]s commanded by Bruce, his brother [[Edward Bruce]], and his nephew, the [[Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]]. After Robert Bruce killed Sir [[Henry de Bohun]] on the first day of the battle, the English were forced to withdraw for the night. Sir [[Alexander Seton (Governor of Berwick)|Alexander Seton]], a Scottish noble serving in Edward's army, defected to the Scottish side and informed them of the English camp's position and low morale. Robert Bruce decided to launch a full-scale attack on the English forces and to use his schiltrons again as offensive units, a strategy his predecessor [[William Wallace]] had not used. The English army was defeated in a [[pitched battle]] which resulted in the deaths of several prominent commanders, including the [[Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester|Earl of Gloucester]] and Sir [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]], and capture of many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

The victory against the English at [[Bannockburn]] is the most celebrated in Scottish history, and for centuries the battle has been commemorated in verse and art. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] operates the Bannockburn Visitor Centre (previously known as the Bannockburn Heritage Centre). Though the exact location for the battle is uncertain, a modern monument was erected in a field above a possible site of the battlefield, where the warring parties are believed to have camped, alongside a statue of Robert Bruce designed by [[Pilkington Jackson]]. The monument, along with the associated visitor centre, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area.

In [[Fourier-transform mass spectrometry]], the energizing event is the injection of the charged sample into the strong electromagnetic field of a cyclotron.  These particles travel in circles, inducing a current in a fixed coil on one point in their circle.  Each traveling particle exhibits a characteristic cyclotron frequency-field ratio revealing the masses in the sample.

===Free induction decay===
Pulsed FT spectrometry gives the advantage of requiring a single, time-dependent measurement which can easily deconvolute a set of similar but distinct signals.  The resulting composite signal, is called a ''free induction decay,'' because typically the signal will decay due to inhomogeneities in sample frequency, or simply unrecoverable loss of signal due to entropic loss of the property being measured.

=== Nanoscale spectroscopy with pulsed sources ===
Pulsed sources allow for the utilization of Fourier-transform spectroscopy principles in [[Near-field scanning optical microscope|scanning near-field optical microscopy]] techniques. Particularly in [[nano-FTIR]], where the scattering from a sharp probe-tip is used to perform spectroscopy of samples with nanoscale spatial resolution, a high-power illumination from pulsed infrared lasers makes up for a relatively small [[Scattering cross section|scattering efficiency]] (often &lt; 1%) of the probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hegenbarth|first1=R|last2=Steinmann|first2=A|last3=Mastel|first3=S|last4=Amarie|first4=S|last5=Huber|first5=A J|last6=Hillenbrand|first6=R|last7=Sarkisov|first7=S Y|last8=Giessen|first8=H|title=High-power femtosecond mid-IR sources for s-SNOM applications|url=http://stacks.iop.org/2040-8986/16/i=9/a=094003?key=crossref.3eb2b21f107d58830fc324d0ec18d34e|journal=Journal of Optics|year=2014|volume=16|issue=9|page=094003|doi=10.1088/2040-8978/16/9/094003|bibcode=2014JOpt...16i4003H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stationary forms of Fourier-transform spectrometers==
In addition to the scanning forms of Fourier-transform spectrometers, there are a number of stationary or self-scanned forms.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Smith {{US patent|4976542}} Digital Array Scanned Interferometer, issued Dec. 11, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; While the analysis of the interferometric output is similar to that of the typical scanning interferometer, significant differences apply, as shown in the published analyses. Some stationary forms retain the Fellgett multiplex advantage, and their use in the spectral region where detector noise limits apply is similar to the scanning forms of the FTS. In the photon-noise limited region, the application of stationary interferometers is dictated by specific consideration for the spectral region and the application.

==Fellgett advantage==
{{Main article|Fellgett's advantage}}
One of the most important advantages of Fourier-transform spectroscopy was shown by P. B. Fellgett, an early advocate of the method. The Fellgett advantage, also known as the multiplex principle, states that when obtaining a spectrum when measurement noise is dominated by detector noise (which is independent of the power of radiation incident on the detector), a multiplex spectrometer such as a Fourier-transform spectrometer will produce a relative improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, compared to an equivalent scanning [[monochromator]], of the order of the square root of ''m'', where ''m'' is the number of sample points comprising the spectrum. However, if the detector is [[shot-noise]] dominated, the noise will be proportional to the square root of the power, thus for a broad boxcar spectrum (continuous broadband source), the noise is proportional to the square root of ''m'', thus precisely offset the Fellgett's advantage. Shot noise is the main reason Fourier-transform spectrometry was never popular for ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectra.

There are several theories as to the origin of the name ''Chhattisgarh'', which in ancient times was known as [[Dakshina Kosala]] (South Kosala),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/dakshinakosala|title=Dakshinakosala, Dakshina-kosala, Dakṣiṇakosala: 1 definition|last=www.wisdomlib.org|date=21 May 2017|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=29 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The native place of [[Bhagavan|bhagwan]] [[Rama]] as his mother name was [[Kausalya]], daughter of Kaushal Naresh.{{cn|date=June 2020}} &quot;Chhattisgarh&quot; was popularised later during the time of the [[Maratha Empire]] and was first used in an official document in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/history.html|title=History of Chhattisgarh|website=www.mapsofindia.com|access-date=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826100529/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/history.html|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular theory claims that Chhattisgarh takes its name from the 36 ancient forts in the area.{{cn|date=June 2020}} (''chhattis''—thirty-six, and ''garh''—[[fort]].) The old state had 36 demesnes (feudal territories): [[Ratanpur, Chhattisgarh|Ratanpur]], Vijaypur, Kharound, Maro, Kautgarh, [[Nawagarh]], Sondhi, Aukhar, Padarbhatta, Semriya, Champa, Lafa, Chhuri, Kenda, Matin, Aparora, Pendra, Kurkuti-kandri, Raipur, Patan, Simaga, Singarpur, Lavan, Omera, Durg, Saradha, Sirasa, Menhadi, Khallari, Sirpur, Figeswar, Rajim, Singhangarh, Suvarmar, Tenganagarh and Akaltara.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Bhagvan Singh Verma, ''Chhattisgarh ka Itihas'' (A History of Chhattisgarh&amp;nbsp;– in Hindi), Madhya Pradesh Hindi Granth Academy, Bhopal (M.P.), 4th edition (2003), p.7&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians disagree with this theory as 36 forts have not been found and identified.

According to the opinion of Dr. Hiralal, It is said that at one time there were 36 strongholds in this area, that is why its name was Chhattisgarh. But even after the increase in the number of strongholds, there was no change in the name, Chhattisgarh is the [[State of India]] which has been given the status of 'Mahtari' (Mother). There are two regions in India which are named for special reasons.  Changed - one was '[[Magadha]]' which became &quot;[[Bihar]]&quot; due to the abundance of [[Buddhism]] viharas and the other was '[[Dakshina Kosala]]' which became &quot;Chhattisgarh&quot; due to the inclusion of thirty-six strongholds. 

Another view, more popular with experts and historians, is that Chhattisgarh is the corrupted form of ''Chedisgarh'' meaning ''Raj'' or &quot;[[Chedi Kingdom|Empire of the Chedis]]&quot;.{{cn|date=June 2020}} In ancient times, Chhattisgarh region had been part of the Chedi dynasty of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], in modern [[Odisha]]. In the medieval period up to 1803, a major portion of present eastern Chhattisgarh was part of the [[Sambalpur]] Kingdom of [[Odisha]].

In the north lies the edge of the great [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The [[Rihand River]], a tributary of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], drains this area. The eastern end of the [[Satpura Range]] and the western edge of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] form an east–west belt of hills that divide the [[Mahanadi River]] basin from the Indo-Gangetic plain. The outline of Chhattisgarh is like a sea horse.

The central part of the state lies in the fertile upper basin of the Mahanadi river and its tributaries. This area has extensive rice cultivation. The upper Mahanadi basin is separated from the upper [[Narmada River|Narmada]] basin to the west by the [[Maikal Hill]]s (part of the Satpuras) and from the plains of Odisha to the east by ranges of hills. The southern part of the state lies on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan plateau]], in the watershed of the [[Godavari River]] and its tributary, the [[Indravati River]]. The Mahanadi is the chief river of the state. The other main rivers are [[Hasdeo River|Hasdeo]] (a tributary of Mahanadi), [[Rihand]], [[Indravati]], [[Jonk River|Jonk]], Arpa and Shivnath. It is situated in the east of Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Major_Rivers_Flowing_in_Chhattisgarh|title=Major Rivers Flowing in Chhattisgarh -|website=india-wris.nrsc.gov.in|access-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005120535/http://www.india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Major_Rivers_Flowing_in_Chhattisgarh|archive-date=5 October 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

=== Climate ===
The [[climate]] of Chhattisgarh is tropical. It is hot and humid because of its proximity to the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and its dependence on the [[monsoon]]s for rains. Summer temperatures in Chhattisgarh can reach up to 49&amp;nbsp;°C (113&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chtenvis.nic.in/Climate.html|title=Chhattisgarh {{!}} Institute|website=chtenvis.nic.in|access-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813230036/http://www.chtenvis.nic.in/Climate.html|archive-date=13 August 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monsoon season is from late June to October and is a welcome respite from the heat. Chhattisgarh receives an average of {{convert|1292|mm}} of rain. Winter is from November to January. Winters are pleasant with low temperatures and less humidity. Ambikapur, Mainpat, pendra road, samri, Jashpur are some of the coldest places in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pragati Infosoft Pvt.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Chhattisgarh has coverage of mostly two-lane or one-lane roads which provides connectivity to major cities. Eleven national highways passing through the state which are together 3078.40&amp;nbsp;km in length. However, most national highways are in poor condition and provide only two lanes for slow moving traffic. Many national highways are on paper and not fully converted into four-lane highway. This includes 130A New, 130B New, 130C New, 130D New, 149B New, 163A
New, 343 New, 930New..  Other national highway includes [[National Highway 6 (India)|NH 6]], [[National Highway 16 (India)|NH 16]], [[National Highway 43 (India)|NH 43]], [[National Highway 12A (India)|NH 12A]], [[National Highway 78 (India)|NH 78]], [[National Highway 111 (India)|NH 111]], [[National Highway 200 (India)|NH 200]], [[National Highway 202 (India)|NH 202]], [[National Highway 216 (India)|NH 216]], [[National Highway 217 (India)|NH 217]], [[National Highway 221 (India)|NH 221]], [[National Highway 30 (India)|NH30]]NH 930 NEW. The [[State Highway (India)|state highways]] and major district roads constitute another network of 8,031&amp;nbsp;km.

Chhattisgarh has one of the lowest densities of National Highway in Central and South India (12.1&amp;nbsp;km/100,000 population) which is similar to the North Eastern state of [[Assam]].

=== Rail network ===
[[File:Raipur Railway Station Entrance.jpg|thumb|Raipur Railway Station Entrance]]
Almost the entire railway network spread over the state comes under the geographical jurisdiction of the [[South East Central Railway]] Zone of Indian Railways centred around [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]], which is the zonal headquarters of this zone. Almost 85% of tracks are electrified, the non-electrified route is Maroda - Bhanupratappur line from Durg-Bhanupratappur branch line which is 120&amp;nbsp;km long. The main railway junctions are [[Bilaspur Junction]], {{rws|Durg Junction}} and Raipur, which is also a starting point of many long-distance trains. These three junctions are well-connected to the major cities of India and also these station comes under the top 50 booking stations in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;rail-secr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&amp;id=0,1,652,653|title=South East Central Railways|publisher=South East Central Railway|accessdate=23 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709223243/http://www.secr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&amp;id=0,1,652,653|archive-date=9 July 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has the highest freight loading in the country and one-sixth of Indian Railway's revenue comes from Chhattisgarh. The length of rail network in the state is 1,108&amp;nbsp;km, while a third track has been commissioned between Durg and Raigarh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Commerce &amp; Industry Chhattisgarh |url=http://industries.cg.gov.in/connectivity.htm |publisher=Government of Chhattisgarh |accessdate=23 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715035303/http://industries.cg.gov.in/connectivity.htm |archivedate=15 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of some new railway lines include Dalli-Rajhara–Jagdalpur rail line, Pendra Road-Gevra Road Rail Line rail line, Raigarh-Mand Colliery to Bhupdeopur rail line and Barwadih-Chirmiri rail line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposed new rail line to bring Mumbai, Kolkata closer|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/proposed-new-rail-line-to-bring-mumbai-kolkata-closer-110030300025_1.html|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=Business Standard|date=3 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506202213/http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/proposed-new-rail-line-to-bring-mumbai-kolkata-closer-110030300025_1.html|archive-date=6 May 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freight/goods trains provide services mostly to coal and iron ore industries in east–west corridor (Mumbai-Howrah route). There is a lack of passenger services to north and south of Chhattisgarh. Current train stations are mostly overcrowded and not maintained well for passengers.

=== Air ===
[[File:Swami Vivekananda Airport Raipur.JPG|thumbnail|right|Swami Vivekananda Airport Raipur]]
The air infrastructure in Chhattisgarh is small compared to other states. [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] in [[Raipur]] is its sole airport with scheduled commercial air services. A massive reduction in sales tax on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) from 25 to 4% in Chhattisgarh in 2003 has contributed to a sharp rise in passenger flow. The passenger flow has increased by 58% between 2011 and November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pranab hopes Raipur airport's new terminal will support Chhattisgarh's growth|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pranab-hopes-raipur-airports-new-terminal-will-support-chhattisgarhs-growth/article4075110.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=8 November 2012|accessdate=22 April 2013|location=Chennai, India|first=Suvojit|last=Bagchi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904045832/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pranab-hopes-raipur-airports-new-terminal-will-support-chhattisgarhs-growth/article4075110.ece|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major areas in the north and south of state, and industrial cities such as Bilaspur, Korba, Raigarh are not served by any airline. The majority of the population in these areas is not able to take advantage of low-cost airlines due to poor road connectivity and high cost of taxi fares.  The State Government has signed a [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]] with the [[Airports Authority of India]] (AAI) in July 2013 to develop [[Raigarh Airport]], Jagadalpur, Ambikapur for domestic flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chhattisgarh's second airport worth Rs 2,800 million in Raigarh soon|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-24/raipur/40770639_1_international-flights-second-airport-airport-development|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date= 24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under UDAN regional connectivity plan Jagdalpur airport was briefly connected to Raipur by Air Odisha. Chhattisgarh which is larger than Bengal, Tamil Nadu or countries like North Korea lacks civilian airports and does not have major state-level civil aviation policy.

=== Colonial and post-independence history ===
{{See also|Chhattisgarh Division}}
Chhattisgarh was under [[Maratha]] rule (Bhonsales of Nagpur) from 1741 to 1845 AD. It came under British rule from 1845 to 1947 as the [[Chhattisgarh Division]] of the [[Central Provinces]]. Raipur gained prominence over the capital Ratanpur with the advent of the British in 1845. In 1905, the [[Sambalpur district]] was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.

The area constituting the new state merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]] and remained a part of that state for 44 years. Prior to its becoming a part of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, the region was part of old Madhya Pradesh State, with its capital at Bhopal. Prior to that, the region was part of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] (CP and Berar) under British rule. Some areas constituting the Chhattisgarh state were [[princely state]]s under the British rule, but later on were merged into Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133300/http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation of Chhattisgarh ===
[[File:Secretariat in Naya Raipur.JPG|thumb|Mantralaya in Naya (New) Raipur]]
The present state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgfinance.nic.in&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeenews.india.com&quot; /&gt; The demand for a separate state was first raised in the 1920s. Similar demands kept cropping up at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never launched. Several all-party platforms were formed and they usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prithak Chhattisgarh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prithak Chhattisgarh |url=http://cg.gov.in/profile/corigin.htm#prathak |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704202817/http://cg.gov.in/profile/corigin.htm |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A demand for separate Chhattisgarh was raised in 1924 by the Raipur Congress unit and also discussed in the Annual Session of the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion also took place of forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh. When the State Reorganisation Commission was set up in 1954, the demand for a separate Chhattisgarh was put forward but was not accepted. In 1955, a demand for a separate state was raised in the Nagpur assembly of the then state of Madhya Bharat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prithak Chhattisgarh&quot; /&gt;

The 1990s saw more activity for a demand for the new state, such as the formation of a statewide political forum, especially the Chhattisgarh Rajya Nirman Manch. [[Chandulal Chadrakar]] led this forum, several successful region-wide strikes and rallies were organised under the banner of the forum, all of which were supported by major political parties, including the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prithak Chhattisgarh&quot; /&gt;

The new National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government sent the redrafted Separate Chhattisgarh Bill for the approval of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, where it was once again unanimously approved and then it was tabled in the [[Lok Sabha]]. This bill for a separate Chhattisgarh was passed in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, paving the way for the creation of a separate state of Chhattisgarh. The [[President of India]] gave his consent to the [[Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act]] 2000 on 25 August 2000. The government of India subsequently set 1 November 2000, as the day the state of Madhya Pradesh would be divided into Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prithak Chhattisgarh&quot; /&gt;

The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the [[1922 British Mount Everest Expedition]] by [[George Finch (chemist)|George Finch]] and [[Geoffrey Bruce (mountaineer)|Geoffrey Bruce]] who climbed up to {{convert|7800|m|ft|abbr=on}} at a spectacular speed of 1,000 vertical feet per hour (vf/h). Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to {{convert|8100|m|ft|abbr=on}} at 900 vf/h—nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[George Mallory]] described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Holzel|author2=Audrey Salkeld|title=The Mystery of Mallory &amp; Irvine|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Tenzing Norgay|Tenzing]] and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|open-circuit bottled oxygen sets]], with the expedition's physiologist [[Griffith Pugh]] referring to the oxygen debate as a &quot;futile controversy&quot;, noting that oxygen &quot;greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ascent of Everest|first=John|last=Hunt|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|year=1953|chapter=Appendix VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.

[[Reinhold Messner]] was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with [[Peter Habeler]], made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it ''should'' be climbed.&lt;ref name=Krakauer-1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krakauer|first1=Jon|title=Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster|date=1997|publisher=Villard|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-45752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|154}}

The aftermath of the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|1996 disaster]] further intensified the debate. [[Jon Krakauer]]'s ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summitted after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.

The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/07featurea.html|title=Everest controversy continues| website=Salon|date=7 August 1998|accessdate=17 June 2016|author=DeWalt, Weston|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043017/http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/07featurea.html | archive-date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]]'s decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]'') state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boukreev.org/The%20Oxygen%20Illusion.htm |title=The Oxygen Illusion|publisher=The Anatoli Boukreev Memorial Fund|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.&lt;ref name=&quot;salongarner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/cov_03feature3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303032319/http://www.salon.com/wlust/feature/1998/08/cov_03feature3.html|archivedate=3 March 2000|title=Coming Down|page=3|first=Dwight|last=Garner|work=Salon|date=August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,&lt;ref name=&quot;salongarner&quot;/&gt; but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in ''The Climb'', &quot;For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that.&quot;&lt;ref name=The_Climb&gt;{{cite book|title=The Climb|last1=Boukreev|first1=Anatoli|last2=DeWalt|first2=Weston|publisher=St. Martins Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-312-96533-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/climbtragicambit00bouk/page/182 182]|year=1998|title-link=The Climb (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as &quot;delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia&quot; even after returning to lower altitudes.&lt;ref name=altitude&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-8924-this-is-your-brain-this-is-your-brain-at-altitude.html|title=This is your brain.

===Autumn climbing===
[[File:Mount Everest as seen from Drukair.jpg|thumb|Everest in September 2006]]
Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the &quot;post-monsoon season&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;autumn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=fall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/10/22/money/first-everest-ascent-in-autumn-in-10-yrs/214039/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721191741/http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/10/22/money/first-everest-ascent-in-autumn-in-10-yrs/214039/|archivedate=21 July 2015|title=The Kathmandu Post :: Read the Post.

===1988: First climb and glide===
On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, [[Jean-Marc Boivin]] made the first [[paraglider]] descent of Everest,&lt;ref name=&quot;A view from the top of the world&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6334653.stm|title=A view from the top of the world|work=BBC News|date=15 February 2007|access-date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: &quot;I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.&quot;&lt;ref name=Back&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Harlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=boivin%20everest&amp;pg=PA1|title=Get Down|journal=Backpacker Magazine|date=May 1989|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boivin ran {{convert|60|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at {{convert|19400|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes).&lt;ref name=Back/&gt;&lt;ref name=glider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flymicro.com/everest/index.cfm?page=docs%2FHistory%2FHang_gliders_and_Paragliders.htm#_1986|title=Hang glider and Paraglider expeditions to Everest|publisher=flymicro.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, base-jumping off Venezuela's [[Angel Falls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;splatula&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blincmagazine.com/forum/wiki/Jean-Marc_Boivin | title=BASE Fatality List{{Snd}} Jean-Marc Boivin | publisher=blincmagazine.com | date=23 January 2016 | accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991: Hot air balloon flyover===
In 1991 four men in two balloons achieved the first [[hot-air balloon]] flight over Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=&quot;balloon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-03/a-hot-air-balloon-ride-over-mt-everest-will-cost-you-2-6-million.html|title=A Hot-Air Balloon Ride Over Mt.

===2005: Pilot summits with helicopter===
[[File:Eurocopter AS-350B-3 Ecureuil AN0980259.jpg|thumb|Photo of a Eurocopter AS350 B3 &quot;Squirrel&quot;]]
In May 2005, pilot [[Didier Delsalle]] of France landed a [[Eurocopter AS350]] B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurocopter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-t.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0510/0509/whats_new/helicopter_everest.html|title=Landing on Air|publisher=National Geographic Adventure|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=24 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706033814/http://www-t.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0510/0509/whats_new/helicopter_everest.html|archivedate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He needed to land for two minutes to set the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurocopter&quot;/&gt; In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set [[rotorcraft]] world [[List of Mount Everest records|records]], for highest of both landing and take-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;fai&quot;/&gt;

Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier,&lt;ref name=everestnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/FrenchEverestMysteryChoppersUtopiasummit-VIDEOMay272005.shtml|title=French Everest Mystery Chopper's Utopia summit|publisher=MountEverest.net|date=27 May 2005|access-date=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113192323/http://www.mounteverest.net/story/FrenchEverestMysteryChoppersUtopiasummit-VIDEOMay272005.shtml|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.&lt;ref name=&quot;fai&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://records.fai.org/rotorcraft/history.asp?id1=112&amp;id2=80&amp;id3=1&amp;id4=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202045947/http://records.fai.org/rotorcraft/history.asp?id1=112&amp;id2=80&amp;id3=1&amp;id4=2|archivedate=2 December 2008|title=Rotorcraft World Records|publisher=FAI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at {{convert|16000|ft|m|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurocopter&quot;/&gt;

===2011 Paraglide off summit===
In 2011 two Nepali paraglided from the Everest Summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews1&quot;/&gt; They had run out of oxygen and supplies, so it was a very fast way off the mountain.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews1&quot;/&gt; The duo won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/adventurers-of-the-year/2012/sanobabu-sunuwar-lakpa-tsheri-sherpa/ |title=Sano Babu Sunuwar and Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa, Adventurers of the Year 2012 – National Geographic |publisher=Adventure.nationalgeographic.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the paraglide they [[Kayaking|kayaked]] to the Indian Ocean, and they had made it to the Bay of Bengal by the end of June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;/&gt; One had never climbed, and one had never para-glided, but together they accomplished a ground-breaking feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;/&gt; By 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program ''[[Nightline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/ultimate-descent-paragliding-off-everest-21242814 |title=Ultimate Descent: Paragliding off Everest Video{{Snd}} ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent===
In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer [[Wang Jing (mountaineer)|Wang Jing]] used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Chip|title=Chinese Woman Becomes First to Summit Everest After Avalanche|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140525-everest-nepal-sherpas-climber-climbing-chinese-summit-avalanche-namche/|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=16 December 2017|language=en|date=25 May 2014|quote=Next year I think maybe I will relax.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gornyack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelkov|first1=Alexander|title=Ван Цзин{{Snd}} миллионерша, красавица, мама и скандальная рекордсменка мира (Wang Jing{{Snd}} millionaire, beauty, mother and scandalous world record holder)|url=http://xn--80afvlem1dxc.xn--p1ai/articles/all/article_8058/|website=ГорнЯшкА.рф|publisher=Gornyack.com|accessdate=18 December 2017|language=ru|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal ended up investigating [[#Jing Wang|Wang]], who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma |first=Gopal |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nepal-china-everest-idUSKBN0E70UO20140527 |title=Nepal probes if Chinese woman used helicopter on Everest climb |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. &quot;If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home,&quot; she said in an interview. In that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot; /&gt;

Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepalese interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and provided the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot;/&gt; National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the [[International Mountaineer of the Year Award]] from the Nepal government in June 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic2&quot;/&gt;

===2016: Helicopter business increases===
In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.dw.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.dw.com/adventuresports/2016/04/23/helicopter-transport-flights-to-everest-high-camps/ |title=Helicopter transport flights to Everest high camps{{Snd}} Mount Everest|publisher=Blogs.dw.com{{Snd}} Adventure Sports|date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902225132/http://blogs.dw.com/adventuresports/2016/04/23/helicopter-transport-flights-to-everest-high-camps/ |archivedate=2 September 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.dw.com&quot;/&gt; After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 deaths and earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.dw.com&quot;/&gt; That summer Bell tested the [[Bell 412#Variants|412EPI]], which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 18,000 feet and flying as high as 20,000 feet altitude near Mount Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergqvist |first=Pia |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/bell-helicopter-tests-412epi-near-mount-everest |title=Bell Helicopter Tests 412EPI Near Mount Everest &amp;#124; Flying Magazine |publisher=Flyingmag.com |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial cost of guided climbs==
Climbing Mount Everest can be a relatively expensive undertaking for climbers.

Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|bottled oxygen]], which adds around US$3,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$25,000 per person, depending on the size of the team.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The ascent typically starts at one of the [[Everest base camps|two base camps]] near the mountain, both of which are approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} from [[Kathmandu]] and {{convert|300|km|mi}} from [[Lhasa]] (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Going with a &quot;celebrity guide&quot;, usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11794351/Kenton-Cool-my-journey-from-a-wheelchair-to-the-peak-of-Mount-Everest.html|title=Kenton Cool: my journey from a wheelchair to the peak of Mount Everest|date=11 August 2015|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 September 2015|last1=Stadlen|first1=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.&lt;ref name=thefever/&gt; There are issues with the management of guiding firms in Nepal, and one Canadian woman was left begging for help when her guide firm, which she had paid perhaps US$40,000 to, couldn't stop her from dying in 2012. She ran out of bottled oxygen after climbing for 27 hours straight. Despite decades of concern over inexperienced climbers, neither she nor the guide firm had summited Everest before. The Tibetan/Chinese side has been described as &quot;out of control&quot; due to reports of thefts and threats.&lt;ref name=stolen/&gt; By 2015, Nepal was considering to require that climbers have some experience and wanted to make the mountain safer, and especially increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Burke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/mount-everest-to-be-declared-off-limits-to-inexperienced-climbers |title=Mount Everest to be declared off-limits to inexperienced climbers, says Nepal |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 28 September 2015|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money ''not'' taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mt-everest-summit-fever-why-climbers-make-poor-decisions-near-peak/news-story/3502b64dc81a65fec0466bf1983efff5 |title=Mt Everest 'summit fever': Why climbers make poor decisions near peak  |website=Herald Sun |location=[[Melbourne]], Australia |date=28 May 2016 |accessdate=17 June 2016 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price{{mdash}}that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;/&gt; Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;/&gt;

==Commercial climbing==

According to [[Jon Krakauer]], the era of [[commercialization|commercialisation]] of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by [[David Breashears]] that included [[Richard Bass]], a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-02/news/mn-20109_1_climbed-mt-everest|title=Conquers Mt. Everest to Fulfill Dream: Millionaire First to Climb Summits of All Continents|journal=Los Angeles Times|first=Bill|last=Stall|date=2 May 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. [[Rob Hall]], one of the mountaineers who died in the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|1996 disaster]], had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.&lt;ref name=Krakauer-1997/&gt;{{RP|24,42}}

By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000–200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;/&gt; However, the services offered vary widely and it is &quot;buyer beware&quot; when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developingworldconnections.org/destination/nepal/ |title=Nepal |publisher=Developing World Connections |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is about four percent of Nepal's economy, but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nations's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conger |first=Cristen |url=http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/climbing/mt-everest-tourism.htm |title=How has Mount Everest tourism affected Nepal? &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |publisher=Adventure.howstuffworks.com |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond this point, costs may vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are &quot;budget&quot; travel agencies which offer logistical support for such trips. However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of [[David Sharp (mountaineer)|David Sharp]]). Many climbers hire &quot;full service&quot; guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, [[fixed ropes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/expguide/ropes.htm|title=Fixed ropes}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000–80,000 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outdoors.whatitcosts.com/mt-everest-pg3.htm|title=What It Costs To Climb Mount Everest|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most equipment is moved by [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]], clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under {{convert|10|kg}}, or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like [[Denali]], are often expected to carry backpacks over {{convert|30|kg}} and, occasionally, to tow a [[sled]] with {{convert|35|kg}} of gear and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpineinstitute.com/media/79087/denali_phycond.pdf|title=The Physical Demands of Climbing Denali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG-20130600&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mark|title=Maxed Out on Everest|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/06/125-everest-maxed-out/jenkins-text|accessdate=31 January 2017|work=National Geographic|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamling Tenzing Norgay]], the son of [[Tenzing Norgay]], said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, &quot;You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on [[crampons]]. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardianweekly/story/0,12674,961195,00.html|title=Everest's decline blamed on trail of rich tourists |work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Messner]] concurred in 2004, &quot;You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1315445,00.html|title=Home on the range |work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. For example, [[Edmund Hillary]], who went on record saying that he has not liked &quot;the commercialisation of mountaineering, particularly of Mount Everest&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_400/455b_sir-edmund-hillary-the-right-stuff.html|title=Sir Edmund Hillary: The Right Stuff|access-date=13 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202175746/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_400/455b_sir-edmund-hillary-the-right-stuff.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that &quot;Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2938596.stm|title=Hillary laments Everest changes |work=BBC News | date=26 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, &quot;I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s843061.htm| title=Interview with Sir Edmund Hillary|website=Foreign Correspondent|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=29 April 2003|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of [[Seven Summits]] fame) responded in an interview about Everest climbers and what it took to survive there, &quot;Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [20,320 feet] or Aconcagua [22,834 feet] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=bass&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/11/12/cz_jc_1112sport.html|title=The Adventurer: Dick Bass' Many Summits|author=James Clash|date=12 November 2003|website=Forbes|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and order===
Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches.

==2014 Sherpa strike==
On 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche|avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest]].

==Extreme sports at Mount Everest==
[[File:Img20040730 0302 at neustift.jpg|thumb|A paraglider at Neustift, Tirol, Austria]]

Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.

[[Yuichiro Miura]] became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.&lt;ref name=japtimes/&gt; Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;TransWorld SNOWboarding&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snowboarding.transworld.net/uncategorized/mount-everest-snowboard-controversy-solved/|title=Mount Everest Snowboard Controversy Solved|date=27 June 2001|website=TransWorld SNOWboarding|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Everest skiers include [[Davo Karničar]] of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, [[Hans Kammerlander]] of Italy in 1996 on the north side,&lt;ref name=&quot;kammerlander&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.igluski.com/features/skiing-everest | title=Skiing Down Mount Everest and the World's Highest Peaks | publisher=igluski.com | accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006.&lt;ref name=Hawley&gt;{{cite book|last=Salisbury|first=Richard|title=The Himalayan database the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley|year=2004|publisher=American Alpine Club Press|location=Golden, CO|isbn=978-0-930410-99-5|url=http://www.himalayandatabase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Swede [[Tomas Olsson]] and Norwegian [[Tormod Granheim]] skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor broke while they were [[rappelling]] down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III.&lt;ref name=skii&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelexplorations.com/tomas-olsson-found-dead-skiing-down-from-the-north-side-of-mount-everest-ended-in-tradegy.326749-18558.html|title=Tomas Olsson found dead{{Snd}} Skiing down from the North side of Mount Everest ended in tragedy!|website=travelexplorations.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;TransWorld SNOWboarding&quot;/&gt;

Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 [[Steve McKinney (skier)|Steve McKinney]] led an expedition to Mount Everest,&lt;ref name=&quot;Unsworth2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Walt Unsworth|title=Everest: The Mountaineering History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STs1loP7sfsC|year=2000|publisher=Mountaineers|location=London|isbn=978-0-89886-670-4|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which he became the first person to fly a [[hang-gliding|hang-glider]] off the mountain.&lt;ref name=glider/&gt; Frenchman [[Jean-Marc Boivin]] made the first [[paraglider]] descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;A view from the top of the world&quot;/&gt; In 2011, two Nepalese made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down {{convert|16400|ft|m|order=flip}} in 45 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/trips/bucket-list/2013/ultimate-descent/|title=Ultimate Adventure Bucket List{{Snd}} Dream Trip: Make the Ultimate Descent|author1=Sano Babu Sunuwar|author2=Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa|name-list-style=amp|website=National Geographic|accessdate=20 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918123049/http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/trips/bucket-list/2013/ultimate-descent/|archivedate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 2013, the beverage company [[Red Bull]] sponsored [[Valery Rozov]], who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a [[wingsuit]], setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everest Base Jumper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Tarquin|date=28 May 2013|url=http://www.redbull.com/en/adventure/stories/1331592877474/valery-rozov-base-mount-everest|title=Valery Rozov BASE Jumps From Mt Everest|publisher=[[Red Bull]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everest and religion==
[[File:Rongbuk Monastery Everest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rongphu Monastery]], with Mount Everest in the background]]
The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several &quot;hidden valleys&quot; of refuge designated by [[Padmasambhava]], a ninth-century &quot;[[Lotus birth|lotus-born]]&quot; Buddhist saint.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo1&quot;/&gt;

Near the base of the north side of Everest lies [[Rongbuk Monastery]], which has been called the &quot;sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Jeanne-Marie |title=Rongbuk Monastery |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/history/rongbukmon.html |website=[[PBS]] |access-date=14 September 2013 |date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] living on the slopes of Everest in the [[Khumbu]] region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through [[Nangpa La]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tenzing |last1=Norgay |first2=James |last2=Ramsey Ullman |author-link1=Tenzing Norgay |author-link2=James Ramsey Ullman |title=Man of Everest: The Autobiography of Tenzing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJR6nQEACAAJ |year=1955 |publisher=[[G.G. Harrap]] |others=also published as ''Tiger of the Snows'' |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miyolangsangma]], a [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhist]] &quot;''Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving''&quot;, is believed to have lived at the top of Mt Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mt Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo1&quot;/&gt;

The [[Sherpa people]] also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the [[karma|karmic]] effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Coburn |first=Broughton |title=Mount Everest Fight Raises Questions About Sherpas |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130501-mount-everest-fight-sherpas-sahibs-world-mountain-climbing/ |work=[[National Geographic News]] |access-date=14 September 2013 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |agency=[[National Geographic Partners, LLC.]] |date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
In 2015 the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as &quot;26,500 pounds of human excrement&quot; each season is left behind on the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holley |first=Peter |title=Morning Mix Decades of human waste have made Mount Everest a 'fecal time bomb' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/03/decades-of-human-waste-have-made-mount-everest-a-fecal-time-bomb/ |access-date=31 January 2017 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Brent |title=Peak Poop: The Feces Problem on Everest Needs a Solution |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1965696/peak-poop-feces-problem-everest-needs-solution |access-date=31 January 2017 |magazine=[[Outside Online]] |date=7 April 2015 |publisher=Mariah Media Network LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepalese government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saul |first=Heather |title=Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest is causing pollution and could spread diseases |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/human-waste-left-by-climbers-on-mount-everest-is-causing-pollution-and-could-spread-diseases-10081562.html |access-date=31 January 2017 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105040/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/human-waste-left-by-climbers-on-mount-everest-is-causing-pollution-and-could-spread-diseases-10081562.html |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the [[Rongbuk Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-47249141|title=China closes Everest base camp to tourists|date=15 February 2019|access-date=15 February 2019|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, the [[Solukhumbu District|Solukhumbu district]]'s [[Khumbu Pasanglhamu]] Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg of garbage from Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/major-clean-up-of-everest-aims-to-bring-back-10000kg-garbage-bodies-of-dead-climbers|title=Major cleanup of Everest aims to bring back 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg of garbage, bodies of dead climbers|last=hermesauto|date=29 April 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=1 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

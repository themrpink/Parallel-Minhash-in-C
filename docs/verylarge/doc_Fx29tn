Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the [[transgenic]] mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster [[metabolism]]s and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mhtt fragments [[Protein folding|misfold]] led to the discovery of the nuclear inclusions they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ross-tabrizi /&gt;

The condition was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term has been replaced by 'Huntington's disease' because not all patients develop chorea and due to the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=huntchorea&gt;{{cite web|title=What is HD?|url=http://www.hda.org.uk/huntingtons/what-is-hd.html|publisher=Huntington's disease association|access-date=18 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213133025/http://www.hda.org.uk/huntingtons/what-is-hd.html|archive-date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
{{See also|In vitro fertilisation#Ethics|Stem cell controversy}}

Huntington's disease, particularly the application of the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when [[Charles Davenport]] proposed in 1910 that [[compulsory sterilization]] and [[immigration]] control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the [[eugenics]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport CB | title = Huntington's Chorea in Relation to Heredity and Eugenics | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 283–5 | date = May 1915 | pmid = 16575999 | pmc = 1090803 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1.5.283 | bibcode = 1915PNAS....1..283D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[In vitro fertilization]] has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of [[Ethics of animal research|animal testing]] and [[embryonic stem cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rollin BE | title = The regulation of animal research and the emergence of animal ethics: a conceptual history | url = https://org.uib.no/dyreavd/handouts/Rollin__B._2006._Animal_Research_Regulation_in_Theoret._Medicin_....PDF | journal = Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 285–304 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16937023 | doi = 10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | s2cid = 18620094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18181947&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doerflinger RM | title = The problem of deception in embryonic stem cell research | journal = Cell Proliferation | volume = 41 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 65–70 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18181947 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2008.00492.x | pmc = 6496399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of an accurate diagnostic test for Huntington's disease has caused social, legal, and ethical concerns over access to and use of a person's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman MA | title = Predictive testing for adult-onset genetic disease: ethical and legal implications of the use of linkage analysis for Huntington disease | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–3 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 2140926 | pmc = 1683745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huggins M, Bloch M, Kanani S, Quarrell OW, Theilman J, Hedrick A, Dickens B, Lynch A, Hayden M | title = Ethical and legal dilemmas arising during predictive testing for adult-onset disease: the experience of Huntington disease | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–12 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 1971997 | pmc = 1683755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many guidelines and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals to decide when and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; [[Financial institution]]s and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies agreed with the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] that until 2017 customers would not need to disclose predictive genetics tests to them, but this agreement explicitly excluded the government-approved test for Huntington's when writing policies with a value over {{GBP|500,000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.abi.org.uk/News/News-releases/2011/04/Insurance-Genetics-Moratorium-extended-to-2017 |title=Insurance Genetics Moratorium extended to 2017 |access-date=13 January 2016 |publisher=Association of British Insurers |date=5 April 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043951/https://www.abi.org.uk/News/News-releases/2011/04/Insurance-Genetics-Moratorium-extended-to-2017 |archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Expert backs gene test disclosure&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Expert backs gene test disclosure|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6731623.stm|publisher=BBC article|date=7 June 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226155310/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6731623.stm|archive-date=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under [[Age of majority|legal age]] who is not judged to be [[Gillick competence|competent]] is considered unethical in most cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2136787&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8950670&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Binedell J, Soldan JR, Scourfield J, Harper PS | title = Huntington's disease predictive testing: the case for an assessment approach to requests from adolescents | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 912–8 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8950670 | pmc = 1050784 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.33.11.912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18704981&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borry P, Goffin T, Nys H, Dierickx K | title = Predictive genetic testing in minors for adult-onset genetic diseases | journal = The Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine, New York | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 287–96 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18704981 | doi = 10.1002/msj.20038 | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/223776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ethical concerns related to [[Prenatal diagnosis|prenatal genetic testing]] or [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] to ensure a child is not born with a given disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9949442&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braude PR, De Wert GM, Evers-Kiebooms G, Pettigrew RA, Geraedts JP | title = Non-disclosure preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington's disease: practical and ethical dilemmas | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 18 | issue = 13 | pages = 1422–6 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9949442 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0223(199812)18:13&lt;1422::AID-PD499&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9949442&quot;/&gt; As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent does not want to know his or her own diagnosis.  This would require parts of the process to be kept secret from the parent.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9949442&quot;/&gt;

===Support organizations===

[[File:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|The death of [[Woody Guthrie]] led to the foundation of the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America|Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease]]|alt=A black-and-white photograph taken indoors of Woody Guthrie wearing pinstripe trousers, a tartan shirt with top button undone, and a cap. He sits playing a six-string acoustic guitar, which is supported on one knee, and he appears to be singing. 'This Machine Kills Fascists' is written in all capital letters on a rectangular sticker, which is fixed onto the guitar.]]

In 1968, after experiencing HD in his wife's family, Dr. Milton Wexler was inspired to start the [[Hereditary Disease Foundation]] (HDF), with the aim of curing genetic illnesses by coordinating and supporting research.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDF-About Us&quot;/&gt; The foundation and Wexler's daughter, [[Nancy Wexler]], were key parts of the research team in Venezuela which discovered the HD gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDF-About Us&quot;/&gt;

At roughly the same time as the HDF formed, [[Marjorie Guthrie]] helped to found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease (now the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]]), after her husband [[Woody Guthrie]] died from complications of HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDSA2009&quot;/&gt;

Since then, support and research organizations have formed in many countries around the world and have helped to increase public awareness of HD. A number of these collaborate in umbrella organizations, like the International Huntington Association and the [[European Huntington's Disease Network|European HD network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huntington-assoc.com/ |title=The International Huntington Association |access-date=3 April 2009 |publisher=International Huntington Association |year=2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418154858/http://www.huntington-assoc.com/ |archive-date=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many support organizations hold an annual HD awareness event, some of which have been endorsed by their respective governments. For example, 6 June is designated &quot;National Huntington's Disease Awareness Day&quot; by the [[United States Senate|US Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-resolution/531|title=US Senate s. resolution 531|access-date=10 August 2008|work=S.

In 2006, it spent $50 million on Huntington's disease research.&lt;ref name=chdi-nature-moneytree /&gt; CHDI collaborates with many academic and commercial laboratories globally and engages in oversight and management of research projects as well as funding.&lt;ref name=chdi-nature-philanthropy&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Check E | title = Biomedical philanthropy: love or money | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7142 | pages = 252–3 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17507955 | doi = 10.1038/447252a | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..252C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations exist to support and inform those affected by HD, including the [[Huntington's Disease Association]] in the UK.

==Research directions==

Research into the mechanism of HD is focused on identifying the functioning of HTT, how mhtt differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIHHope2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Huntington's Disease: Hope Through Research |url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/patient-caregiver-education/hope-through-research/huntingtons-disease-hope-through |website=www.ninds.nih.gov |access-date=16 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is conducted using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting the early stages of [[drug development]].&lt;ref name=ross-tabrizi /&gt; Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the progressive features of the disease.&lt;ref name=turner-excitotoxicity&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner C, Schapira AH | title = Mitochondrial matters of the brain: the role in Huntington's disease | journal = Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–8 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20480217 | doi = 10.1007/s10863-010-9290-y | s2cid = 207185615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many [[transgenic animal]] models including [[nematode]] worms, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive [[neurodegeneration]] and HD-like symptoms.&lt;ref name=ross-tabrizi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross CA, Tabrizi SJ | title = Huntington's disease: from molecular pathogenesis to clinical treatment | journal = The Lancet.

Research is being conducted on many different approaches to prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIHHope2020&quot;/&gt; Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing the level of the mutant huntingtin protein (including [[gene splicing]] and [[gene silencing]]); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including [[protein homeostasis]] and [[histone deacetylase]] inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include [[phosphodiesterase inhibitors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wild EJ, Tabrizi SJ | title = Targets for future clinical trials in Huntington's disease: what's in the pipeline? | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 11 | pages = 1434–45 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25155142 | pmc = 4265300 | doi = 10.1002/mds.26007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20170503TOI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Shoshanna|title=Taube to fund $3m Huntington's disease research in US|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/taube-to-fund-3m-huntingtons-disease-research-in-us/|access-date=5 May 2017|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=3 May 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503135635/http://www.timesofisrael.com/taube-to-fund-3m-huntingtons-disease-research-in-us/|archive-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020 the CHDI Foundation began a small-molecule computational research collaboration with [[OpenEye Scientific Software|OpenEye Scientific]] focusing on small-molecule treatments, using a molecular design platform of OpenEye's known as ''Orion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CHDI&quot;/&gt; 

===Reducing huntingtin production===

[[Gene silencing]] aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a [[Genetic disorder#Single-gene|single dominant gene]] encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mhtt is reduced, symptoms improve.&lt;ref name=munoz-bates-jci&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munoz-Sanjuan I, Bates GP | title = The importance of integrating basic and clinical research toward the development of new therapies for Huntington disease | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 476–83 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21285520 | pmc = 3026740 | doi = 10.1172/JCI45364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of [[RNA interference]], and [[allele-specific oligonucleotide]] (ASO) methods of gene silencing has been demonstrated in mice and the larger primate macaque brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McBride JL, Pitzer MR, Boudreau RL, Dufour B, Hobbs T, Ojeda SR, Davidson BL | title = Preclinical safety of RNAi-mediated HTT suppression in the rhesus macaque as a potential therapy for Huntington's disease | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 2152–62 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22031240 | pmc = 3242667 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2011.219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kordasiewicz HB, Stanek LM, Wancewicz EV, Mazur C, McAlonis MM, Pytel KA, Artates JW, Weiss A, Cheng SH, Shihabuddin LS, Hung G, Bennett CF, Cleveland DW | title = Sustained therapeutic reversal of Huntington's disease by transient repression of huntingtin synthesis | journal = Neuron | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 1031–44 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22726834 | pmc = 3383626 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.05.009 | author9 = Seng H.

===Improving cell survival===
Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of mutant huntingtin are correction of [[transcriptional regulation]] using [[histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s, modulating [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of huntingtin, improving [[metabolism]] and [[Mitochondria|mitochondrial function]] and restoring function of [[synapses]].&lt;ref name=munoz-bates-jci/&gt;

===Neuronal replacement===
[[Stem-cell therapy]] is the replacement of damaged neurons by transplantation of [[stem cell]]s into affected regions of the brain.

===Clinical trials===
In 2020 over 900 clinical trials related to varied therapies and biomarkers for Huntington's disease were listed as either underway, recruiting or newly completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trials&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Search of: Huntington Disease - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov |url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Huntington+Disease&amp;term=&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist= |website=clinicaltrials.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Compounds that have failed to prevent or slow progression of Huntington's disease in human trials include [[remacemide]], [[coenzyme Q10]], [[riluzole]], [[creatine]], [[minocycline]], [[ethyl-EPA]], [[phenylbutyrate]] and [[dimebon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Clinical Trials|url=http://www.huntington-study-group.org/ClinicalResearch/CompletedClinicalTrials/tabid/65/Default.aspx|publisher=Huntington Study Group|access-date=4 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628020904/http://www.huntington-study-group.org/ClinicalResearch/CompletedClinicalTrials/tabid/65/Default.aspx|archive-date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogue Screen Shot CAR.PNG|thumb|A procedurally-generated dungeon in the 1980 video game ''Rogue'', the game after which the roguelike genre is named]]
{{Video RPG|state=collapsed}}
'''Roguelike''' (or '''rogue-like''') is a subgenre of [[role-playing video game]]s characterized by a [[dungeon crawl]] through [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] [[level (video gaming)|levels]], [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|turn-based gameplay]], tile-based graphics, and [[permanent death]] of the [[player character]]. Most roguelikes are based on a [[high fantasy]] narrative, reflecting their influence from [[tabletop role playing game]]s such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.

Though the roguelikes ''[[Beneath Apple Manor]]'' and ''[[Sword of Fargoal]]'' predate it, the 1980 game ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]'', which is an [[ASCII]] based game that runs in [[Computer terminal|terminal]] or [[terminal emulator]], is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring ''Rogue''{{-'}}s [[Text-based game|character-]] or [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite-based]] graphics. These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to hundreds of variants. Some of the better-known variants include ''[[Hack (Unix video game)|Hack]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Ancient Domains of Mystery]]'', ''[[Moria (video game)|Moria]]'', ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'', ''[[Tales of Maj'Eyal]]'', and ''[[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]]''. The Japanese series of ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], inspired by ''Rogue'', also fall within the concept of roguelike games.

The exact definition of a roguelike game remains a point of debate in the video game community. A &quot;Berlin Interpretation&quot; drafted in 2008 defined a number of high- and low-value factors that distinguished the &quot;pure&quot; roguelike games ''Rogue'', ''NetHack'' and ''Angband'' from edge cases like ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]''. Since then, with more powerful home computers and gaming systems and the rapid growth of [[indie game|indie video game development]], several new &quot;roguelikes&quot; have appeared, with some but not all of these high-value factors, nominally the use of procedural generation and permadeath, while often incorporating other gameplay genres, thematic elements, and graphical styles; common examples of these include ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[FTL: Faster Than Light]]'', and ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]''. To distinguish these from traditional roguelikes, such games may be referred to as &quot;rogue-lite&quot;, &quot;roguelike-like&quot;, or &quot;procedural death labyrinths&quot;.

==Origin==
The origin of the term &quot;roguelike&quot; came from [[USENET]] newsgroups around 1993, as this was the principal channel the players of roguelike games of that period were using to discuss these games, as well as what the developers used to announce new releases and even distribute the game's source code in some cases. With several individual groups for each game, it was suggested that with rising popularity of ''Rogue'', ''Hack'', ''Moria'', and ''Angband'', all which shared common elements, that the groups be consolidated under an umbrella term to facilitate cross-game discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | author = Solovay, Andrew. | title = CFV: rec.games.roguelike reorganization | date = July 27, 1993 | newsgroup = news.announce.newgroups | message-id = rec.games.roguelike-CFV1@uunet.uu.net  | quote = I would like to propose formally that a new hierarchy be created, namely rec.games.roguelike. This hierarchy would contain groups dedicated to discussion of rogue-type games.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | author = Panitz, Aliza. | title = Time for a new level of heirarchy? | date = June 18, 1993 | newsgroup = rec.games.moria | message-id = 1vsuhk$mj7@bronze.lcs.mit.edu | url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rec.games.moria/cMzFkzyfzyY/AfRupGIliEcJ | access-date = May 17, 2018 | quote = It seems to me that we'd do a lot better taking all of the dungeon-adventure games, including ones that don't have their own newsgroups like larn and omega, and reorganizing them under rec.games.dungeon – recognizing the intrinsic similarities of all these games.

==Gameplay and design==

===General gameplay===
Drawing from the concepts of [[tabletop role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', nearly all roguelikes give the player control of a character, which they may customize by selecting a [[Character class|class]], [[Race (fantasy)|race]], and gender, and adjusting [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]] points and [[Skill (role-playing games)|skills]]. At the start of the game, the character is placed at the top-most [[Level (computer and video games)|level]] of a dungeon, with basic equipment such as a simple weapon, armor, torches, and food. Following along the role-playing concept of a [[dungeon crawl]], the player moves the character through the dungeon, collecting treasure which can include new weapons, armours, magical devices, potions, scrolls, food, and money, while having to fight [[mob (video gaming)|monsters]] that roam the dungeon.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;/&gt; Most combat is performed simply by attempting to move the character into the same space as the monster. The game then calculates the damage that the character and monster deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock chp2&quot;/&gt; Other types of attacks, such as firing an arrow or performing an offensive magic spell, can often be performed as well.

Defeating monsters earns the character [[experience point]]s, and after earning enough points, the character will gain an experience level, improving their [[Health (gaming)|hit points]], [[Magic (gaming)|magic capability]], and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. The character dies if they lose all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of [[permadeath]], this represents the end of the game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock intro&quot;/&gt; Roguelikes are nearly always [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]], with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock intro&quot;/&gt; This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;/&gt;

The player generally has to explore the dungeon to reveal its contents, similar to a [[fog of war#in video games|fog of war]]. Many roguelikes include visibility elements, such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, or [[Line of sight (gaming)|line of sight]] to limit which monsters are visible from the player's position. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that an underdeveloped character will have difficulty progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using [[procedural generation]], so no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or defeating a specific monster that lives on that level.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock intro&quot;/&gt; Typical roguelikes assess the player's performance at the end of the game through a score based on the amount of treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player finished the game, if they managed to do so. The score is displayed in a ranked scoreboard to compare the player's performance on successive runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;play 80&quot;/&gt;

What gameplay elements explicitly define a &quot;roguelike&quot; game remains a point of debate within the video game community.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstech 2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/ | title = ASCII art + permadeath: The history of roguelike games | first = Richard C. | last = Moss | date = March 19, 2020 | accessdate = March 19, 2020 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is broad agreement that roguelike games incorporate gameplay elements popularized by the [[text-based game]] ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'' (1980), which bore out many variations due to its success;&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer 50&quot;/&gt; As of 2015, several hundred games claiming to be roguelikes were available through the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] game catalog,&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock intro&quot;&gt;Craddock 2015, Introduction: &quot;Rodney and Friends&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the user-run [[wiki]] RogueBasin tracks hundreds of roguelikes and their development.&lt;ref name=&quot;makeuseof spin&quot;/&gt;

Some players and developers sought a more narrow definition for &quot;roguelike&quot; as variations on ''Rogue'' introduced new concepts or eschewed other principles that they felt moved the games away from the flavor of what ''Rogue'' was.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstech 2020&quot;/&gt; At the International Roguelike Development Conference 2008 held in Berlin, Germany, players and developers established a definition for roguelikes known as the &quot;'''Berlin Interpretation'''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bi text&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation | title = Berlin Interpretation (definition of a &quot;Roguelike&quot;) | work = RogueBasin | accessdate = November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy roguelikes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/ftl-faster-than-light/1227287p1.html | title = Rise Of The Roguelikes: A Genre Evolves | first = Tom | last = Hatfield | date = January 29, 2013 | accessdate = April 24, 2013 | work = [[GameSpy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/12/column_play_the_berlin_interpr.php | title = COLUMN: @Play: The Berlin Interpretation | work = [[Game Set Watch]] | date = December 18, 2009 | first = John | last = Harris | accessdate = November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin Interpretation set out a set of high-value and low-value factors, basing these lists on five [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] roguelike games: ''ADOM'', ''Angband'', ''Linley's Dungeon Crawl'', ''NetHack'', and ''Rogue''. The Interpretation was designed to determine &quot;how roguelike a game is&quot;, noting that missing a factor does not eliminate a game from being a roguelike, nor does possessing the features make a game roguelike.&lt;ref name=&quot;bi text&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt; John Harris of ''[[Game Set Watch]]'' exemplified this by using these criteria to numerically score some seemingly roguelike games; ''Linley's Dungeon Crawl'' and ''NetHack'' scored highest, earning 57.5 points of 60 available based on the Interpretation, while ''Toe Jam &amp; Earl'' and ''Diablo'', games commonly compared to roguelikes, earned only about half of the points.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;

The Berlin Interpretation defined eight high-value factors:&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game uses random dungeon generation to increase replayability.&lt;ref name=&quot;1up essential&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-rogue | title = Essential 50: Part 12. Rogue | work = [[1UP.com]] | accessdate = March 29, 2010 | first = Jeremy | last = Parish | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092550/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-rogue | archivedate = February 28, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games may include pre-determined levels such as a town level common to the ''[[Moria (video game)|Moria]]'' family where the player can buy and sell equipment, but these are considered to reduce the randomness set by the Berlin Interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt; This &quot;random generation&quot; is nearly always based on some [[procedural generation]] approach rather than true randomness. Procedural generation uses a set of rules defined by the game developers to seed the generation of the dungeon generally to assure that each level of the dungeon can be completed by the player without special equipment, and also can generally more aesthetically-pleasing levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshBycer/20150807/250760/Procedural_vs_Randomly_Generated_Content_in_Game_Design.php | title = Procedural vs. Randomly Generated Content in Game Design | first = Josh | last =Bycer | date = August 7, 2015 | accessdate = March 19, 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The game uses [[permadeath]]. Once a character dies, the player must begin a new game, known as a &quot;run&quot;, which will regenerate the game's levels anew due to procedural generation. A &quot;save game&quot; feature will only provide suspension of gameplay and not a limitlessly recoverable state; the [[Saved game|stored session]] is deleted upon resumption or character death. Players can circumvent this by backing up stored game data (&quot;save scumming&quot;), an act that is usually considered [[Cheating (video games)|cheating]]; the developers of ''Rogue'' introduced the permadeath feature after introducing a save function, finding that players were repeatedly loading saved games to achieve the best results.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock chp2&quot;/&gt; According to ''Rogue''{{'}}s Michael Toy, they saw their approach to permadeath not as a means to make the game painful or difficult but to put weight on every decision the player made as to create a more immersive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/281688/Rogue_cocreator_permadeath_was_never_supposed_to_be_about_pain.php | title = Rogue co-creator: permadeath was never supposed to be 'about pain' | first = Bryant | last = Francis | date = September 19, 2016 | accessdate = September 28, 2016 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The game is [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]], giving the player as much time as needed to make a decision. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are performed serially and take a variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on the passage of time dictated by these actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game is [[Mode (user interface)|non-modal]], in that every action should be available to the player regardless where they are in the game. The Interpretation notes that shops like in ''Angband'' do break this non-modality.
* The game has a degree of complexity due to the number of different game systems in place that allow the player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating [[emergent gameplay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra heart&quot;/&gt; For example, to get through a locked door, the player may attempt to pick the lock, kick it down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with ''NetHack'' is &quot;The Dev Team Thinks of Everything&quot; in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible combination of actions that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one's character while wielding the corpse of a [[cockatrice]] as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock chp6&quot;/&gt;
* The player must use resource management to survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt; Items that help sustain the player, such as food and healing items, are in limited supply, and the player must figure out how to use these most advantageously in order to survive in the dungeon. ''[[USGamer]]'' further considers &quot;stamina decay&quot; as another feature related to resource management. The player's character constantly needs to find food to survive or will die from hunger, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns for a long period of time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgamer guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-gateway-guide-to-roguelikes|title=The Gateway Guide to Roguelikes|date=April 6, 2015|work=[[USGamer]]|author=Jeremy Parish|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich Carlson, one of the creators of an early roguelike-like ''[[Strange Adventures in Infinite Space]]'', called this aspect a sort of &quot;clock&quot;, imposing some type of deadline or limitation on how much the player can explore and creating tension in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitaleel interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnHarris/20160321/268520/Play_85_A_Talk_with_Digital_Eel_Makers_of_the_Infinite_Space_Games.php | title = @Play 85: A Talk with Digital Eel, Makers of the Infinite Space Games | first = John | last = Harris | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = March 22, 2016 | accessdate = March 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The game is focused on [[hack and slash]]-based gameplay, where the goal is to kill many monsters, and where other peaceful options do not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game requires the player to explore the map and discover the purpose of unidentified items in a manner that resets every playthrough. The identity of [[Magic (gaming)|magical]] items, including magically enchanted items, varies from run to run. Newly discovered objects only offer a vague physical description that is randomized between games, with purposes and capabilities left unstated. For example, a &quot;bubbly&quot; potion might heal wounds one game, then poison the player character in the next. Items are often subject to alteration, acquiring specific traits, such as a curse, or direct player modification.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;

Low-value factors from the Berlin Interpretation are:&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game is based on controlling only a single character throughout one playthrough.
* Monsters have behavior that is similar to the player-character, such as the ability to pick up items and use them, or cast spells.
* The game aimed to provide a tactical challenge that may require players to play through several times to learn the appropriate tactics for survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game is presented using [[ASCII]] characters in a [[Tile-based video game|tile-based]] map.
* The game involves exploring dungeons which are made up of rooms and interconnecting corridors. Some games may have open areas or natural features, such as rivers, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gsw berlin&quot;/&gt;
* The game presents the status of the player and the game through numbers on the game's screen/interface.

Though not addressed by the Berlin Interpretation, roguelikes are generally single-player games. On [[multi-user]] systems, [[High score|leaderboards]] are often shared between players. Some roguelikes allow traces of former player characters to appear in later game sessions in the form of [[ghost]]s or [[Headstone|grave markings]]. Some games such as NetHack even have the player's former characters reappear as enemies within the dungeon. Multi-player turn-based derivatives such as ''[[TomeNET]]'', ''MAngband'', and ''[[Crossfire (computer game)|Crossfire]]'' do exist and are playable [[On-line and off-line|online]].&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock bonus 7day&quot;&gt;Craddock 2015, Bonus Round: &quot;Excerpt from One Week Dungeons: Diaries of a Seven-Day Roguelike Challenge&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early roguelikes===
[[File:NetHack 3.4.3 ASCII capture ecran.png|thumb|right|A level in ''NetHack'' in ASCII mode]]
Early roguelikes were developed to be played on [[text-based user interface]]s, commonly UNIX-based computer mainframes and terminals used at colleges and universities before transitioning to personal computers. Games used a mix of [[ASCII]] or [[ANSI escape codes|ANSI]] characters to visually represent elements of the dungeon levels, creatures, and items on the level as in [[ASCII art]]. These games typically included one or two text lines presenting the player's current status at the bottom of the screen, and text-based menu screens to manage inventory, statistics, and other details.

The player's character was nearly always represented by the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; character across text-based roguelikes, which had been chosen by the developers of ''Rogue'' to stand for &quot;where you're at&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock chp2&quot;/&gt; Other common examples would include &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; for monetary treasure and &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; for a dragon. Later games would take advantage of colour-based text graphics to increase the variation of creature types, such as a red &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; for a red dragon that would shoot fire, while a green &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; could indicate a green dragon that would shoot acid. Players would use the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], using one keypress to enter a [[command (computing)|command]]. Sociologist Mark R. Johnson described these commonality of symbols and glyphs as [[Code (semiotics)|semiotic codes]] that gave an &quot;aesthetic construction of nostalgia&quot; by &quot;depicting textual symbols as aesthetic forms in their own right&quot; and consistency across multiple roguelikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Games and Culture]] | first = Mark R. | last = Johnson | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/1555412015585884 | pages = 115–135 | title = The Use of ASCII Graphics in Roguelikes: Aesthetic Nostalgia and Semiotic Difference | date = 2017 | s2cid = 64436113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With modern computer systems, users developed alternate means of displaying the game, such as graphical tilesets and [[Isometric projection|Isometric]]-based graphical front ends, as well as interfaces that took advantage of keyboard and mouse UI controls, but otherwise still kept to the core tile-based gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/06/26/control-dwarf-fortress-with-isometric-graphics-and-mouse/ | title =  Control Dwarf Fortress With Isometric Graphics And Mouse | date = June 26, 2014 | accessdate = May 4, 2015 | first = Graham | last = Smith | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As computers offered more advanced user interfaces, such as [[windows (computing)|windows]] and point-and-click [[Menu (computing)|menus]], many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful to not only show the character-based dungeon, but details on the character's inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands. More recent examples of roguelikes that have stayed with ASCII art-based displays include ''[[Cogmind]]'' (2017) and ''[[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name=&quot;ks ascii art&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://killscreen.com/previously/articles/cogmind-proves-roguelike-isnt-done-ascii-art-yet/ | title = Roguelikes Aren't Done With ASCII Art Yet | first = Christian | last = Valentin | date = October 17, 2016 | accessdate = January 4, 2020 | work = [[Kill Screen]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rogue-lites and procedural death labyrinths===
[[File:Abyss Odyssey - Screenshot 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Abyss Odyssey]]'' combines roguelike elements with [[beat 'em up]] gameplay]]
With computers and video game consoles capable of more advanced graphics and gameplay, numerous games have emerged that are loosely based on the classic roguelike design but diverge in one or more features. Many of these games use the concepts of procedurally generated maps and permadeath, while moving away from tile-based movement and turn-based gameplay, often using another gameplay genre such as [[action game]]s or [[platform game|platformers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/review-risk-of-rain-265467.phtml | title = Cloudy with a chance of being eviscerated | first = Darren  |last = Nakamura | date = November 14, 2013 | accessdate = November 18, 2013 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://za.ign.com/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth/97192/feature/the-evolution-of-the-roguelike | title = The Evolution of the Roguelike | first = Jack | last = Forde | date = January 21, 2016 | accessdate = January 22, 2016 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles deriving from roguelike games are based on the observation that the traditional roguelikes are difficult with a steep [[learning curve]], and a player may never complete these games over numerous play sessions, making these titles difficult to sell to a broader audience. These new games would include elements to reduce the difficulty as to draw in a larger audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee insight&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insight.ieeeusa.org/insight/content/views/371703 | title = Going Rogue: A Brief History of the Computerized Dungeon Crawl | first = Nathan | last = Brewer | date = July 7, 2016 | accessdate = September 15, 2016 | work = Insights | publisher = [[IEEE]] USA | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919020229/http://insight.ieeeusa.org/insight/content/views/371703 | archivedate = September 19, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many games with some of the Berlin Interpretation elements call themselves &quot;roguelike&quot;, but bear little resemblance to the original ''Rogue'', causing confusion and dilution of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/14/what-is-a-roguelike/ | title = Roguelike, Roguelikelike, Roguelikelikelike, Or Rogue? | first = Alice | last =O'Conner | date = September 14, 2016 | accessdate = September 14, 2016 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the term &quot;rogue-lite&quot; or &quot;roguelike-like&quot; has been used to distinguish these games that possess some, but not all, of the Berlin Interpretation features from those that exactly meet the Berlin roguelike definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/what-the-hell-is-a-roguelike-we-try-to-hash-out-a-definition | title = What the hell is a roguelike?

Roguelike-likes are generally much shorter games intended to be winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many rogue-lites feature a [[metagaming|metagame]], whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features such as the ability to select a new character at the start of the game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/before-spelunky-and-ftl-there-was-only-ascii.html | title = Before Spelunky and FTL, There Was Only ASCII | first=  Mark |  last = Johnson | date = July 22, 2015 | accessdate = July 31, 2015 | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several rogue-lites feature daily challenges, in which a preset [[random seed]] is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/more-games-need-daily-challenge-modes-1740109783 | title = More Games Need Daily Challenge Modes | first = Patrick | last = Klepeck | date = November 2, 2015 | accessdate = November 4, 2015 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogue-lites may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.

''US Gamer'' further identified games they consider [[edge case]]s of being roguelikes or rogue-lites, as they are inspired by ''Rogue'', and &quot;that stray a bit further from the genre but still manage to scratch the same itch as a great roguelike&quot;. These include games such as the ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' series, ''[[ToeJam &amp; Earl]]'', and ''[[Dwarf Fortress]]'', the latter which retains the classic ASCII art-approach to gameplay as traditional roguelikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgamer guide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ks ascii art&quot;/&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]'' writer Richard C. Moss alternatively suggested that the term &quot;roguelike&quot; is less necessarily about any specific genre definition but instead the idea that &quot;games can be deep, inventive, challenging, and endlessly compelling experiences through their rules and their systems alone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstech 2020&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of roguelikes}}

===Early history (1975–1980)===
The creation of roguelike games came from hobbyist programmers and [[hack (computing)|computer hackers]], attempting to create games for the nascent computer field in the early 1980s, particularly influenced by the 1975 [[adventure game|text adventure game]] ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (often simply titled ''Adventure''), and from the [[high fantasy]] setting of the tabletop game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. Some elements of the roguelike genre were present in dungeon crawlers written for the [[PLATO system]]. This includes ''[[pedit5]]'' (1975) believed to be the first dungeon crawl game, and featured random monster encounters, though only used a single fixed dungeon level.&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee insight&quot;/&gt; ''pedit5'' inspired similar PLATO-based dungeon crawlers ''[[dnd (video game)|dnd]]'' (1975), ''orthanc'' (1978), ''[[Moria (PLATO)|Moria]]'' (1978), and  ''[[Avatar (1979 video game)|avatar]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton 2008 30–37&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMXu61GbTqMC |title=Dungeons &amp; Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2008 |accessdate= December 19, 2015 |isbn = 978-1-56881-411-7 | pages = 30–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee insight&quot;/&gt; It is unclear if these PLATO games inspired the roguelike genre as there is no evidence that the early roguelike creators had access to these games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton 2008 30–37&quot;/&gt; The core roguelike games were developed independently of each other, many of the developers not learning about their respective projects until several years after the genre took off.&lt;ref name=&quot;craddock chp4&quot;/&gt;

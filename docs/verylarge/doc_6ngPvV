{{Main|List of Shakespeare plays in quarto}}
Eighteen of the 36 plays in the [[First Folio]] were printed in separate and individual editions prior to 1623. ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' (1609) and ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' (1634) also appeared separately before their inclusions in folio collections (the Shakespeare Third Folio and the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and  Fletcher folio]], respectively). All of these were [[book size|quarto]] editions, with two exceptions: ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'', the first edition of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', was printed in [[book size|octavo]] form in 1595, as was the 1611 edition of ''The most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus''.&lt;ref&gt;The identification of the 1611 edition of Titus Andronicus as an octavo rather than, as had previously been assumed, as a quarto is confirmed by [[chain line]] and [[watermark]] evidence, as well as by the dimensions of the leaves. The Houghton Library copy of this text (STC 22330) has vertical chain lines and watermarks in the upper inner margin, just as one would expect to find in an octavo. So too the Folger Shakespeare Library copy (see catalogue description at http://hamnet.folger.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=163950 ). The leaf dimensions of the Houghton copy are 12 cm. x 18 cm.; the result is a longer, more traditional octavo leaf rather than the more distinctively squarish shape one finds in quartos, whose chain lines are almost always oriented horizontally and whose watermarks are usually found in the middle of the gutter.&lt;/ref&gt; In chronological order, these publications were:

*''[[Titus Andronicus]],'' 1594, 1600, 1611 (octavo)
*''[[Henry VI, Part 2]],'' 1594, 1600, 1619
*''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' 1595 (octavo), 1600, 1619
*''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]],'' 1596
*''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' 1597, 1599, 1609
*''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]],'' 1597, 1598, 1608, 1615
*''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],'' 1597, 1598, 1602, 1605, 1612, 1622
*''[[Love's Labour's Lost]],'' 1598
*''[[Henry IV, Part 1]],'' 1598, 1599, 1604, 1608, 1613, 1622
*''[[Henry IV, Part 2]],'' 1600
*''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' 1600, 1602, 1619
*''[[The Merchant of Venice]],'' 1600, 1619
*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]],'' 1600, 1619
*''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' 1600
*''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]],'' 1602, 1619
*''[[Hamlet]],'' 1603, 1604, 1611
*''[[King Lear]],'' 1608, 1619
*''[[Troilus and Cressida]],'' 1609
*''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]],'' 1609, 1611, 1619
*''[[Othello]],'' 1622
*''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]],'' 1634.

Six of the preceding were classified as &quot;[[bad quarto]]s&quot; by [[Alfred W. Pollard]] and other scholars associated with the [[New Bibliography]]. Popular plays like ''1 Henry IV''  and ''Pericles'' were reprinted in their quarto editions even after the First Folio appeared, sometimes more than once.

== Poetry ==

Shakespeare's poems were also printed in quarto or octavo form:
*''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]],'' Q1—1593, Q2—1594 (with later editions in octavo);
*''[[The Rape of Lucrece]],'' Q—1594 (with later editions in octavo);
*''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]],'' Q1—1601, Q2—1611 (in Robert Chester's ''Love's Martyr'');
*''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|The Sonnets]]'' and ''[[A Lover's Complaint]],'' Q—1609.

Differing from the quartos of the plays, the first editions of Shakespeare's narrative poems are extremely well printed. &quot;[[Richard Field (publisher)|Richard Field]], Shakespeare's first publisher and printer, was a Stratford man, probably a friend of Shakespeare, and the two produced an excellent text.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare may have had direct involvement in the publication of the two poems, as [[Ben Jonson]] exercised in reference to the publication of his works, but as Shakespeare clearly did not do in connection with his plays.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] published a collected edition of Shakespeare's ''Poems'' in 1640; the poems were not added to collections of the plays until the 18th century. (The disputed miscellany ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' was only printed in octavo: twice in 1599, with another in 1612, all by William Jaggard.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaggard|first=Wm|date=1934-05-19|title=William Jaggard and The 'Passionate Pilgrim.'|url=https://academic.oup.com/nq/article/CLXVI/may19/353/4208836|journal=Notes and Queries|language=en|volume=CLXVI|issue=may19|pages=353–354|doi=10.1093/nq/CLXVI.may19.353d|issn=0029-3970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folios==
[[File:Third folio.JPG|thumb|The additional plays section in the 1664 second impression of the Third Folio.]]
{{Seealso|First Folio|Second Folio}}
The folio format was reserved for expensive, prestigious volumes. During Shakespeare's lifetime, stage plays were not generally taken seriously as literature and not considered worthy of being collected into folios, so the plays printed while he was alive were printed as quartos. His poems were never included in his collected works until the eighteenth century.

It was not until 1616, the year of Shakespeare's death, that [[Ben Jonson]] defied convention by issuing a folio collection of his own plays and poems.  Seven years later the folio volume ''Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies'' appeared; this edition is now called the [[First Folio]]. It contains 36 plays, 18 of which were printed for the first time. Because Shakespeare was dead, the folio was compiled by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]] (fellow actors in Shakespeare's company), and arranged into comedies, histories and tragedies.  The First Folio is generally looked to by actors and directors as the purest form of Shakespeare's text. While punctuation and grammar aren't always accurate by today's rules, these things served as direction to the actors on how to say the lines.

'''The First Folio''' was compiled by Heminges and Condell — but it was published by a trio of stationers (booksellers and publishers): [[William Jaggard]], his son Isaac Jaggard, and [[Edward Blount]]. ([[William Aspley]] and [[John Smethwick]] participated in the endeavor as subsidiary partners.) It contained, in addition to blandishments provided by various admirers of Shakespeare, such as the dedication signed by &quot;John Heminge and Henry Condell&quot;, 36 plays (including ''Troilus and Cressida'', which was not, however, listed in the table of contents, but omitting ''Pericles'' and ''The Two Noble Kinsmen'', which are now usually considered canonical).&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomas Lowndes]], ''The Biographer's Manual of English Literature## (London, rev. ed. by Henry G. Bohn, 1890) vol. 8, pages 2253-2255.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaggards were printers, and did the actual printing of the book. The elder Jaggard has seemed an odd choice to many commentators, given his problematical relationship with the Shakespeare canon: Jaggard issued the suspect collection ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' in 1599 and 1612, and in 1619 printed the so-called [[False Folio]], ten pirated or spurious Shakespearean plays, some with false dates and title pages. It is thought that the printing of the First Folio was such an enormous task that the Jaggards' shop was simply needed to get the job done. (William Jaggard was old, infirm, and blind by 1623, and in fact died a month before the First Folio was complete.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 169–71, 249–50, 355–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Folio was reprinted three times in the 17th century:

'''The [[Second Folio]]''' appeared in 1632. Isaac Jaggard had died in 1627, and Edward Blount had transferred his rights to stationer [[Robert Allot]] in 1630. The Second Folio was published by Allot, William Aspley, [[Richard Hawkins (publisher)|Richard Hawkins]], [[Richard Meighen]], and John Smethwick, and printed by [[Thomas Cotes]]. It contained the same plays as the First Folio and much of the same additional material, with the addition of an unsigned poem by John Milton.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomas Lowndes]], ''The Biographer's Manual of English Literature'' (London, rev. ed. by Henry G. Bohn, 1890) vol. 8, pages 2256-2257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''The Third Folio''' was issued in 1663, published by [[Philip Chetwinde]]; Chetwinde had married Robert Allot's widow and so obtained the rights to the book. To the second impression of the Third Folio (1664) he added seven plays, namely ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]];''  ''[[Locrine]];'' ''[[The London Prodigal]];'' ''[[The Puritan]];'' ''[[Sir John Oldcastle]];'' ''[[Thomas Lord Cromwell]];'' and ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]].'' (See: [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]].) All seven of these additional plays had been published as quartos while Shakespeare was alive, but only ''Pericles'' was eventually widely accepted into the Shakespearean canon.&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Allan Neilson &amp; Ashley Horance Thorndike, ''The Facts About Shakespeare'' (NY, Macmillan, rev. ed. 1931) pages 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The quartos of ''Pericles'' (1609 and 1611), ''The London Prodigal'' (1605) and ''A Yorkshire Tragedy'' (1608) were all attributed to William Shakespeare on their front pages. The quartos of ''Locrine'' (1595), ''The Puritan'' (1607) and ''Thomas Lord Cromwell'' (1602 and 1613) were attributed to W. S. on their title pages, but Shakespeare was not the only playwright with those initials; [[Wentworth Smith]] has been put forward as another possible author of these works. ''Sir John Oldcastle'' was printed in 1619, three years after Shakespeare's death, as part of the False Folio. It was attributed to Shakespeare on its title page which also bore a false date of 1600.

The Third Folio is relatively rare, compared to the Second and Fourth, probably because unsold copies were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. One surviving copy was purchased by the Irish High Court judge and antiquarian [[William O'Brien (judge)|William O'Brien]] in the 1880s. It was put up for auction by [[Sotheby's]]  in 2017.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

'''The Fourth Folio''' appeared in 1685, published by R. Bentley, E. Brewster, R. Chiswell, and [[Henry Herringman|H. Herringman]]. It contains the same 43 plays as the Third Folio. (Brewster, Chiswell, and Herringman were members of the six-man syndicate that published the [[Ben Jonson folios|third Ben Jonson folio]] in 1692; Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] in 1679.)

The Fourth Folio in turn served as the base for the series of eighteenth-century editions of Shakespeare's plays. [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] used the Fourth Folio text as the foundation of his [[1709 in literature|1709]] edition, and subsequent editors — [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Lewis Theobald|Theobald]], etc. — both adapted and reacted to Rowe's text in their own editions. (See: [[Shakespeare's editors]].)

''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' did not appear in any Folio edition, was not printed until 1634, although there is evidence of its being performed much earlier.  The title page said &quot;written by the memorable worthies of their time: Mr. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and Mr. William Shakspeare [''sic''], Gent.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomas Lowndes]], ''The Biographer's Manual of English Literature'' (London, rev. ed. by Henry G. Bohn, 1890) vol. 8, page 2304.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not included in most editions of Shakespeare (e.g., the Cambridge/Globe editions of Wright and Clark, ca. 1863) until the latter half of the 19th century (it appears, e.g., in Dyce's collected Works of Shakespeare in 1876) but it was not generally accepted into the Shakespeare canon until well into the 20th century, when, for example, it was included in the Riverside edition of 1974.

The '''evil clown''' is a subversion of the traditional comic [[clown]] character, in which the playful trope is instead rendered as disturbing through the use of [[Horror and terror|horror]] elements and [[dark humor]]. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by [[DC Comics]] character [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] starting in 1940 and again by [[It (character)|Pennywise]] in [[Stephen King]]'s 1986 novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]''. The character can be seen as playing on the sense of unease felt by sufferers of '''coulrophobia''', the [[phobia|fear]] of clowns.

==Origins==
[[File:Enrico Caruso As Canio.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Enrico Caruso]] as the murderous Canio in ''[[Pagliacci]]'']]
The modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s &quot;[[Hop-Frog]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;hopfrog&quot;&gt;[[s:Hop-Frog|Poe, Edgar Allan, ''&quot;Hop-Frog&quot;'' (1849)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the [[University of Missouri-Rolla]], to draw upon an [[Bal des Ardents|earlier incident]] &quot;at a masquerade ball&quot;, in the 14th century, during which &quot;the King and his frivolous party, costumed—in highly flammable materials—as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Jack|title=The biology of horror: gothic literature and film|year=2002|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|isbn=978-0809324712|pages=41–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yk-0SmCIZ_kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil clowns also occupied a small niche in drama, appearing in the 1874 work ''La femme de Tabarin'' by Catulle Mendès and in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (accused of being a plagiarism of Mendès' piece), both works featuring murderous clowns as central characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendès|first=Catulle|title=La femme de Tabarin: Tragi-parade|year=1904|publisher=Librairie Charpentier et Fasquelle |pages=1–34|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_femme_de_Tabarin.html?id=pUcESQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryden|first=Konrad|title=Leoncavallo: Life and Works|year=2007|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=978-0-8108-5880-0|url=https://archive.org/details/leoncavallo00domi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' published a series of mock comic books in the pages of the magazine, entitled &quot;Evil Clown&quot;, which featured a malevolent titular character named [[Frenchy the Clown]]. During that decade, American [[serial killer]] and [[rape|rapist]] [[John Wayne Gacy]] became known as the ''Killer Clown'' when arrested in 1978, after it was discovered he had performed as Pogo the Clown at children's parties and other events; however, Gacy did not actually commit his crimes while wearing his clown costume.&lt;ref name=&quot;gacy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry |last=Sullivan |first2=Peter T. |last2=Maiken |title=Killer Clown: The John Wayne Gacy Murders| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pyrotechnic_Insanitarium.html?id=u71s2gNZqJoC | publisher=[[Kensington Books#Imprints|Pinnacle]] | location=[[New York City]] | year=2000 | isbn= 0-7860-1422-9| oclc = 156783287}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Evil clown themes were occasionally found in popular music. [[Zal Cleminson]], guitarist with the English [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], wore black and white clown-style makeup and colorful clothes while on stage during the band's 1970s heyday, while his &quot;happy-sad-happy&quot; demeanor helped give their performances an edge of menace.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Kitts and Nick Baxter-Moore (eds.) The Routledge Companion to Popular Music and Humor, Chapter 6. 2019, Routledge {{ISBN|9781351266628}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pennywise Cosplay 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cosplay]] of the Stephen King character [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown]], a famous evil clown]]

The modern stock character of the evil clown was popularized by [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', published in 1986, which introduced the fear of an evil clown to a modern audience. In the novel, the [[It (character)|eponymous character]] is a pan-dimensional monster which feeds mainly on children by luring them in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and then assuming the shape of whatever the victim fears the most.

The evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike it caused to inherent elements of coulrophobia; however, it has been suggested by Joseph Durwin&lt;ref name=&quot;trickster&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| id=Article 4| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that the concept of evil clowns has an independent position in popular culture, arguing that &quot;the concept of evil clowns and the widespread hostility it induces is a cultural phenomenon which transcends just the phobia alone&quot;. A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded &quot;that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Why scary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because of the nature of clowns' makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at [[California State University, Northridge]] stated, young children are &quot;very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;trinity&quot;/&gt; This natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character.

Researcher [[Ben Radford]], who published ''Bad Clowns''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bad Clowns&quot;/&gt; in 2016 and is regarded as an expert on the phenomenon,&lt;ref name=&quot;kob4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shone|first1=Colton|title=Recent scary clown trend nothing new, expert said|url=http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/recent-scary-clown-trend-nothing-new-expert-benjamin-radford-bad-clowns-author-book-creepy/4291893/?cat=500|website=KOB 4|accessdate=20 October 2016|authorlink=Ben Radford|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018190315/http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/recent-scary-clown-trend-nothing-new-expert-benjamin-radford-bad-clowns-author-book-creepy/4291893/?cat=500|archivedate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that looking throughout history clowns are seen as tricksters, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book ''Bad Clowns'', Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown (or evil-clown) persona. They see them as &quot;the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them,&quot; and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: [[Harlequin]], the King's fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the &quot;ability to change with the times&quot; and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the &quot;truth&quot; much like the court jester and &quot;dip clowns&quot; do using &quot;human foibles&quot; against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the &quot;good clowns&quot; outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are &quot;the exception, not the rule.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bad Clowns&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Bad Clowns|date=2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Scary clown.jpg|thumb|&quot;Evil clown&quot; makeup and costume]]
The concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as '''coulrophobia''', a [[neologism]] coined in the context of informal &quot;[[List of phobias|''-phobia'' lists]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The term is listed by the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' ({{OEtymD|coulrophobia}}) with the caveat that it &quot;looks suspiciously like the sort of thing idle pseudo-intellectuals invent on the Internet and which every smarty-pants takes up thereafter&quot;. The prefix ''coulro-'' is &quot;said to be built from Greek ''kolon'' 'limb,' with some supposed sense of 'stilt-walker,' hence 'clown'&quot; (i.e. Greek {{lang|grc|κωλοβαθριστής}} ''kolobathristes'' &quot;stilt-walker&quot;).
Probably coined no earlier than the late 1980s but no later than the 1990s, the term  &quot;has been coined more on the Internet than in printed form because it does not appear in any previously published, psychiatric, unabridged, or abridged dictionary.&quot;   (Robertson 2003:62)
The ''Oxford Dictionary of English'' adopted the term in 2010, also deriving it from ''kolobatheron'' &quot;stilt&quot; ({{citation|editor-last=Stevenson |editor-first=Angus |contribution=coulrophobia noun |title=Oxford Dictionary of English |year=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t140.e0183900 |format={{ODNBsub}} |accessdate=14 March 2011}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] has theorized the [[postmodern]] [[archetype]] of the evil clown in &quot;Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns&quot; (a chapter in his cultural critique ''The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink'').&lt;ref name=&quot;insanitarium&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Dery | title=The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802136701 |url-access=registration | publisher=[[Grove Press]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=1999 | isbn= 0-8021-3670-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across [[popular culture]], Dery analyzes the &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; persona of the [[serial killer]] [[John Wayne Gacy]]; the obscene clowns of the neo-[[Situationist International|situationist]] [[Cacophony Society]]; the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (of ''[[Batman]]'' fame); the grotesque art of R.K.

Using [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theory of the carnivalesque, [[Analytical Psychology|Jungian]] and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the [[Information Age]], Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous [[psychopath]]s at many American [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]].

Wolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown's appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting &quot;[the clown's] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlarged

Later sightings included Chicago, Illinois, in 2008.&lt;ref name=media/&gt; Explanations for the phenomenon have ranged from [[Stephen King]]'s book ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' and the crimes of serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]],&lt;ref name=eul/&gt; to a [[moral panic]] influenced by contemporaneous fears of [[Satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref name=media/&gt; It also shows similarities to the story of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt; In most cases the reports were made by children, and no adults or police officers were able to confirm the sightings.&lt;ref name=media/&gt;

In 2013, a character who became known as &quot;the [[Northampton]] Clown&quot; was repeatedly sighted standing silently around the English town.

In 2014, &quot;the [[Wasco, California|Wasco]] clown&quot; attracted social media attention in California.

==Response to evil clowns in media==
In 2014, [[Clowns of America International]] responded to the depiction of Twisty on ''[[American Horror Story]]'', and evil clowns in media generally. President Glenn Kohlberger said, &quot;Hollywood makes money sensationalizing the norm. They can take any situation no matter how good or pure and turn it into a nightmare. ... We do not support in any way, shape or form any medium that sensationalizes or adds to [[coulrophobia]] or 'clown fear.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/professional-clown-club-attacks-american-740768 |title=Professional Clown Club Attacks 'American Horror Story' Over Murderous Character |last=Abramovitch |first=Sam |date=15 October 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary &quot;evil clown&quot; archetype developed in the 1980s, notably popularized by [[Stephen King]]'s [[It (novel)|''It'']], and perhaps influenced by [[John Wayne Gacy]], a serial killer dubbed the ''Killer Clown'' in 1978. ''[[Killer Klowns from Outer Space]]'' is a 1988 horror comedy dedicated to the topic. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] character in the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' franchise was introduced in 1940 and has developed into one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, leading ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Villains of All Time&quot; ranking in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=&lt;!--Staff--&gt; |date=July 2006 |title=Top 100 Greatest Villains |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |volume=1 |issue= 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Krusty the Clown]], a cartoon character introduced 1989 in the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', is a comical, non-scary clown, the character reveals darker aspects in his personality. In ''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Lisa's First Word]]&quot; (1992), children's fear of clowns features in the form of a very young Bart being traumatized by an inexpertly-built Krusty the Clown themed bed, repeatedly uttering the phrase &quot;can't sleep, clown will eat me....&quot; The phrase inspired an [[Alice Cooper]] song in the album   ''[[Dragontown]]'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00059,117508302B023D18.html |title=Some pop culture creations demonize the red-nosed men |accessdate=19 January 2008 |date=15 February 2007 |work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a popular catchphrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7191721.stm |title=Why are clowns scary? |first=Finlo |last=Rohrer |accessdate= 19 January 2008 |date=16 January 2008 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American rap duo [[Insane Clown Posse]] have exploited this theme since 1989 and have inspired [[Twiztid]] and similar acts, many on [[Psychopathic Records]], to do likewise.

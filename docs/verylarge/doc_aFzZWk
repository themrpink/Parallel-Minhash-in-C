After suffering a decline during the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], the city resumed its growth in the late 1920s, with the expansion of various industries, iron ore and metallurgy in particular, and by 1939 its population had reached 104,500.

===Kerch in World War II===
[[File:Керчь. Обелиск Славы на вершине горы Митридат..jpg|thumb|right|250px]]

On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]] from 1941 to 1945, Kerch was the site of heavy fighting between [[Red Army]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces.
After fierce fighting, the city was taken by the [[Germany|Germans]] in November 1941. On 31 December 1941 the [[302nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|302nd Mountain Rifle Division]] recaptured the city following a naval landing operation at Kamysh Burun, to the south of the city, five days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forczyk|first=Robert|title=Where the Iron Crosses Grow|publisher=Osprey Publishing|place=Oxford, UK|year=2014|pages=103, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 the Germans occupied the city again. The Red Army lost over 160,000 men, either killed or taken [[POW]] at the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula (1942)|Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]]. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing operation was launched. Kerch returned to Soviet control on 11 April 1944.

The German invaders killed about 15,000 citizens and deported another 14,000 during their occupation.
Evidence of German atrocities in Kerch was presented in the [[Nuremberg trials]]. After the war, the city was awarded the title [[Hero City]].

The [[Defense of the Adzhimushkay quarry|Adzhimushkay]] [[catacombs]] (mines) in the city's suburbs were the site of [[guerrilla warfare]] against the occupation. Thousands of soldiers and refugees found shelter inside, and were involved in counterattacks. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous alleged poison gas attacks. Later, a memorial was established on the site.

On 11 November 2007 there was a great storm that passed through the city, causing much damage and an ecological disaster as a few ships, including an oil tanker, were shipwrecked and blocked the [[Kerch Strait]].

===Recent events===
On 17 October 2018, [[Kerch Polytechnic College massacre|a student killed 20 people]] and himself at [[Kerch Polytechnic College]].

The city municipality stretches over a substantial area and includes several separate neighborhoods that are part of the Kerch city: Eltigen (Heroyevskoe), Kamysh-Burun (Arshyntsevo), [[Port Krym]], Adzhimushkai, and [[Tuzla Island]].

==Economy==
Today Kerch is considered as a city of [[metallurgist]]s, shipbuilders and fishermen, and also has a significant tourism sector.

===Industry===
The largest enterprises in the city are:
* Kerch Metallurgical Works Factory launched in 1900
* Kamysh-Burun Iron Ore Plant
* &quot;Zaliv&quot; (&quot;Gulf&quot;) shipbuilding factory that produces and repairs tankers and cargo ships.
Construction-materials, food processing, and light industries play a significant role in the city's economy. Kerch is also a fishing fleet base and an important processing centre for numerous fish products.

[[File:Kerch MithridatesStair.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mithridates Staircase (19th century)]]
Because of its location on the shores of the [[Sea of Azov|Azov]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, Kerch became a popular summer resort among people of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Also, several mud-cure sources are located near the city. Despite the seaside location, the tourist appeal of Kerch today is limited because of the industrial character of the city and associated pollution.
Despite the lack of beaches in the town's area, there are a lot of them at a distance of 20 minutes' travel by bus, train or taxi.

Kerch has a number of impressive architectural and historical monuments. Ancient historical heritage of the city makes it attractive for scientific tourism. The most notable of Kerch's sights are:
*Site of ancient settlement Pantikapaeum (5th century BC–3rd century AD).
*[[Royal Kurgan (Kerch)|Tsarskiy Kurghan]] (4th century BC) – burial mound for one of the Bosporian kings
*Church of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] (AD 717)
*[[Yenikale|Fortress of Yenikale]] (18th century)
*The Great Mithridates Staircase leading on top of the [[Mount Mithridat]], contains 428 footsteps, built in 1833–1840 under the guidance of [[Italy|Italian]] architect [[Alexander Digbi]]
*Obelisk of Glory on the [[Mount Mithridat]], built after World War II
*[[Lapidarium, Kerch|Lapidarium]]
*Memorial of heroic [[Defense of the Adzhimushkay quarry|guerilla warfare in Adzhimushkay mines]]
*[[Kerch (fortress)|Kerch Fortress]]; restricted area in Soviet times but free to enter in present days. The fortress was built by the Russian military architect [[Eduard Totleben|Totleben]] in the middle of 19th century.
* Sites of ancient settlements Mirmecium, Tiritaka and Nimphei. There are also some settlements which have gone underwater due to earthquakes.
* So called [[Demeter|Demetra]]'s Crypt, a crypt with numerous frescos dated 1st century BC.

===Transport===
[[File:Kerch Housing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Private houses are common in Kerch]]
Kerch has a harbour on the Kerch Strait, which makes it a key to the [[Sea of Azov]], several railroad terminals and a small airport. The [[Kerch Strait ferry line]] across the [[Kerch Strait]] was established in 1953, connecting Crimea and the [[Krasnodar Krai]] ([[Port Krym]] – [[Port Kavkaz]] line); (as of November 2009) there are also plans for a Kerch-[[Poti]] ferry route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53185/ |title=Yushchenko says Ukraine to try quickly implement Kerch-Poti ferry route project|agency= Interfax-Ukraine|via=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liane Gabora''' is a professor of [[psychology]] at the [[UBC Okanagan|University of British Columbia - Okanagan]]. She is best known for her theory of the &quot;Origin of the modern mind through conceptual closure,&quot; which built on her earlier work on &quot;Autocatalytic closure in a cognitive system: A tentative scenario for the origin of culture.&quot; Her recent writing on Honing Theory is adding new direction to the considerable work published on theories of creativity.

==Career==
&lt;!--:''a discussion of her &quot;conceptual closure&quot; theory should go here''--&gt;
Gabora has contributed to the study of [[cultural evolution]] and [[evolution of societies]], focusing strongly on the role of personal creativity, as opposed to [[memetic]] imitation or instruction, in differentiating modern human from prior [[Hominidae|hominid]] or modern [[ape culture]]. In particular, she seems to follow [[feminist economists]] and [[green economists]] in making a very strong, indeed pivotal, distinction between creative &quot;enterprise&quot;, invention, art or &quot;[[individual capital]]&quot; and imitative &quot;[[meme]]&quot;, rule, social category or &quot;[[instructional capital]]&quot;.

Gabora's views contrasts with that of [[memetics]] and of the strongest [[social capital]] theorists (e.g. [[Karl Marx]] or [[Paul Adler]]) in that she seems to see, as do theorists of [[intellectual capital]], social signals or labels as markers of trust already invested in individual and instructional complexes - rather than as first class actors in themselves.  She puts special emphasis on quantifiable archaeological data, such as the number of different arrow points styles, than on contemporary observations to minimize [[cultural bias]] and notational bias.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Some of her more recent work raises extremely controversial themes in [[philosophy of science]] and strongly challenges the [[particle physics foundation ontology]] (e.g. studying the &quot;violation of Bell inequalities in the macroworld&quot;). She is also known for her contributions to the [[subtle technology]] field.

&quot;Honing Theory: A Complex Systems Framework for Creativity&quot; is her latest publication, which suggests that culture evolves through social interaction and exchange between minds that self-organise and modify based on their environment. Creativity arises due to the possibility of uncertainty and disorder, resulting in arousal and a process of novelty and originality until the arousal dissipates. This in turn feeds the cultural norm which in turn feeds further creativity resulting in part the evolution of culture.

'''British Sign Language'''  ('''BSL''') is a [[sign language]] used in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), and is the first or preferred language of some [[deaf]] people in the UK. There are 125,000&lt;ref&gt;IPSOS Mori GP Patient Survey 2009/10&lt;/ref&gt; deaf adults in the UK who use BSL, plus an estimated 20,000 children. In 2011, 15,000 people living in England and Wales reported themselves using BSL as their main language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_297002.pdf 2011 Census: Quick Statistics for England and Wales, March 2011], Accessed 17 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The language makes use of space and involves movement of the hands, body, face, and head. Many thousands of people who are not deaf also use BSL, as hearing relatives of deaf people, sign language interpreters or as a result of other contact with the British deaf community.

==History==
{{BANZSL family tree}}
History records the existence of a sign language within deaf communities in England as far back as 1570. British Sign Language has evolved, as all languages do, from these origins by modification, invention and importation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/news/reportsandpublications/magazine/magazinearchive/SPAArchive/SPAJune06/Feature6June06.htm Deaf people and linguistic research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000057/http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/ReportsandPublications/Magazine/MagazineArchive/SPAArchive/SPAJune06/Feature6June06.htm |date=2011-06-04 }}, Professor [[Bencie Woll]], Director of the Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre based at University College London. British Science Association. Accessed October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kyle &amp; Woll (1985).''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gcy4MhmLhdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sign+Language:+the+study+of+deaf+people+and+their+language&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Si-uTL2gB5SL4gbT5430Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sign Language: the study of deaf people and their language]'' Cambridge University Press, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Braidwood]], an Edinburgh teacher, founded  'Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb'  in 1760 which is recognised as the first school for the deaf in Britain. His pupils were the sons of the well-to-do. His early use of a form of sign language, ''the combined system'', was the first codification of what was to become British Sign Language. [[Joseph Watson (teacher)|Joseph Watson]] was trained as a teacher of the deaf under Thomas Braidwood and he eventually left in 1792 to become the headmaster of the first public school for the deaf in Britain, the [[Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb]] in [[Bermondsey]].

In 1815, an American Protestant minister, [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], travelled to Europe to research teaching of the deaf. He was rebuffed by both the Braidwood schools who refused to teach him their methods. Gallaudet then travelled to Paris and learned the educational methods of the French Royal Institution for the Deaf, a combination of [[Old French Sign Language]] and the signs developed by [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée|Abbé de l’Épée]]. As a consequence [[American sign language|American Sign Language]] today has a 60% similarity to modern [[French Sign Language]] and is almost unintelligible to users of British Sign Language.

Until the 1940s sign language skills were passed on unofficially between deaf people often living in residential institutions. Signing was actively discouraged in schools by punishment and the emphasis in education was on forcing deaf children to learn to [[lip reading|lip read]] and finger spell. From the 1970s there has been an increasing tolerance and instruction in BSL in schools. The language continues to evolve as older signs such as ''alms'' and ''pawnbroker'' have fallen out of use and new signs such as ''internet'' and ''laser'' have been coined. The evolution of the language and its changing level of acceptance means that older users tend to rely on finger spelling while younger ones make use of a wider range of signs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gcy4MhmLhdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sign+Language:+the+study+of+deaf+people+and+their+language&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Si-uTL2gB5SL4gbT5430Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDsQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sign Language: The Study of Deaf People and Their Language], J.

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2003 the UK government formally recognised that BSL is a language in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/library-rnid/2013/11/13/official-recognition-of-british-sign-language-1987-2003/ |title=Official recognition of British Sign Language 1987-2003 – suggested reading &amp;#124; UCL UCL Ear Institute &amp; Action on Hearing Loss Libraries |publisher=Blogs.ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistics ==
[[Linguistics]] is the study of language, including those like BSL that are not carried by sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Linguistics of British Sign Language|last=Sutton-Spence|first=Rachel|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1999|location=University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all sign languages the great majority of 'words' (hand gestures) cannot be understood in other sign languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot; /&gt; How one language signs a certain number would be different than how another language signs it.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot; /&gt; The way sentences are constructed (syntax) differs from sign language to sign language, just as with different spoken languages. British Sign Language is described as a 'spatial language' as it &quot;moves signs in space.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot; /&gt;&quot;

=== Phonology ===
Like many other [[sign language]]s, BSL [[phonology]] is defined by elements such as handshape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. There are phonological components to sign language that have no meaning alone but work together to create a meaning of a signed word: hand shape, movement, location, orientation and facial expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Gary|date=October 2006|title='Children Are Just Lingual': The Development of Phonology in British Sign Language (BSL).|journal=Lingua|volume=116|issue=10|pages=1507–1523|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2005.07.010|url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/364/2/Children_are_just_lingual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; The meanings of words differ if one of these components is changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; Signs can be identical in certain components but different in others, giving each a different meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;:04&quot;/&gt; Facial expression falls under the 'non-manual features' component of phonology.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McArthur|first=Tom|date=January 2018|title=British Sign Language|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199661282.001.0001/acref-9780199661282-e-1344|journal=The Oxford Companion to the English Language|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199661282.001.0001|isbn=9780199661282}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include &quot;eyebrow height, eye gaze, mouthing, head movement, and torso rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&quot;

The '''Camorra''' ({{IPA-it|kaˈmɔrra|lang}}; {{IPA-nap|kaˈmorrə|lang}}) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Mafia]]-type&lt;ref name=santino&gt;[http://www.centroimpastato.it/otherlang/mafia-in-italy.php3 Mafia and Mafia-type organizations in Italy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194315/http://www.centroimpastato.it/otherlang/mafia-in-italy.php3 |date=29 October 2013 }}, by Umberto Santino, in: Albanese, Das &amp; Verma, ''Organized Crime. World Perspectives'', pp. 82–100&lt;/ref&gt; [[criminal organization]], or [[secret society]], originating in the region of [[Campania]]. It is one of the oldest and largest [[Organized crime in Italy|criminal organizations in Italy]], dating to the 17th century. Unlike the pyramidal structure of the [[Sicilian Mafia]], the Camorra's organizational structure is divided into individual groups also called &quot;''clans''&quot;. Every &quot;''capo''&quot; or &quot;boss&quot;, is the head of a clan, in which there may be tens or hundreds of affiliates, depending on the clan's power and structure. Consequently, as Camorra clans act independently, they are more prone to feuding among themselves. The Camorra's main businesses are [[Drug Trafficking|drug trafficking]], [[racketeering]], [[counterfeiting]] and [[money laundering]]. It is also not unusual for Camorra clans to infiltrate the politics of their respective areas.

Since the early 1980s and its involvement in the drug trafficking business, the Camorra has acquired a strong presence in other European countries, particularly Spain. Usually Camorra clans maintain close contacts with South American drug cartels, which facilitates the arrival of drugs in Europe.

According to Naples public prosecutor Giovanni Melillo, during a 2019 speech of the [[Antimafia Commission]], the most powerful groups of the Camorra in the present day are the [[Mazzarella clan]] and the [[Secondigliano Alliance]]. The latter is an alliance of the [[Licciardi clan|Licciardi]], [[Contini clan|Contini]] and [[Mallardo clan|Mallardo]] clans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The origins of the Camorra are  unclear. It may date to the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;''L'Italia del Seicento'', I. Montanelli R. Gervaso, 1969, Rizzoli Editore, Milano, pag. 193 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0OoJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=camorra+bisca snippet from Google books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330103522/https://books.google.com/books?ei=6KLzTbagLo3GswaitqHOBg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=0OoJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=camorra+bisca |date=30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct Italian descendant of a Spanish secret society, the [[Garduña]], founded in 1417. Officials of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] may have introduced the organisation to the area, or it may have developed gradually from small criminal gangs operating in Neapolitan society near the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=behan9&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent historical research in Spain suggests that the Garduña did not exist and its legendary status was based on a 19th-century fictional book.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.minutodigital.com/noticias2/3387.htm Interview with historian Hipólito Sánchiz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714101915/http://www.minutodigital.com/noticias2/3387.htm |date=14 July 2011 }}, Minuto digital, 11 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official use of ''camorra'' as a word dates from 1735, when a royal decree authorised the establishment of eight gambling houses in Naples. The word is likely a blend, or portmanteau, of ''&quot;[[Caporegime|capo]]&quot;'' (boss) and a Neapolitan street game, the ''&quot;[[morra (game)|morra]]&quot;.''&lt;ref name=&quot;behan9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=morra&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=27 &quot;Il gioco della morra&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910123741/http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=27 |date=10 September 2011 }}, Biblioteca digitale sulla Camorra (accessed 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; After gambling was prohibited by the local government, some people started making the players pay for protection against the attentions of  passing police.&lt;ref name=behan9/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacq23&gt;Jacquemet, ''Credibility in Court'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nar291001&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.narcomafie.it/news_archivio/news_2001_14.htm Camorra, alle radici del male], Narcomafie on line, 29 October 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310042628/http://www.narcomafie.it/news_archivio/news_2001_14.htm |date=10 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camorristi-1906.jpg|left|thumb|''Camorristi'' in Naples, 1906]]
The Camorra emerged during the chaotic power vacuum between 1799 and 1815, when the [[Parthenopean Republic]] was proclaimed on the wave of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. The first official mention of the Camorra as an organisation dates from 1820, when police records detail a disciplinary meeting of the Camorra, a tribunal known as the ''Gran Mamma''. That year the first written statute of the Camorra, the ''frieno'', was discovered, indicating a stable organisational structure in the underworld. Another statute was discovered in 1842, related to initiation rites and funds set aside for the families of those imprisoned. The organisation was also known as the ''Bella Società Riformata'', ''Società dell'Umirtà'' or ''Onorata Società''.&lt;ref name=behan12&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sales72&gt;Sales, ''La camorra, le camorre'', pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution into more organised formations indicated a qualitative change: the Camorra and ''camorristi'' were no longer local gangs living off theft and extortion; they had a fixed structure and some kind of hierarchy. Another qualitative leap was the agreement between the liberal opposition and the Camorra, following the defeat of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848 revolution]].&lt;ref name=fiore190&gt;Fiore, ''Camorra e polizia nella Napoli borbonica (1840-1860)'', pp. 190-195&lt;/ref&gt; The liberals realised that they needed popular support to overthrow the king. They turned to the Camorra and paid them because the ''camorristi'' were the leaders of the city's poor. The new police chief, [[Liborio Romano]], appealed to the head of the Camorra, Salvatore De Crescenzo, to maintain order and appointed him as head of the municipal guard.&lt;ref name=paliotti149&gt;{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', pp. 149–153&lt;/ref&gt; In a few decades, the Camorra had developed into power brokers.&lt;ref name=behan12/&gt; In 1869, [[Ciccio Cappuccio]] was elected as the ''capintesta'' (head-in-chief) of the Camorra by the twelve district heads (''capintriti''), succeeding De Crescenzo after a short interregnum.&lt;ref name=paliotti143&gt;{{in lang|it}} Paliotti, ''Storia della Camorra'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed &quot;The king of Naples&quot; (&quot;o rre 'e Napole&quot;), he died in 1892.&lt;ref name=mat061292&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=27 La morte di Ciccio Cappuccio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408073745/http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=27 |date=8 April 2018 }}, Il Mattino, 6 December 1892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fiore96&gt;{{in lang|it}} Di Fiore, ''Potere camorrista: quattro secoli di malanapoli'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xmxoTqJUkL8C&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Italian unification in 1861, the government made attempts to suppress the Camorra.&lt;ref name=fiore257&gt;Fiore, ''Camorra e polizia nella Napoli borbonica (1840-1860)'', pp. 257-259&lt;/ref&gt; From 1882, it conducted a series of manhunts. The [[Saredo Inquiry]] (1900–1901), established to investigate corruption and bad governance in Naples, identified a system of political patronage run by what the report called the &quot;high Camorra&quot;:
{{quote|The original ''low camorra'' held sway over the poor plebs in an age of abjection and servitude. Then there arose a ''high camorra'' comprising the most cunning and audacious members of the middle class. They fed off trade and public works contracts, political meetings and government bureaucracy. This high camorra strikes deals and does business with the low camorra, swapping promises for favours and favours for promises. The high camorra thinks of the state bureaucracy as being like a field it has to harvest and exploit. Its tools are cunning, nerve and violence. Its strength comes from the streets. And it is rightly considered to be more dangerous, because it has re-established the worst form of despotism by founding a regime based on bullying. The high camorra has replaced free will with impositions, it has nullified individuality and liberty, and it has defrauded the law and public trust.&lt;ref name=machetti&gt;{{in lang|it}} ''[http://www.rivistameridiana.it/files/Machetti,-La-lobby-di-piazza-Municipio.pdf La lobby di piazza Municipio: gli impiegati comunali nella Napoli di fine Ottocento] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619174509/http://www.rivistameridiana.it/files/Machetti,-La-lobby-di-piazza-Municipio.pdf |date=19 June 2018 }}'', by Giulio Machetti, ''Meridiana'', pp. 38–39, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dickie88&gt;Dickie, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7v3UWkI8LEC&amp;pg=PT88 pp. 88–89]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The inquiry introduced the terminology of &quot;high Camorra&quot;, as having a bourgeois character, and distinct from the plebeian Camorra proper. The two groups were in close contact through the figure of the intermediary (''faccendiere'').&lt;ref name=migliaccio&gt;{{in lang|it}} [http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=27 L'Inchiesta Saredo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408073846/http://www.bibliocamorra.altervista.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=27 |date=8 April 2018 }}, by Antonella Migliaccio, Cultura della Legalità e Biblioteca digitale sulla Camorra, Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici dell'Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II (Access date: 5 September 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars dispute whether the &quot;high Camorra&quot; was an integral part of the Camorra proper.&lt;ref name=dickie88/&gt; Although the inquiry did not prove specific collusion between the Camorra and politics, it did reveal the patronage mechanisms that contributed to corruption in the municipality.&lt;ref name=machetti/&gt; The society's influence was weakened, which was exemplified by the defeat of all of their candidates in the 1901 Naples election. In the early 20th century, given the poverty of Naples and the region, many camorristi emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Camorra|title=Camorra – Italian secret society|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=4 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128221933/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Camorra|archive-date=28 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camorra received another blow with the Cuocolo trial (1911–1912). The trial was ostensibly to prosecute those charged with the murder on 6 June 1906 of the Camorrista Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife, who were suspected of being police spies. The main investigator, [[Carabinieri]] Captain Carlo Fabbroni, transformed the trial into one against the Camorra as a whole,  intending to use it to strike the final blow to the Camorra.&lt;ref name=museo&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090808123613/http://www.museocriminologico.it/cuoccolo_uk.htm The Cuocolo trial: the Camorra in the dock], Museo criminologico (Retrieved 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt050311&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/03/05/104820990.pdf Cuocolo Trial May Be Death Blow of the Camorra], ''The New York Times'', 5 March 1911&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trial attracted much attention among newspapers and the general public, both in Italy and the United States, including by [[Pathé News|Pathé's Gazette]].&lt;ref name=dickie191&gt;Dickie, ''Blood Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9TbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 p. 191] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428151732/https://books.google.com/books?id=D9TbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 |date=28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings began in 1911. After 17 months, the often tumultuous proceedings ended with a guilty verdict on 8 July 1912 against defendants who included 27 leading Camorra bosses. They were sentenced to a total of 354 years' imprisonment. [[Enrico Alfano]], the main defendant and nominal head of the Camorra, was sentenced to 30 years.&lt;ref name=museo/&gt;&lt;ref name=behan23&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt090712&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/07/09/104899771.pdf Camorrist Leaders Get 30-Year Terms], ''The New York Times'', 9 July 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tri090712&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%206/New%20York%20NY%20Tribune/New%20York%20NY%20Tribune%201912%20Jul%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Tribune%201912%20Jul%20Grayscale%20-%200159.pdf &quot;Camorra Verdict; All Found Guilty&quot;], ''[[New York Tribune]],'' 9 July 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camorra was never a centralised organisation, but instead a loose confederation of different, independent clans, groups or families. Each group was bound by kinship ties and controlled economic activities that took place in its particular geographic territory. Each took care of its own business, protected its territory, and sometimes tried to expand at another group's expense. There was some minimal coordination to avoid mutual interference. The families competed to maintain a system of checks and balances among equal powers.&lt;ref name=jacq24&gt;Jacquemet, ''Credibility in Court'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Camorra's strategies to gain social prestige was and remains political patronage. The family clans became the preferred go-betweens of local politicians and public officials because of their grip on the community. In turn, the family bosses used their political sway to assist and protect their clients against the local authorities. Through a mixture of brute force, political status, and social leadership, the Camorra clans gained ground as middlemen between the local community and bureaucrats and politicians at national level. They granted privileges and protection, and intervened in favour of their clients, in return for their silence and connivance against local authorities and the police. With their political connections, the heads of the major Neapolitan families became power brokers in local and national political contexts, providing Neapolitan politicians with broad electoral support, and in return receiving benefits for their constituency.&lt;ref name=jacq24/&gt;

==Activities==
Compared to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]'s pyramidal structure, the Camorra has more of a 'horizontal' structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/2/457/5060718 |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524224934/https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/86/2/457/5060718 |archive-date=24 May 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Camorra clans act independently of one another and are more prone to feuding. This, however, makes the Camorra more resilient when top leaders are arrested or killed, as new clans and organisations emerge from the remnants of old ones. Clan leader [[Pasquale Galasso]] stated in court, &quot;Campania can get worse because you could cut into a Camorra group, but another ten could emerge from it.&quot;&lt;ref name=behan184&gt;Behan, ''Camorra'', pp. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Raffaele Cutolo]] made an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Camorra families in the manner of the Sicilian Mafia, by forming the [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata|New Organized Camorra]] (''Nuova Camorra Organizzata'' or ''NCO''). [[Drive-by shooting]]s by ''camorristi'' often result in casualties among the local population but such episodes are often difficult to investigate because of the widespread practise of [[omertà]] (code of silence). According to a report published in 2007 by Confesercenti, the second-largest Italian trade organisation, the Camorra control the milk and fish industries, the coffee trade, and over 2,500 bakeries in Naples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1292115/Die_Mafia_ist_Italiens_fuehrendes_Unternehmen.html &quot;Die Mafia ist Italiens führendes Unternehmen&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319151030/http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1292115/Die_Mafia_ist_Italiens_fuehrendes_Unternehmen.html |date=19 March 2012 }}, [[Die Welt]], 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Italian law enforcement estimated that there were about a dozen Camorra clans.

In 2004 and 2005, the [[Di Lauro clan]] and the so-called [[Scissionisti di Secondigliano]] fought a bloody feud which came to be known in the Italian press as the [[Scampia feud]]. The result was over 100 street killings. At the end of October 2006 a new series of murders took place in Naples between 20 competing clans, costing 12 lives in 10 days.  The Interior Minister, [[Giuliano Amato]], decided to send more than 1,000 extra police and carabinieri to Naples to fight crime and protect tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=German|url=https://m.tagesspiegel.de/politik/mit-mehr-polizei-gegen-die-camorra/771076.html|title=Mit mehr Polizei gegen die Camorra|author=Paul Kreiner|newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=24 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524222037/https://m.tagesspiegel.de/politik/mit-mehr-polizei-gegen-die-camorra/771076.html|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in the following year there were over 120 murders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In recent years, various Camorra clans have been allegedly using alliances with [[organized crime in Nigeria|Nigerian drug gangs]] and the [[Albanian mafia]]. [[Augusto La Torre]], the former La Torre clan boss who became a [[pentito]], is married to an Albanian woman; the first foreign pentito, a Tunisian, admitted to being involved with the feared [[Casalesi clan]] of [[Casal di Principe]]. The first town in which the Camorra sanctioned stewardship by a foreign clan was [[Castel Volturno]], which was given to the Rapaces, clans from [[Lagos]] and [[Benin City]] in Nigeria. This allowed them to traffic cocaine and women in sexual slavery before sending them across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/eng/article/22391/roberto-saviano-on-the-italian-camorra.html|title=Roberto Saviano on the Italian Camorra|website=Cafe Babel|date= 8 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001022818/http://www.cafebabel.com/eng/article/22391/roberto-saviano-on-the-italian-camorra.html|archivedate=1 October 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste crisis==
{{main|Naples waste management issue|Triangle of death (Italy)|Ecomafia}}
Since the 1980s, the Camorra has taken over the handling of waste disposal in the region of [[Campania]]. By December 1999, all regional [[landfill]]s had reached capacity.&lt;ref name=giacomo/&gt; Reports in 2008 stated that the crisis was caused at least in part by the Camorra, which created a lucrative business in the municipal waste disposal business, mostly in the triangle of death. With the complicity of industrial companies, heavy metals, [[industrial waste]], and chemicals and household waste are frequently mixed together, then dumped near roads and burned to avoid detection, leading to severe soil and air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=nw20080109155132644C221895&amp;click_id=143&amp;set_id=1 Mafia at centre of Naples' rubbish mess] 9 January 2008.

According to Giacomo D'Alisa et al., &quot;the situation worsened during this period as the Camorra diversified their illegal waste disposal strategy: 1) transporting and dumping hazardous waste in the countryside by truck; 2) dumping waste in illegal caves or holes; 3) mixing toxic waste with textiles to avoid explosions and then burning it; and 4) mixing toxic with urban waste for disposal in landfills and [[incinerator]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=giacomo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=D'Alisa |first1=Giacomo |last2=Burgalassi |first2=David |last3 =Healy|first3 =Hali|last4=Walter|first4=Mariana |date=2010 |title=Conflict in Campania: Waste emergency or crisis of democracy |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=70 |issue= 2|pages=239–249 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangle of death and the waste management crisis is primarily a result of [[government failure]] to control illegal waste dumping. The government had attempted to mandate recycling and waste management programs, but were unable, causing the expansion of opportunities for illegal activities, which caused further barriers to solve the waste crisis.&lt;ref name=giacomo/&gt;&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Senior|first1=Kathryn|last2=Mazza|first2=Alfredo|date=September 2004|title=Italian &quot;Triangle of death&quot; linked to waste crisis|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(04)01561-X/fulltext?code=lancet-site&amp;dgcid=recommender_referral_trendmd|journal=The Lancet Oncology|language=English|volume=5|issue=9|pages=525–527|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01561-X|pmid=15384216|issn=1470-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiorillo|first=Damiano|date=2010-2013|title=Household waste recycling: national survey evidence from Italy|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|language=en|volume=56|issue=8|pages=1125–1151|doi=10.1080/09640568.2012.709180|s2cid=32409943|issn=0964-0568|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33631/1/MPRA_paper_33631.pdf|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922094228/https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33631/1/MPRA_paper_33631.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Policy Analysis Concepts and Practice|last1=Weimer|first1=David L.|last2=Vining|first2=Aidan R.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-21651-8|location=New York|pages=74–112, 149–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, a demonstration by tens of thousands of people was held in Naples in protest against the pollution caused by the Camorra's control of refuse disposal. Over a twenty-year period, it was alleged, about ten million tonnes of industrial waste had been illegally dumped, with cancers caused by pollution increasing by 40–47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24976917 |title=Naples rally against mafia's toxic waste dumping |publisher=BBC |date=17 November 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704213039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24976917 |archive-date=4 July 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to fight the Camorra==
The Camorra has proven to be an extremely difficult organisation to fight within Italy. At 1911–12 trial, Fabroni gave testimony on how complicated it was to successfully prosecute the Camorra: &quot;The Camorrist has no political ideals. He exploits the elections and the elected for gain. The leaders distribute bands throughout the town, and they have recoursed to violence to obtain the vote of the electors for the candidates whom they have determined to support. Those who refuse to vote as instructed are beaten, slashed with knives, or kidnapped. All this is done with assurance of impunity, as the Camorrists will have the protection of successful politicians, who realize that they cannot be chosen to office without paying toll to the Camorra.&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt130711&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/07/13/105030896.pdf|title=Says Politicians Hire The Camorra; Capt. Fabroni Declares Nobody Can Be Elected in Naples Without Its Aid|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 July 1911|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Sicilian Mafia, which has a clear hierarchy and a division of interests, the Camorra's activities are much less centralised. This makes the organisation much more difficult to combat through crude repression.&lt;ref name=behan114&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In Campania, where unemployment is high and opportunities are limited, the Camorra has become an integral part of the fabric of society. It offers a sense of community and provides the youth with jobs.  Members are guided in the pursuit of criminal activities, including [[cigarette smuggling]], drug trafficking, and theft.&lt;ref name=tim011106&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article621615.ece|title=Analysis: Naples, a city in the grip of the Camorra|last=Owen|first=Richard|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907043019/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article621615.ece|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has made an effort to combat the Camorra's criminal activities in Campania. The solution ultimately lies in Italy's ability to offer values, education and work opportunities to the next generation. However, the government has been hard pressed to find funds for promoting long-term reforms that are needed to improve the local economic outlook and create jobs.&lt;ref name=tim011106/&gt; Instead, it has had to rely on limited law enforcement activity in an environment that has a long history of tolerance and acceptance of criminality and is governed by the omertà.&lt;ref name=behan129&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the overwhelming magnitude of the problem, law enforcement officials continue their pursuit. The Italian police are coordinating their efforts with [[Europol]] and [[Interpol]] to conduct special operations against the Camorra. The Carabinieri and the Financial Police (''[[Guardia di Finanza]]'') are also fighting criminal activities related to tax evasion, border controls, and money laundering. Prefect Gennaro Monaco, Deputy Chief of Police and Chief of the Section of Criminal Police cites &quot;impressive results&quot; against the Camorra in recent years, yet the Camorra continues to grow in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naa.be/archivedpub/trip/ar81gen9835-palermo.asp | title=Sub-committee onpo East-West Economic Co-operation and Convergence and Sub-committee on Civilian Security and Co-operation Trip Report: Visit to Rome / Palermo Secretariat Report 6–8 May 1998 (Prefect Gennaro Monaco, Deputy-Chief of Police and Chief of the Section of Criminal Police) | date=18 August 1998 | publisher=NATO Parliamentary Assembly | accessdate=24 January 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707044714/http://www.naa.be/archivedpub/trip/ar81gen9835-palermo.asp | archive-date=7 July 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, police took a leading Camorra figure into custody. [[Francesco Schiavone]] was caught hiding in a secret apartment near Naples behind a sliding wall of granite. The mayor of Naples, Antonio Bassolino, compared the arrest to that of Sicilian Mafia chief [[Salvatore Riina]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=bbc110798&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/131042.stm|title=Mafia 'big man' arrested|work=BBC News|date=11 July 1998|accessdate=24 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527115219/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/131042.stm|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiavone is now serving a life sentence after a criminal career which included arms trafficking, bomb attacks, armed robbery, and murder.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

The arrests in the Campania region demonstrate that the police are not allowing the Camorra to operate without intervention.  However, progress remains slow, and these minor victories have done little to loosen the Camorra's grip on Naples and the surrounding regions.&lt;ref name=tim011106/&gt;

In 2008, Italian police arrested three members of the Camorra crime syndicate on 30 September 2008. According to Gianfrancesco Siazzu, commander of the Carabinieri police, the three were captured in small villas on the coast of Naples. All three had been on Italy's 100 top most wanted list. Police seized assets valued at over 100 million euros and also weapons, including two [[AK-47]] assault rifles that may have been used in the [[Castel Volturno massacre|shooting of six Africans]] on 18 September 2008. Police found pistols, Carabinieri uniforms and other outfits that were used to disguise members of the operation. During the same week, a separate operation netted 26 additional suspects in [[Caserta]]. All were believed to belong to the powerful Camorra crime syndicate that operates in and around Naples. The suspects were charged with extortion and weapons possession. In some cases, the charges also included murder and robbery. Giuseppina Nappa, the 48-year-old wife of a jailed crime boss, was among those arrested. She is believed to be the Camorra's local paymaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/wires/ap/world/2008/09/30/D93H20EG0_eu_italy_mafia_arrests/index.html | author=Alessandra Rizzo | title=Italy arrests scores of suspected mobsters | date=30 September 2008 | work=Salon | accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

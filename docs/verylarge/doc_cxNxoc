|quote=&quot;More than anyone else I can think of, Elizabeth Taylor represents the complete movie phenomenon – what movies are as an art and an industry, and what they have meant to those of us who have grown up watching them in the dark...

Taylor has also been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of women in Western society. [[Camille Paglia]] writes that Taylor was a &quot;pre-feminist woman&quot; who &quot;wields the sexual power that feminism cannot explain and has tried to destroy. Through stars like Taylor, we sense the world-disordering impact of legendary women like [[Delilah]], [[Salome]], and Helen of Troy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/03/24/camille_paglia_on_elizabeth_taylor/ |title=Paglia on Taylor: &quot;A luscious, opulent, ripe fruit!&quot; |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=March 24, 2011 |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, cultural critic M.G.

(1966) &quot;depicts the anguish that befalls a woman when the only way she can express herself is through her husband's stalled career and children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lord&quot; /&gt;}} Similarly, Ben W.

'''''On the Waterfront''''' is a 1954 American [[crime drama]] film, directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]. It stars [[Marlon Brando]] and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Pat Henning]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The musical score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by &quot;Crime on the Waterfront&quot; by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November–December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{AFI film|51286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film focuses on union violence and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].

''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success. It received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and won eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]]; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.

In 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was one of the first 25 films to be deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/91732574/|title=On the waterfront|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Irish Mob|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play &quot;D and D&quot; (&quot;deaf and dumb&quot;), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.

Terry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley &quot;the Gent&quot; ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man.  Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly instructed Charley to have Terry deliberately lose a fight so that Friendly could win money by betting against him. Terry coaxes Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to &quot;lean&quot; on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.

Joey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames &quot;waterfront priest&quot; Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. &quot;Kayo&quot; Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.

Although Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned &quot;sermon on the docks&quot; reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary|crucifixion]], Terry is at first willing to remain &quot;D and D&quot;, even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.

As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry, offering him a good job where he can receive kickbacks without any physical work, and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. &quot;I coulda' had class. I coulda' been a contender. I could've been somebody&quot;, laments Terry to his brother, &quot;Instead of a bum, which is what I am – let's face it.&quot; Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered that night near the apartment and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.

After finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying in court instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].

After the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move far away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.

===Screenplay and political context===
{{refimprovesect|date=June 2020}}
{{further|McCarthyism}}

The film is widely considered to be [[Elia Kazan]]'s answer to those who criticized him for identifying eight (former) Communists in the film industry before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952. One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally titled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie &quot;pro-American&quot;. Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archive-date=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, &quot;Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?&quot; This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.

Schulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.

===Real-life basis for characters===
{{unrefsect|date=June 2020}}
Terry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.

The character of Father Barry was based on the real-life &quot;waterfront priest&quot; [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.

The character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] East River dock boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head  [[Albert Anastasia]], who was underboss and later the boss for the Mangano crime family that ran the Brooklyn docks, later renamed the Gambino crime family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.

===Casting===
{{refimprovesect|date=June 2020}}
According to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had &quot;a handshake deal&quot;{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a &quot;more Brando-like&quot; actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that &quot;an actor like Marlon Brando&quot; could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterward, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had been signed for this role.

The part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey. He gave the part to Saint.

The role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.

Several of the labor boss's men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional heavyweight boxers in real life.

===Filming locations===
''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.&lt;ref name=movielove&gt;{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A. H. Weiler called the film &quot;an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weiler, A. H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/29/movies/19540729waterfront.html?_r=0 &quot;Movie Review: On the Waterfront&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 29, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

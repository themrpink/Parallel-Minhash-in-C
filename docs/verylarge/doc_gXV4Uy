====Public lobbyist registers====
A register of federal lobbyists is kept by the [[Australian Government]] and is accessible to the public via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/who_register.cfm|title = Who is on the register?|access-date = 2015-04-15|website = Department of the Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet|publisher = Australian Government|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181201093418/https://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/who_register.cfm|archive-date = 2018-12-01|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar registers for State government lobbyists were introduced between 2007 and 2009 around Australia. Since April 2007 in Western Australia, only lobbyists listed on the state's register are allowed to contact a government representative for the purpose of lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.lobbyists.wa.gov.au/Pages/About.aspx|title = About the Register|date = 2011-07-20|access-date = 2015-04-15|website = Public Sector Commission - Register of Lobbyists|publisher = Government of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules have applied in Tasmania since 1 September 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Register of Lobbyists : Register of Lobbyists|url = http://lobbyists.dpac.tas.gov.au/|website = lobbyists.dpac.tas.gov.au|access-date = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] since 1 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dpc.sa.gov.au/south-australian-lobbyist-code-conduct-and-register|title = South Australian Lobbyist Code of Conduct and Public Register|access-date = 2015-04-15|website = Department of Premier &amp; Cabinet|publisher = Government of South Australia|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150411075116/http://dpc.sa.gov.au/south-australian-lobbyist-code-conduct-and-register|archive-date = 2015-04-11|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lobbyistsregister.vic.gov.au/lobbyistsregister/index.cfm?event=faq|title = Questions and answers for Victorian Register of Lobbyists|date = 2014-06-20|website = Victorian Public Sector Commissioner - Register of Lobbyists|publisher = State Government of Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
{{Main|European Union lobbying}}
[[File:EP-BrusselWiertzstraat-boom.jpg|thumb|Wiertzstraat in Brussels. This 'lobby tree' in front of the main entrance of the European Parliament was planted in 2001 at the initiative of SEAP, the professional organization of lobbyists.]]
The first step towards specialized regulation of lobbying in the European Union was a Written Question tabled by Alman Metten, in 1989. In 1991, Marc Galle, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, was appointed to submit proposals for a Code of conduct and a register of lobbyists. Today lobbying in the European Union is an integral and important part of decision-making in the EU. From year to year lobbying regulation in the EU is constantly improving and the number of lobbyists increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2015|title=EU standards for the regulation of lobbying|url=https://www.academia.edu/37339449|journal=Prawa Człowieka|volume=nr 18|pages=98, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Austrian [[Member of the European Parliament]] (&quot;MEP&quot;) [[Hans-Peter Martin]], the value of lobby invitations and offers each individual MEP receives can reach up to €10,000 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New Europe (newspaper)|New European]] |date=April 25, 2011 |url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/taming-brussels-lobby |title=Taming Brussels lobby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 there were around 15,000 lobbyists (consultants, lawyers, associations, corporations, NGOs etc.) in [[Brussels]] seeking to influence the EU’s legislation. Some 2,600 special interest groups had a permanent office in Brussels. Their distribution was roughly as follows: European trade federations (32%), consultants (20%), companies (13%), NGOs (11%), national associations (10%), regional representations (6%), international organizations (5%) and [[think tank]]s (1%), (Lehmann, 2003, pp iii).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_society/interest_groups/docs/workingdocparl.pdf |title= Lobbying in the European Union: current rules and practices |first=Wilhelm |last=Lehman |year= 2003 |access-date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apertacontrada.it/2013/02/21/form-of-government-and-lobbies-in-uk-and-ue-a-comparative-perspective/  |first= Pier Luigi |last=Petrillo |title=Form of government and lobbying UK and UE, a comparative perspective |date=March 2013 |publisher=Apertacontrada.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, lobby organisations sometimes hire former EU employees (a phenomenon known as the revolving door) who possess inside knowledge of the EU institutions and policy process &lt;ref name=&quot;transparency.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transparency.eu/access-all-areas/|title=Transparency International EU (2017) Access All Areas: when EU politicians become lobbyists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Transparency International]] EU published in January 2017 analysed the career paths of former EU officials and found that 30% of Members of the [[European Parliament]] who left politics went to work for organisations on the EU lobby register after their mandate and approximately one third of Commissioners serving under Barroso took jobs in the private sector after their mandate, including for [[Uber]], [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]. These potential conflicts of interest could be avoided if a stronger ethics framework were established at the EU level, including an independent ethics body and longer cooling-off periods for MEPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;transparency.eu&quot;/&gt;

In the wake of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] in Washington D.C. and the massive impact this had on the lobbying scene in the [[United States]], the rules for lobbying in the EU—which until now consist of only a non-binding code of conduct-—may also be tightened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/com2006_194_en.pdf Green Paper on European Transparency Initiative] [[European Commission]], 2006.  Retrieved September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually on 31 January 2019 the [[European Parliament]] adopted binding rules on lobby transparency. Amending its Rules of Procedure, the Parliament stipulated that [[MEPs]] involved in drafting and negotiating legislation must publish online their meetings with lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://transparency.eu/press-release-european-parliament-to-end-secret-lobby-meetings EU Parliament to end secret lobby meetings]&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment says that “rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs or committee chairs shall, for each report, publish online all scheduled meetings with interest representatives falling under the scope of the [[Transparency Register]]”-database of the EU. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2018-0462_EN.pdf Text adopted by EU Parliament on lobbying transparency]&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
There is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/091028_fr.htm |title=Pleins feux sur les lobbies dans l'UE (28 October 2009) |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2009-10-28 |access-date=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; where French lobbyists can register themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pseudo * |url=http://www.dsmw.org/lobbying.html |title=Le lobbying passe aussi par le web (12 March 2012) |publisher=Dsmw.org |access-date=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf French National Assembly : Motion for a Resolution on Lobbying (21 November 2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325060849/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
A 2016 study found evidence of significant indirect lobbying of then-PM [[Silvio Berlusconi]] through business proxies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Market-Based Lobbying: Evidence from Advertising Spending in Italy †|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|pages = 224–256|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/app.20150042|first1 = Stefano|last1 = DellaVigna|first2 = Ruben|last2 = Durante|first3 = Brian|last3 = Knight|first4 = Eliana La|last4 = Ferrara|year = 2016|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors document a significant pro-[[Mediaset]] (the mass media company founded and controlled by Berlusconi) bias in the allocation of advertising spending during Berlusconi's political tenure, in particular for companies operating in more regulated sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[Lobbying in the United States]] describes paid activity in which special interests hire professional advocates to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies, such as the [[United States Congress]].  Some lobbyists are now using [[social media]] to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/government-lobbyists-social-media/|date=13 June 2016|title=Government Lobbyists Are More Nimble Than Ever|publisher=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the [[S&amp;P 500]], and concluded that spending on lobbying was a &quot;spectacular investment&quot; yielding &quot;blistering&quot; returns comparable to a high-flying [[hedge fund]], even despite the financial downturn.&lt;ref name=twsM23&gt;{{cite news |author= Brad Plumer |title= The outsized returns from lobbying |work= [[The Washington Post]] |quote= ...Hiring a top-flight lobbyist looks like a spectacular investment ... |date= October 10, 2011 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-outsized-returns-from-lobbying/2011/10/10/gIQADSNEaL_blog.html |access-date= 2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 [[meta-analysis]] of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance.&lt;ref name=tws2NovZ111&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lux, Sean |author2=Crook, T.

(8 April 2009). &quot;[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1375082 Measuring Rates of Return for Lobbying Expenditures: An Empirical Case Study of Tax Breaks for Multinational Corporations]&quot; Retrieved 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Major American corporations spent $345 million lobbying for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/02/how-did-opening-borders-to-mass-immigration-become-a-left-wing-idea/|title=How did opening borders to mass immigration become a 'Left-wing' idea?|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign-funded lobbying efforts include those of [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel]], [[Saudi Arabia lobby in the United States|Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkish lobby in the United States|Turkey]], [[Egypt lobby in the United States|Egypt]], [[Pakistani lobby in the United States|Pakistan]], and [[China Lobby|China]] lobbies. In 2010 alone, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbying members of Congress and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollcall.com/news/Lobbying_by_Foreign_Countries_Decreases-208745-1.html Lobbying by Foreign Countries Decreases].

A study from the [[Kellogg School of Management]] found that political donations by corporations do not increase shareholder value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/do-corporate-campaign-contributions-buy-influence|title=When Corporations Donate to Candidates, Are They Buying Influence?}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Why|date=August 2019}}

===Other countries===
Other countries where lobbying is regulated in parliamentary bills include:
*'''Canada''': Canada maintains a Registry of Lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/eic/site/012.nsf/eng/00884.html |title=Frequently asked questions |date=October 10, 2014 |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada |access-date=April 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Politics of Israel#Interest groups|'''Israel''']] (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/lobby_eng.htm |title=Lobbies in the Knesset |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date=1997-04-01 |access-date=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''India''': In [[India]], where there is no law regulating the process, lobbying had traditionally been a tool for industry bodies (like FICCI) and other pressure groups to engage with the government ahead of the national budget. One reason being that lobbying activities were repeatedly identified in the context of corruption cases. For example, in 2010, leaked audio transcripts of Nira Radia. Not only private companies but even the Indian government has been paying a fee every year since 2005 to a US firm to lobby for ex. to the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/indian-government-cuts-down-on-us-lobbying-to-lowest-in-7-years/articleshow/59832222.cms |title=Indian government cuts down on US lobbying to lowest in 7 years |date=July 30, 2017 |newspaper=The Economic Times |access-date=January 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, there are no laws that defined the scope of lobbying, who could undertake it, or the extent of disclosure necessary. Companies are not mandated to disclose their activities and lobbyists are neither authorized nor encouraged to reveal the names of clients or public officials they have contacted. The distinction between Lobbying and bribery still remains unclear. In 2012, Walmart revealed it had spent $25 million since 2008 on lobbying to &quot;enhance market access for investment in India.&quot; This disclosure came weeks after the Indian government made a controversial decision to permit FDI in the country's multi-brand retail sector.

*Ukraine: In 2009, a special working group of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine developed a draft law &quot;On Lobbying&quot;. However, this bill was not introduced into the Parliament of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2010|title=Legalization, accreditation, control and supervisory activity concerning lobbyists and lobbying organizations: prospects for Ukraine|url=http://vlz.in.ua/uploads/File/pdf/St/2010-і/2010-1s/Nesterovich.pdf|journal=Power. Man. Law. International Scientific Journal|volume=№ 1|pages=96–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Kazakhstan: Since the last century, since 1998, Kazakhstan has been trying to pass a law on lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Трубачева |first1=Татьяна |title=Нужно ли в Казахстане узаконить лоббистов? |url=https://forbes.kz/process/expertise/protolkni_eto_1525161874/ |website=www.forbes.kz |date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Chamber of Entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan &quot;Atameken&quot; is one of the first official lobbying structures in the country. But there are other examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lobbying interests in the structures of Kazakhstan. |url=https://sites.google.com/view/serikds/primary?authuser=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC's activities, while legal,&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; received public scrutiny after news reports from outlets such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' described ALEC as an organization that gave corporate interests outsized influence.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=stealth/&gt; Resulting public pressure led to a number of legislators and corporations withdrawing from the organization.

==History==
===1973 to 2010===
ALEC was founded in 1973 in [[Chicago]] as the Conservative Caucus of State Legislators a project initiated by Mark Rhoads, an [[Illinois State Capitol|Illinois state house]] staffer, to counter the [[Environmental Protection Agency]],{{huh|EPA was created in the 1970s|date=July 2020}} [[wage controls|wage]], and [[price controls]], and to respond to the defeat of [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Bishop2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Bishop|first=Bill|title=The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded American Is Tearing Us Apart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAqNKMfgdk4C&amp;pg=PT203|year=2009|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn=978-0547525198|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rizzo2/&gt;

Conservative legislators felt the word &quot;conservative&quot; was unpopular with the public at the time, however, so the organization was renamed as, the American Legislative Exchange Council.&lt;ref name=Bishop2009/&gt; In 1975, with the support of the [[American Conservative Union]], ALEC registered as a federal nonprofit agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenwald |first=Jonathan M. |title=A Time for Choosing: The Rise of Modern American Conservatism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdbqQsQlI3IC&amp;pg=PA241 |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195157260 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lichtman2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Lichtman |first=Allan J. |title=White Protestant Nation: The Rise of the American Conservative Movement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3q92ePfQDloC&amp;pg=PA318 |year=2009 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0802144201 |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Moyers]] and [[Greenpeace]] have attributed the establishment of ALEC to the influential [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.#Powell Memorandum|Powell Memorandum]], which led to the rise of a new business activist movement in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlie|last=Cray|date=August 23, 2011|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/the-lewis-powell-memo-corporate-blueprint-to-/blog/36466/|title=The Lewis Powell Memo – Corporate Blueprint to Dominate Democracy|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bill|last=Moyers|date=November 2, 2011|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/164349/how-wall-street-occupied-america|title=How Wall Street Occupied America]|journal=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC was co-founded by conservative activist [[Paul Weyrich]], who also co-founded [[The Heritage Foundation]].&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bishop2009/&gt; [[Henry Hyde]], who later became a U.S. congressman, and Lou Barnett, who later became national political director of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Political Action Committee, also helped to found ALEC. Early members included a number of state and local politicians who went on to statewide office, including [[Bob Kasten]], [[Tommy Thompson]], and [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] of Wisconsin, [[John Engler]] of Michigan, [[Terry Branstad]] of Iowa, [[Mitch Daniels]] of Indiana, and [[John Boehner]] and [[John Kasich]] of Ohio.&lt;ref name=hill04232012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/juan-williams/222965-martin-case-puts-alec-in-spotlight|title=Trayvon killing puts American Legislative Exchange Council in the spotlight|newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=April 23, 2012|first=Juan|last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of Congress also were involved in the organization during its early years, including Rep. [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, Sen. [[Jesse Helms]] of North Carolina, Sen. [[James L. Buckley]] of New York, Rep. [[Phil Crane]] of Illinois, and Rep [[Eric Cantor]] of Virginia.&lt;ref name=hill04232012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1UGM0CHOGAC&amp;q=james+buckley+%22american+Legislative+Exchange+Council%22+helms&amp;pg=PA62|title=Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent|volume=Vol. 1|editor1-first=Thomas C.|editor1-last=Hunt|editor2-first=Thomas J.|editor2-last=Lasley, II|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|date=January 12, 2010|isbn=9781412956642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Matthew Lewis Bologna opposed U.S. [[disinvestment from South Africa]], a movement to put pressure on the South African government to embark on [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiations]] with a goal of dismantling [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/12/11/alecs_institutional_corruption_from_backing_apartheid|title=ALEC's &quot;Institutional Corruption&quot;, From Backing Apartheid to Assault on Clean Energy, Public Sector|series=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, ALEC also published a memo that opposed &quot;the current homosexual movement&quot;, portrayed [[homosexuality]] as a result of a conscious choice, and said that [[pedophilia]] was &quot;one of the more dominant practices within the homosexual world&quot;.&lt;ref name=ashtari&gt;{{cite news|first=Shadee|last=Ashtari|date=December 5, 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/alec-anti-gay-documents_n_4386318.html|title=Right Wing Group's Extreme Anti-Gay History Revealed In New Document|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling discussed the document in 2013 and said that ALEC does not draft model bills on social issues, and added, &quot;I'm also sad that the critics would not acknowledge that organizations change over time.&quot;&lt;ref name=ashtari/&gt;

Duane Parde served as the executive director from December 1996 to January 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parde NTU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntu.org/about-ntu/staff/duane-parde.html |title=Duane Parde, president |year=2009 |work=About NTU: Staff |publisher=[[National Taxpayers Union]] |access-date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lori Roman, who served in the same role from 2006 to 2008, had an imperious style that led to financial difficulties and the departure of two thirds of ALEC's staff.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt; According to [[Dolores Mertz]], then a Democratic Iowa state representative and chairwoman of the ALEC board, ALEC became increasingly partisan during that period, with Roman once telling Mertz &quot;she didn't like Democrats and she wasn't going to work with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=dailybeast&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/04/former-chair-accuses-alec-of-anti-democrat-bias.html|title=Former Chair Accuses ALEC of Anti-Democrat Bias|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 4, 2012|first=Ben|last=Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Scheberle became executive director in 2010 after acting as a lobbyist for [[Verizon Communications]] (previously [[GTE]]) and as an ALEC board member.&lt;ref name=pssst&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/pssst-wanna-buy-a-law-12012011.html|title=Pssst ...

By 2011, the number of ALEC legislative members had reached 2,000, including more than 25 percent of all state legislators nationwide. Approximately 1,000 bills based on ALEC language were being introduced in state legislatures every year, with approximately 20% of those bills being enacted.&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;

===2011 to present===
Prior to 2011, ALEC's practices and its ties to specific pieces of legislation were little known outside of political circles.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; In July 2011, ''[[The Nation]]'' published a series of articles produced in collaboration with the [[Center for Media and Democracy]] (CMD) that showcased some of the ALEC model bills and described ties to the [[Koch family]], and CMD launched a website &quot;ALEC Exposed&quot; that documented more than 800 of ALEC model bills, the legislators and corporations that had helped to draft them, and the states that enacted them.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

The joint effort, and particularly its coverage of ALEC's push for tough [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter ID laws]], prompted the advocacy group [[Color of Change]] to launch a public campaign to pressure corporations to withdraw their ALEC memberships.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/exposing-alec-how-conservative-backed-state-laws-are-all-connected/255869/|title=Exposing ALEC: How Conservative-Backed State Laws Are All Connected|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=April 14, 2012|first=Nancy|last=Scola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism among media outlets and political opponents was that ALEC was secretly subverting democratic institutions to further the aims of its corporate benefactors.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; Oregon state representative and ALEC member [[Gene Whisnant]] said in December 2011, &quot;We're getting a lot of attention saying we're trying to destroy the earth and everything on it.&quot;&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt; ALEC staff and members promoted the organization as promoting public-private partnerships for the advancement of free market principles.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; ALEC senior director of membership and development Chaz Cirame said, &quot;The hook about some conspiracy or some secret organization is a lot better story than one about bringing state legislators together to talk about best practices around the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;

In 2012, ALEC was the subject of an [[Occupy movement]] protest, an [[Internal Revenue Service]] complaint by [[Common Cause]], and calls for attorney general investigations in several states.&lt;ref name=oregonian&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/05/alec_gains_foothold_in_oregon.html|title=ALEC gains foothold in Oregon, with one-fourth of legislators as members|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=May 26, 2012|first=Michelle|last=Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] on February 26, 2012 led to increased public attention on [[Stand-your-ground law|&quot;Stand-your-ground&quot; gun laws]] that ALEC had supported.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; Color of Change launched a new campaign in April to pressure ALEC corporate members to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Bedard |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/coke-caves-in-face-of-democratic-boycott-threat/article/444346|work=[[The Washington Examiner]] |title=Coke caves in face of Democratic boycott threat |date=April 4, 2012 |access-date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than sixty corporations and foundations, including [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Wendy's]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[McDonald's]], [[Amazon.com]], [[General Electric]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Walmart]], the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], and the medical insurance group [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield]] dropped support of ALEC in the ensuing weeks or let their memberships lapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Karen|last=McVeigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/05/coca-cola-pepsico-stand-your-ground|work=The Guardian|title=Coca-Cola and PepsiCo sever ties with group behind stand-your-ground laws|date=April 6, 2012|access-date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;motherjones.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Andy|title=The Gates Foundation Is Done Funding ALEC|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/04/alec-gates-foundation-pepsi-kraft|access-date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Andy|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/04/mcdonalds-alec-pepsi-kraft-voter-id|work=Mother Jones|title=McDonald's Says It Has Dumped ALEC|date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/12/us-wendys-idUSBRE83B1DW20120412|title=Reed Elsevier, Wendy's drop conservative group|date=April 12, 2012|access-date=February 17, 2015|work=[[Reuters]]|first1=Martinne|last1=Geller|first2=Jennifer|last2=Saba|location=[[New York, New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=overby&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Overby|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/13/150528572/as-pressure-mounts-companies-flee-coalition|title=Companies Flee Group Behind 'Stand Your Ground'|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Duda |url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2012/04/13/american-traffic-solutions-leaving-alec-joining-aps |title=American Traffic Solutions leaving ALEC, joining APS |work=azcapitoltimes.com |date=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Pecquet |url=https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/222049-blue-cross-blue-shield-quits-conservative-legislative-organization-alec |title=Blue Cross Blue Shield quits conservative legislative organization ALEC |date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/wal-mart-leaves-alec-22nd-company-exit-conservative-lobbying-group-701012|title=Wal-Mart Leaves ALEC, 22nd Company To Exit Conservative Lobbying Group|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=May 31, 2012|first=David|last=Zielenziger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-four legislative members also left ALEC.&lt;ref name=cpiexempt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/05/08/8828/alec-exempted-lobbyist-status-three-separate-states|title=ALEC exempted from lobbyist status in three separate states|publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]]|date=May 8, 2014|first=Paul|last=Abowd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC responded by releasing a statement describing efforts by its critics as a &quot;campaign launched by a coalition of extreme liberal activists committed to silencing anyone who disagrees with their agenda&quot;.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian20131203/&gt; Doug Clopp of Common Cause credited ALEC Exposed for the successful campaign, saying that &quot;for 40 years you couldn't get the kind of accountability we're seeing now because ALEC, its members, its legislators, its bills were secret.&quot;&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

As of December 2013, ALEC had more than 85 members of Congress and 14 sitting or former governors who were considered &quot;alumni&quot;.&lt;ref name=Guardian20131203 /&gt; The majority of the ALEC legislative members belong to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=governing2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stealth&quot;/&gt; Membership statistics presented at an ALEC board meeting in 2013 indicated that the 1,810 members represented 24% of all state legislative seats across the U.S., and that ALEC members represented 100% of the legislative seats in Iowa and South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/841593-alec-docs.html|title=ALEC documents collection|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has approximately 300 corporate, foundation, and other private-sector members.&lt;ref name=dentists&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-05/the-corporations-and-dentists-that-still-love-alec|title=The Corporations, and Dentists, That Still Love ALEC|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Politics]]|date=December 6, 2014|first=Julie|last=Bykowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairmanship of ALEC is a rotating position, with a new legislator appointed to the position each year. {{as of|2012}}, 28 out of 33 of its chairs had been Republicans.&lt;ref name=dailybeast/&gt;

ALEC has nine &quot;task forces&quot; that generate model bills that members may customize and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures. Private sector members effectively have [[veto power]] over model bills drafted by the task forces.&lt;ref name=governing2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt;

The ALEC Public Safety and Elections Task Force, which promoted stand your ground gun laws and voter identification requirements, was disbanded in April 2012. Thereafter, the [[National Center for Public Policy Research]] announced the creation of a voter ID task force to replace the one discontinued by ALEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Voter Identification Task Force Announced |url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/PR-VoterID_041812.html |work=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]] |date=April 18, 2012 |access-date=April 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423054948/http://www.nationalcenter.org/PR-VoterID_041812.html |archive-date=2012-04-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan J.

Bills drafted by the task forces must be approved by the ALEC board of directors, composed exclusively of legislators, before they are designated as model bills.&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; ALEC also has a &quot;Private Enterprise Advisory Council&quot;, which meets whenever the board of directors meets.&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt; Council members include representatives from prominent corporations such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Pfizer]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[SAP SE]], [[State Farm Insurance]], and [[Koch Industries]].&lt;ref name=wapo08072014/&gt; ALEC statements assert that the council provides advice to the board of directors.&lt;ref name=wapo08072014&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/nations-largest-small-business-group-faces-fresh-skepticism-over-new-link-to-alec/2014/08/06/15cdd8a8-1d7f-11e4-ab7b-696c295ddfd1_story.html|title=Nation's largest small-business group faces fresh skepticism over new link to ALEC|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 7, 2014|first=J.D.|last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ALEC co-chairman [[Noble Ellington]] said in 2011, &quot;I really kind of think of us as one board,&quot; although he added, &quot;It’s certainly not our goal to sit there and do everything that business wants to have done.&quot;&lt;ref name=pssst/&gt;

Day-to-day operations are run from ALEC's [[Arlington, Virginia]], office by an executive director and a staff of approximately 30. ALEC's bylaws specify that, &quot;... full membership shall be open to persons dedicated to the preservation of individual liberty, basic American values and institutions, productive free enterprise, and limited representative government, who support the purposes of ALEC, and who serve, or formerly serve, as members of a state or territorial legislature, the United States Congress, or similar bodies outside the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51770890/ALEC-s-2009-IRS-Form-990 |title=ALEC's 2009 IRS Form 990 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2012-03-01 |access-date=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC also has a &quot;Board of Scholars&quot; that advises staff and members. The board is composed of [[Arthur Laffer]], an economist who served on [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Economic Policy Advisory Board]]; Victor Schwartz, chair of Public Policy at [[Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Holden |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/22/scott-pruitt-where-are-his-emails-664285 |title=New Pruitt Question: Where-are-his-emails? |work=[[Politico]] |date=June 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Vedder]], economics professor emeritus at [[Ohio University]] and adjunct scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]]; and Bob Williams, founder of the [[Evergreen Freedom Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Board of Scholars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Scholars |url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/board-of-scholars/ |work=American Legislative Exchange Council |year=2012 |access-date=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 and after the war, Novello continued to write successfully for musical comedy and revue. The former included ''Who's Hooper?'' (1919), an adaptation of a [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]] play, with a book by [[Fred Thompson (writer)|Fred Thompson]], lyrics by [[Clifford Grey]], and music by [[Howard Talbot]] and Novello,&lt;ref&gt;Findon, B. W. &quot;Who's Hooper?&quot;, ''The Play Pictorial'', July 1919, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Moth'' by Thompson and [[P. G. Wodehouse]] (1921), for which Novello provided the entire score.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Golden Moth&quot;, ''The Times'', 6 October 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; For Charlot, he contributed numbers to the revues ''Tabs'' (1918), ''A to Z'' (1921) and ''Puppets'' (1924). For the second of these, his songs included one of his few well-known comedy numbers, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, with lyrics by [[Dion Titheradge]], written for [[Jack Buchanan]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the same time as his successes as a composer, Novello was making a career as an actor.  With &quot;a classic profile that gained him matinee idol status amongst the film-going public&quot;,&lt;ref name=oxpop&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/search_results?q=Ivor+Novello&amp;search=quick &quot;Ivor Novello&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 16 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was sought out, on the strength of a publicity photograph, by the Swiss film director [[Louis Mercanton]]. Mercanton offered him a silent-film role as the romantic lead in ''The Call of the Blood'' (1920).&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; In the same year, he made another film for Mercanton, ''Miarka''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Novello made his first British film, ''Carnival'', the following year.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Nina Vanna and Ivor Novello.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nina Vanna and Novello in &quot;[[The Man Without Desire]]&quot; (1923)]]
Novello made his stage debut in 1921 in ''Deburau'' by [[Sacha Guitry]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Theatres&quot;, ''The Times'', 20 October 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and, among other stage engagements in the next years, he played Bingley in a charity adaptation of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Plays of the Year&quot;, ''The Play Pictorial'', October 1922, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=105|isbn=1421422824}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about this time, Novello had an affair with the writer [[Siegfried Sassoon]]; it was short lived, but in the words of Sassoon's biographer John Stuart Roberts, Novello &quot;was a consummate flirt who collected lovers as he gathered lilacs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Novello made his American movie debut in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The White Rose (1923 film)|The White Rose]]''. The same year, he starred in &quot;[[The Man Without Desire]]&quot;, among other British films.&lt;ref&gt;Duguid, Mark. [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/506532/index.html &quot;''The Man Without Desire'' (1923)&quot;], BFI Screen Online, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He next co-wrote, produced and starred in the successful 1924 play ''[[The Rat (play)|The Rat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;It was credited to the pseudonymous David L'Estrange, but was the work of Novello and his friend, the actress [[Constance Collier]]: see ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; The play was made into a [[The Rat (1925 film)|film]] in 1925, which was so successful that two sequels followed in 1926 and 1928.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His dramatic roles in the West End included the title character in the first London production of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Duke of York's Theatre&quot;, ''The Times'', 24 December 1926, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Other films in which Novello starred included [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'', where he played the title character, and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both in 1927).  The British film company [[Gainsborough Pictures]] offered Novello a lucrative contract, which enabled him to buy a country house in [[Littlewick Green]], near [[Maidenhead]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He renamed the property Redroofs, and he entertained there famously and with little regard for convention. [[Cecil Beaton]], noting the frequent homosexual excesses, coined the phrase, &quot;the Ivor&amp;ndash;Noel naughty set&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Coward had by now caught Novello up professionally, despite a joint disaster when Novello starred in Coward's play ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' in 1927, which was a débâcle, and closed within a month of opening.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), pp.187–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Theatres. ''Sirocco'' to be Withdrawn&quot;, ''The Times'', 12 December 1927, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Novello starred in the silent adaptation of Coward's much more successful ''[[The Vortex]]'', and made his last silent film, ''[[A South Sea Bubble]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; During the late 1920s, Novello was the most popular male British film star and was often dubbed as Britain's &quot;handsomest screen actor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines|editor3-last=Menna|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=626 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macnab, Geoffrey.

Novello returned to composing for the lyric stage in 1929, writing eight numbers for the revue ''The House that Jack Built''. In the same year, he presented his own play ''Symphony in Two Flats'', which he took to New York the following year.  It was followed by a successful Broadway production of his ''[[The Truth Game]]'', which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. He accepted a contract to write for and appear in [[MGM]] films. He found little to do in Hollywood, however, beyond writing the dialogue for ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ODNB, &quot;he reputedly originated the line that gave rise to the now mythical if inaccurate 'Me Tarzan. You Jane' (originally – with appropriate pointing – 'Tarzan. Jane.')&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to London, he starred in the sound remake of ''[[The Lodger (1932 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==1930s musicals==
[[File:Ivor Novello (David Ivor Davies) (1893–1951) (gcf03577).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Novello by Emil Veresmith (oil on canvas, 1924) ([[National Library of Wales]])]]
After beginning the 1930s with a series of non-musical plays: ''I Lived with You'' (1932), ''[[Fresh Fields (play)|Fresh Fields]]'', ''Proscenium'', ''Sunshine Sisters'', ''Flies in the Sun'' (all 1933) and ''Murder in Mayfair'' (1934), Novello returned to composition in 1935 with ''[[Glamorous Night]]'', which was the first of a series of enormously popular musicals.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' considered that it was for these that Novello would be popularly remembered.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Paul Webb, in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', writes that Novello's show saved the fortunes of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]:
{{quote|Dominating the British musical theatre from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, his shows were heavily influenced by the operettas that he had grown up with (he saw ''[[Die lustige Witwe]]'' 27 times), but had a highly individual style of their own. Blending musicals with opera, operetta and both modern and classical dance, these shows were considered something of an anachronism in their own time, but that was part of their appeal.|}}
Another model was Coward's 1929 musical ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'', which Novello called &quot;a ''lovely'', lovely thing ... sheer joy from beginning to end&quot;. That, too, was an old-fashioned musical, &quot;so full of regret ... for a vanished kindly silly darling age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Novello to Coward, undated, in Day, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his four 1930s musicals, Novello wrote the book and music, [[Christopher Hassall]] wrote the lyrics, and the orchestrations were by Charles Prentice. ''Glamorous Night''  starred Novello and [[Mary Ellis]], with a cast including [[Zena Dare]], [[Olive Gilbert]] and [[Elizabeth Welch]], and ran from 2 May 1935 to 18 July 1936, at Drury Lane and then the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theatres&quot;, ''The Times'', 2 May 1935, p. 12; and 18 July 1936, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Careless Rapture]]'' ran from 11 September 1936 for 296 performances, with Novello, [[Dorothy Dickson]] and Zena Dare in the leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Drury Lane&quot;, ''The Times'', 12 September 1936, p. 10; and Gaye, p. 1529&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crest of the Wave (musical)|Crest of the Wave]]'' starred Novello, Dickson and Gilbert, and ran from 1 September 1937 for 203 performances.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The last of Novello's prewar musicals was ''[[The Dancing Years]]'', which starred Novello, Ellis and Gilbert, opened at Drury Lane, closed on the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], and reopened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], running for a combined total of 696 performances, closing on 8 July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1530&lt;/ref&gt; This show was the closest Novello came to fulfilling his mother's early ambitions for him to write operas; he played an Austrian composer-conductor at the [[Vienna State Opera|Wiener Hofoper]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

==Second World War and last years==
Novello presented only two new shows during the Second World War. ''Arc de Triomphe'' (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, was only a modest success, but ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of [[Gasoline|petrol]] coupons, a serious offence under [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#World War II|rationing laws]] in wartime Britain.  An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but the court found that Novello was also culpable.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 234. The offending fan, Dora Grace Constable, escaped with a £50 fine: see ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Not everybody was supportive; Coward's sympathy was limited: &quot;He's been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn't done a thing for the general effort&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.349; Coward's modified sympathy was later echoed in [[Ewan MacColl]]'s song &quot;Ivor&quot;: see MacColl, Ewan. ''Bad Lads and Hard Cases'', Riverside LP 1957&lt;/ref&gt; but when Novello returned to ''The Dancing Years'' after his release, he received &quot;a rapturous ovation&quot; on his first entrance.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Novello's last full-scale production in this style, ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949), was, in Webb's words, &quot;a selfconsciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; After the rigours of war, this escapist entertainment had strong box-office appeal, and ran for 841 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1533&lt;/ref&gt; The show starred Novello and the cast included [[Phyllis Dare]], Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Bobbie Andrews. It was still running, at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], when Novello's last show opened. This was ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). Novello had written no role for himself; the show starred the comedy actress [[Cicely Courtneidge]] and was a departure from his established pattern, balancing the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; ''The Times'' commented that the show &quot;cheerfully parodied the very [[Ruritania]]n romances to which he owed his most triumphant successes&quot;.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Novello died suddenly from a [[coronary thrombosis]] at the age of 58, a few hours after completing a performance in the run of ''King's Rhapsody''.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], and his ashes are buried beneath a [[lilac]] bush and marked with a plaque that reads &quot;Ivor Novello 6th March 1951 'Till you are home once more'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2. McFarland &amp; Company (2016) {{ISBN|0786479922}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left an estate worth £160,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27025051 |title=Composer Left £160,000 Estate. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=9 June 1951 |access-date=10 July 2012 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (£{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|160000|1951}}|0}} when adjusted for inflation).

Only a few weeks before Novello's death, Coward had written of him: &quot;Theatre – good, bad and indifferent – is the love of his life. For him, other human endeavours are mere shadows. ... The reward of his work lies in the indisputable fact that whenever and wherever he appears the vast majority of the British public flock to see him.&quot;&lt;ref name=tls&gt;[[Trewin, J. C.]] &quot;Popular Idol&quot;, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 18 May 1951, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' writes of Novello that he was &quot;until the advent of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], the 20th-century's most consistently successful composer of British musicals&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] for songwriting, established in 1955 in Novello's memory, are awarded each year by the [[The Ivors Academy]] (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA)) to British songwriters and composers as well as to an outstanding international music writer.&lt;ref&gt;Pegler, Martin. ''Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War'', Osprey Publishing, 2014, p. 248 {{ISBN|9781427804150}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarship in memory of Novello was established at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], and in 1952 a bronze bust of him by [[Clemence Dane]] was unveiled at Drury Lane. In [[St. Paul's, Covent Garden]], known as the actors' church, a panel was installed to commemorate Novello, and in 1972, to mark the 21st anniversary of his death, a memorial stone was unveiled in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1993, the centenary of Novello's birth was marked by several celebratory shows around the UK, including one at the [[Players Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=oxpop/&gt; In 2005, the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], above which Novello lived for many years, was renamed the Novello Theatre, with a plaque in his honour set at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1922138 &quot;Ivor Novello plaque, Aldwych&quot;], Geograph.org, accessed 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2009, a statue of Novello was unveiled outside the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in [[Cardiff Bay]]. Plaques detailing some of his best-known songs are fitted to the pedestal, along with a dedication to Novello.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8121374.stm &quot;Statue honours composer Novello&quot;], BBC News, 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Novello's memory is promoted by [[The Ivor Novello Appreciation Bureau]], which holds annual events around Britain, including an annual pilgrimage to [[Redroofs Theatre School|Redroofs]] each June. Redroofs was sold after Novello's death and is now a theatre training school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redroofs.co.uk/about.asp &quot;About us&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310122736/http://www.redroofs.co.uk/about.asp |date=10 March 2011 }}, Redroofs Associates, accessed 16 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Novello was portrayed in [[Robert Altman]]'s 2001 film ''[[Gosford Park]]'' by [[Jeremy Northam]], and several of his songs were used for the film's soundtrack, including &quot;Waltz of My Heart&quot;, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, &quot;I Can Give You the Starlight&quot;, &quot;What a Duke Should Be&quot;, &quot;Why Isn't It You?&quot; and &quot;The Land of Might-Have-Been&quot;.

==Songs==
[[File:Cloth, souvenir (AM 783288-1).jpg|thumb|Silk handkerchief with manuscript for &quot;[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (Ivor Novello song)|Keep The Home Fires Burning]]&quot; ]]
Among Novello's well-known songs are &quot;[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/keepthehomefiresburning.htm 1917 mp3 recording of &quot;Keep the home fires burning&quot;] sung by [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], firstworldwar.com, accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Fold Your Wings&quot;, &quot;Shine Through My Dreams&quot;, &quot;[[Rose of England]]&quot;, &quot;I Can Give You the Starlight&quot;, &quot;And Her Mother Came Too&quot;, &quot;My Dearest Dear&quot;, &quot;The Land of Might-Have-Been&quot;, &quot;When I Curtsied to the King&quot;, &quot;[[We'll Gather Lilacs]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; &quot;Someday My Heart Will Awake&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Waltz of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Why Isn't It You&quot;, &quot;My Life Belongs to You&quot;, &quot;Fly Home Little Heart&quot;, &quot;Take Your Girl&quot; and &quot;Primrose&quot;.

In ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Webb writes that although Novello's oeuvre is generally thought of as &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;[[Ruritanian]]&quot;, his music &quot;was far more varied than his current reputation suggests&quot;. Webb contends that such romantic hits as &quot;Someday My Heart Will Awake&quot; were balanced by &quot;rousing operetta choruses ... and jazz age numbers&quot; while {{&quot;'}}Rose of England' is a stately patriotic piece that stands comparison with [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] or [[William Walton|Walton]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The means of production includes two broad categories of objects: [[instruments of labor]] (tools, [[factories]], [[infrastructure]], etc.) and [[subjects of labor]] ([[natural resource]]s and [[raw material]]s). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Evans, ''Karl Marx'', London, England, 1975. Part II, Chap. 2, sect. a; p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[agrarian society]] the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an [[industrial society]] the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines. In a [[knowledge economy]], computers and networks are means of production. In a broad sense, the &quot;means of production&quot; also includes the &quot;means of [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]]&quot; such as stores, the internet and railroads ([[Infrastructural capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;Flower, B. O. ''The Arena'', Volume 37. The Arena Pub. Co, originally from Princeton University. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxism and Marxist theory of class==
{{Marxism|Economics}}
The analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the [[Marxist]] theoretical framework of historical materialism and in [[Marxian economics]].

In Marx's work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of [[socioeconomic]] evolution is based on the premise of [[technological improvements]] in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of [[Social relations of production|social relations]] become superfluous and unnecessary, creating contradictions between the level of technology in the means of production on the one hand and the [[organization of society]] and its [[economy]] on the other. These contradictions manifest themselves in the form of [[class conflicts]], which develop to a point where the existing mode of production becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a [[social revolution]]. The contradictions are resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of [[social relations]] including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production Mode of Production]. Marxism.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of the means of production and control over the [[surplus product]] generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different [[modes of production]]. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of [[unearned income]] for its owners. By contrast, [[socialism]] is defined as [[social ownership]] of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to [[society]] at large.

=== Determinant of class ===
Marx's theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the [[bourgeoisie]], or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. In contrast, the [[proletariat]], or [[working class]], comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their [[labor power]] for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ishiyama, Breuning |first= John, Marijke|title= 21st Century Political Science: A Reference Handbook |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |date= October 22, 2010|quote= For Marx, class was defined by an individual’s relationship to the means of production...Class is determined by the extent to which people own most, some, or little of the means of production, or by their relationship to the means of production. It is generally conflict over control or access to the means of production that drives history. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the question of why classes exist in [[human societies]] in the first place, Karl Marx offered a [[Marx's theory of history|historical]] and scientific explanation that it was the [[cultural practice]] of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on &quot;differences in ability&quot; between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to [[castes]]. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and [[Marxism and religion|Religion]] are seen as mere outgrowths ([[base and superstructure|superstructures]]) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/SUS80.html Frederick Engels: Socialism: Utopian and Scientific Chapter III Historical Materialism] Marx2mao.com.  p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
[[Factors of production]] are defined by German [[economist]] [[Karl Marx]] in his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'' as labor, [[subjects of labor]], and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the [[classical economics|classical school]] as &quot;land, labour and capital&quot;. Marx sometimes used the term &quot;productive forces&quot; equivalently with &quot;factors of production&quot;; in ''Kapital'', he uses &quot;factors of production&quot;, in his famous Preface to the ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'', he uses &quot;productive forces&quot; (that may depend on the translation).

[[relations of production|Production relations]] (German: ''Produktionsverhältnis'') are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are [[employer]]/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.

[[Mode of production]] (German: ''Produktionsweise'') means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, &quot;[[capitalism]]&quot; is the name for the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist ''mode of production'']] in which the means of production are [[Private property|owned privately]] by a small [[Social class|class]] (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who profits off the labor of the [[working class]] (the [[proletariat]]). [[Communism]] is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but [[Common ownership|shared in common]], without class based [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

'''Conrad Celtes''' ({{lang-de|Konrad Celtes}}; {{lang-la|Conradus Celtis (Protucius)}}; 1 February 1459 – 4 February 1508) was a [[Germans|German]] [[Renaissance humanist]] scholar and poet of the [[German Renaissance]] born in Franconia (nowadays part of [[Bavaria]]). He led the theatrical performances at the Viennese court and reformed the syllabi. In 1500, he published Tacitus' &quot;Germania&quot; and his rediscovered works (e.g. [[Hrotsvitha|Hrotsvit von Gandersheim]], 1501) and wrote the &quot;Quatuor libri amorum&quot; in 1500, after the model of [[Ovid]].

==Life==
Born at [[Wipfeld]], near [[Schweinfurt]] (present-day [[Lower Franconia]]) under his original name '''Konrad Bickel''' or '''Pyckell''' (modern spelling '''Pickel'''), Celtes pursued his studies at the [[University of Cologne]] (1477–1479; B.A., 1479) and at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (M.A., 1485). While at Heidelberg, he received instruction from [[Johann von Dalberg|Dalberg]] and [[Rodolphus Agricola|Agricola]]. As customary in those days for humanists, he [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] his name, to Conradus Celtis. For some time he delivered humanist lectures during his travels to [[Erfurt]], [[Rostock]] and [[Leipzig]]. His first work was titled ''Ars versificandi et carminum'' (The Art of Writing Verses and Poems, 1486). He further undertook lecture tours to Rome, Florence, [[Bologna]] and Venice.

The elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick of Saxony]] approached the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], who named Conrad Celtes ''[[Poet Laureate]]'' (Honored Poet) upon his return. At this great imperial ceremonial gathering in [[Nuremberg]], Celtes was at the same time presented with a [[doctoral degree]]. Celtes again made a lecturing tour throughout the empire. 

In 1489–1491, he stayed in [[Kraków]] where he studied mathematics, astronomy and the natural sciences at the [[Jagiellonian University]] (at which he enrolled in 1489),&lt;ref&gt;Harold B. Segel, ''Renaissance Culture in Poland: The Rise of Humanism, 1470-1543'', Cornell University Press, 1989, pp. 86 and 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and befriended many other humanists such as [[Lorenz Rabe]] and [[Bonacursius]]. He also founded a learned society, based on the [[Roman academies]]. The local branch of the society was called ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana]]'' (the &quot;Literary Society on the Vistula River&quot;).

In 1490 he once again went through [[Breslau]] ([[Wrocław]]) to [[Prague]], capital of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. [[Hartmann Schedel]] used Celtis' descriptions of Breslau in the ''Schedelsche Weltchronik'' ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]]). In Hungary, Celtis formed the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Hungaria]]'' (&quot;Hungarian Literary Society&quot;), later as ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Danubiana]]'' to be based in [[Vienna]]. He made stops at [[Regensburg]], [[Passau]] and [[Nuremberg]] (and probably [[Mainz]]). At Heidelberg he founded the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Rhenana]]'' (&quot;Rhineland Literary Society&quot;). Later he went to [[Lübeck]] and [[Ingolstadt]].  At Ingolstadt, in 1492, he delivered his famous speech to the students there, in which he called on Germans to rival Italians in learning and letters. This would later become an extremely popular address in sixteenth-century German nationalistic sentiment.

While the plague ravaged Ingolstadt, Celtes taught at Heidelberg. By now he was a professor. In 1497 Celtes was called to Vienna by the emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], who honored him as ''teacher of the art of poetry and conversation'' with an imperial ''Privilegium'', the first of its kind. There he lectured on the works of classical writers and in 1502 founded the  ''Collegium Poetarum'', a college for poets. His invitation to Vienna came about greatly at the influence of his friend and fellow scholar [[Johannes Cuspinian]]. 

Celtes died in Vienna a few years later of [[syphilis]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurens 2004, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad Celtes' teachings had lasting effects, particularly in the field of [[history]]. He was the first to teach the history of the world as a whole. He started work on the ''Germania Illustrata'' with ''Germania generalis'' and ''De origine, situ, moribus et institutis Norimbergae libellus'' (&quot;On the origins, site, habits and institutions of Nuremberg&quot;). He discovered and published the writings of [[Hroswitha of Gandersheim]]. Celtes also discovered a map showing roads of the Roman Empire, the ''Tabula Peutingeriana'', or [[Peutinger Table]]. Celtes collected numerous Greek and Latin manuscripts in his function as librarian of the imperial library that was founded by Maximilian, and he claimed to have discovered the missing books of [[Ovid]]’s [[Fasti (poem)|''Fasti'']] in a letter to the Venetian publisher [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1504.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Christopher S. Wood |title= Forgery, Replica, Fiction: Temporalities of German Renaissance Art |publisher= University Of Chicago Press |date= 2008 |page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purported new verses had [[Pseudepigrapha|actually been composed]] by an 11th-century monk and were known to the [[Empire of Nicaea]] according to [[William of Rubruck]], but even so, many contemporary scholars believed Celtes and continued to write about the existence of the missing books until well into the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Angela Fritsen |title= Antiquarian Voices: The Roman Academy and the Commentary Tradition on Ovid’s Fasti (Text and Context) |publisher= Ohio State University Press |date= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad Celtes was more of a free-thinking humanist and placed a higher value on the ancient pagan, rather than the Christian ideal. His friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] had blunt discussions with him on that subject.

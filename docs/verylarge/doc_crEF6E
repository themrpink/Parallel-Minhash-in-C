By the mid 1990s, it was decided that ''QE2'' was due for a new look and in 1994 the ship was given a multimillion-pound refurbishment in [[Hamburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt; code named Project Lifestyle.

On 11 September 1995, ''QE2'' encountered a [[rogue wave]], estimated at {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on}}, caused by [[Hurricane Luis]] in the North Atlantic Ocean about 200 miles south of eastern [[Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;luis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qe2.org.uk/luis.html|title=''Hurricane Luis Passenger Certificate'' |publisher=Qe2.org.uk |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, during her twentieth world cruise, she completed her four millionth mile. The ship had sailed the equivalent of 185 times around the planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;CunardHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cunard.co.uk/ |title=''Cunard History at a Glance'' |publisher=Cunard.co.uk |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''QE2'' celebrated the 30th anniversary of her maiden voyage in Southampton in 1999. In three decades she had 1,159 voyages, sailed {{convert|4648050|nmi|mi km}} and carried over two million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cunard.com/onboard/default.asp?OB=QE2&amp;Sub=sp&amp;SubSubSection=30Years|title=Queen Elizabeth 2&amp;nbsp;– The first 30 years|publisher=Cunard.com|accessdate=14 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211231919/http://www.cunard.com/onboard/default.asp?OB=QE2&amp;Sub=sp&amp;SubSubSection=30Years|archivedate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Following the 1998 acquisition of the Cunard Line by [[Carnival Corporation]], in 1999 ''QE2'' was given a US$30 million refurbishment which included refreshing various public rooms,&lt;ref name=TheQE2Story /&gt; and a new colour palette in the passenger [[cabin (ship)|cabins]]. The Royal Promenade, which formerly housed upscale shops such as [[Burberry]], H. Stern and [[Aquascutum]], were replaced by boutiques typical of cruise ships, selling perfumes, watches and logo items. During this refit the hull was stripped to bare metal, and the ship repainted in the traditional Cunard colours of matte black (Federal Grey) with a white superstructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrisqe2hist&quot; /&gt;

On 29 August 2002, ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' became the first merchant ship to sail more than 5 million nautical miles at sea.&lt;ref name=PayneP36/&gt;

In 2004, the vessel stopped plying the traditional transatlantic route and began full-time cruising, the transatlantic route having been assigned to Cunard's new flagship, the {{RMS|Queen Mary 2|3=2}}. However, ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' still undertook an annual world cruise and regular trips around the Mediterranean. By this time, she lacked the amenities to rival newer, larger cruise ships, but she still had unique features such as her ballrooms, hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/review.cfm?ShipID=247 |title=Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2)&amp;nbsp;– Cunard |publisher=Cruisecritic.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6,000-book library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-deckplans/ |title=QE2 Deckplans |accessdate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''QE2'' remained the fastest cruise ship afloat (28.5 knots&lt;ref name=&quot;fuel&quot;/&gt;), with fuel economy at this speed&lt;ref name=&quot;fuel&quot;/&gt; at 49.5&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20Statistics.html |title=The Cunarders: QE2 : Statistics |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326180245/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20Statistics.html |archive-date=26 March 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/QE2+GETS+SET+FOR+HER+LAST+VISIT%3B+Warm+welcome+expected.-a0168878004 |title=QE2 Fuel Usage |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tripatlas.com/Fuel%20efficiency%20in%20transportation |title=Trip Atlas QE2 Fuel |accessdate=12 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gallon (4 m/L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifton |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hampshire/7663226.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Hampshire &amp;#124; QE2's funnel 'to be sliced off' |work=BBC News |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cruising at slower speeds efficiency was improved to 125&amp;nbsp;ft per gallon (10 m/L).&lt;ref name=&quot;fuel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/QE2_fuel_economy.htm |title=QE2 Fuel Efficiency |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of her 2005 world cruise, some pieces of her artwork were damaged when some crew members who had become [[inebriated]] at an on-board crew party, went on a vandalism rampage through the public areas of the ship. A unique tapestry of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', commissioned for the launch of the ship, was thrown overboard by a drunken crewman. An oil painting of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and two other tapestries were also damaged, along with a part of the entertainment area and a lifeboat. The crew members involved were dismissed from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=1290 |title=Cruise Critic News: QE2 Winds Up World Cruise With a Whimper |publisher=Cruisecritic.com |date=20 April 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2004, ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' became Cunard's longest serving express liner, surpassing the [[RMS Aquitania|RMS ''Aquitania'']]{{'}}s 35 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;CunardHist&quot; /&gt; while on 4 September 2005, during a call to the port of Sydney, Nova Scotia, ''QE2'' became the longest serving Cunarder, surpassing the {{RMS|Scythia}}{{'}}s record.&lt;ref&gt;QE2 Daily Programme 04:09:05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and final Cunard voyage===
[[File:QM2, QE2 and QV.JPG|thumb|{{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} next to ''QE2'' with stern of {{MS|Queen Victoria}} on far right]]
On 18 June 2007, it was announced by Cunard that ''QE2'' had been purchased by the [[Dubai]] investment company [[Istithmar]] for $100 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;QE2Sold&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/qe2_sold.htm |title=Official QE2 Cunard-Istithmar Press Release |author=Cunard-Istithmar |date=18 June 2007 |publisher=Rob Lightbody |accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfNewsQE2Sale&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/business/tourism/istithmar-buys-qe2-for-100m-1.184774 |title=Istithmar buys QE2 for $100m |author=Shakir Husain |date=18 June 2007 |publisher=GulfNews.com |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118115116/http://gulfnews.com/business/tourism/istithmar-buys-qe2-for-100m-1.184774 |archive-date=18 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her retirement, in part, was forced by the oncoming June 2010 implementation of the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)]] regulations, which would have forced large and expensive structural changes to the ship.&lt;ref name=Otago240912/&gt;

In a ceremonial display before her retirement, ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' met the {{MS|Queen Victoria|3=2}} and ''Queen Mary 2'' near the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York Harbor]] on 13 January 2008, with a celebratory fireworks display; ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' and ''Queen Victoria'' had made a tandem crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] for the meet. This marked the first time three ''Cunard Queens'' had been present in the same location. (Cunard stated this would be the last time these three particular ships would meet, due to the impending retirement of ''Queen Elizabeth 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cunard.com/rendezvous |title=Royal Rendezvous: Sunday, 13 January 2008&amp;nbsp;– New York Harbor |publisher=Cunard |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113161744/http://www.cunard.com/rendezvous/ |archivedate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to a change in ''Queen Elizabeth 2''{{'}}s schedule, the three ships met again in Southampton on 22 April 2008.)

''QE2'' shared the harbour at [[Zeebrugge]] with ''Queen Victoria'' on 19 July 2008, where the two Cunarders exchanged whistle blasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7360081.stm |title=Three 'Queens' in final meeting; 22 April 2008 |work=BBC News |date=22 April 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2008, ''QE2'' set off from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] for [[Douglas Harbour|Douglas Bay]] on her farewell tour of Ireland and Britain, before heading for [[Liverpool]]. She left Liverpool and arrived in [[Belfast]] on 4 October 2008, before moving to [[Greenock]] the next day (the ship's height with funnel makes it impossible to pass under the [[Erskine Bridge]] so Clydebank is not reachable). There she was escorted by Royal Navy destroyer {{HMS|Manchester|D95|6}} and visited by {{MV|Balmoral|1949|6}}. The farewell was viewed by large crowds and concluded with a firework display.&lt;ref name=Highhopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2457396.0.Tearful_Clyde_says_goodbye_to_QE2.php |title=Tearful Clyde Says Goodbye To QE2 |author=Susan Swarbrick |date=6 October 2008 |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |accessdate=7 October 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009041547/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2457396.0.Tearful_Clyde_says_goodbye_to_QE2.php |archivedate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PSPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pspsscotland.blogspot.com/2008/10/balmoral-salutes-retiring-legend.html |title=The Paddle Steamer Preservation Society&amp;nbsp;– Scottish Branch: Balmoral Salutes a Retiring Legend |accessdate=7 October 2008|date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''QE2'' then sailed around Scotland to the [[Firth of Forth]] on 7 October 2008, where she anchored in the shadow of the [[Forth Bridge]]. The next day, following an [[RAF]] flypast, she left amidst a flotilla of small craft to head to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], before returning to Southampton.

[[File:QE2 Clyde 5 Oct 08 1157.jpg|thumb|Farewell to the Clyde]]

''QE2'' completed her final Atlantic crossing from New York to Southampton in tandem with her successor, ''QM2''. The two liners departed New York on 16 October and arrived in Southampton on 22 October. This marked the end of ''QE2''{{'}}s transatlantic voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-dubai/ |title=QE2 Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On her final arrival into Southampton, ''QE2'' (on 11 November 2008, with 1,700 passengers and 1,000 crew on board) ran [[aground]] in the [[Solent]] near the [[Southampton Water]] entrance at 5.26&amp;nbsp;am, on a triangular sandbank roughly equidistant between the mouth of Southampton Water and [[East Cowes]] named [[Bramble Bank]]. [[BBC]] reported &quot;[[Cunard Line|Cunard]] has confirmed it touched the bottom at the Brambles Turn [[sandbank]] (sandback) near [[Calshot]], [[Southampton Water]], with three tugs attached to her [[stern]] (0530 [[GMT]]). A fourth tug secured a line to the ship's [[Bow (ship)|bow]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5howpLVxZV1XpwNbNPrkW5WU90P4w ukpress.google.com, ''QE2'' runs aground on final tour] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solent Coastguard stated: &quot;Five tugs were sent out to assist her getting off the sandbank, and she was pulled off just before 6.10&amp;nbsp;am. She had been refloated and was under way under her own power and heading back to her berth in Southampton. She had only partially gone aground, and the tugs pulled her off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5128451.ece timesonline.co.uk, QE2 runs aground on farewell call to Southampton] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5g_Lc8wcuxJVmvIJGYE1uoC31HkfA ukpress.google.com, QE2 runs aground] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once safely back at her berth, preparations continued for her farewell celebrations. These were led by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] who toured the ship at great length. He visited areas of interest including the Engine Control Room. He also met with current and former crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/heritage/deheritageqe2/3838884.QE2_sails_away_on_tide_of_emotion/ |title=Sorry… |date=30 June 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120630172918/http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/heritage/deheritageqe2/3838884.QE2_sails_away_on_tide_of_emotion/ |archivedate=30 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, divers were sent down to inspect the hull for any possible damage caused by the vessel's earlier mishap&amp;nbsp;– none were found.

She was greeted with a fly-past from an [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Airbus A380]] jet and a huge fireworks display, while thousands of people gathered at the [[Port Rashid|Mina Rashid]], waving the flags of the [[Union Jack|United Kingdom]] and the [[Flag of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]]. Since her arrival in Dubai ''QE2'' has remained moored at [[Port Rashid]]. Shortly after her final passengers were disembarked, she was moved forward to the cargo area of the port, to free up the passenger terminal for other cruise vessels.

She was expected to be refurbished and berthed permanently at Nakheel's [[Palm Jumeirah]] as &quot;a luxury floating hotel, retail, museum and entertainment destination.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunard Press Release&quot; /&gt; The refurbishment planned to see ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' transformed into a tourist destination in Dubai;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7664539.stm |work=BBC News | title=QE2 makes last New York trip | date=10 October 2008 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|Global Economic Crisis]], ''QE2'' remained moored at [[Port Rashid]] awaiting a decision about her future.

''QE2'' remained an oceangoing vessel at this time, and as such, former Captain Ronald Warwick of ''QE2'' and the ''[[RMS Queen Mary 2|QM2]]'' and retired commodore of the [[Cunard Line]] was initially employed by [[V-Ships]], who managed ''QE2'' post the Cunard handed her over as the vessel's legal master,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2008/11/12/qe2_farewell_clifton_feature.shtml |title=Hampshire&amp;nbsp;– History&amp;nbsp;– A fond farewell to QE2 |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was replaced by other V-Ships captains over time as the ship remained idle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,3175.msg33788.html#msg33788 |title=QE2's Captain - William Cooper - and his crew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was anticipated that ''QE2'' would be moved to the [[Dubai Drydocks]] sometime in 2009 to begin a series of far-reaching refurbishments which would result in a conversion into a floating hotel; however, {{As of|2011|lc=on}}.

Due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 global recession]], fears have been sparked that ''QE2''{{'}}s refurbishment and hotel conversion would not take place and that the ship would be resold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4119668.Fears_that_QE2_could_be_cut_up_for_scrap/ |title=– Fears that QE2 could be cut up for scrap |website=Southampton Daily Echo |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/search/display.var.2489394.0.fears_grow_over_developers_bid_to_turn_qe2_into_a_hotel_in_dubai.php |title=Fears grow over developers bid to QE2 into a hotel |website=Glasgow Herald |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumours resulted in the owners, [[Istithmar]], issuing a series of press releases stating that plans for QE2's conversion are ongoing, with no intention to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/articles/1/34145/ |title=QE2 owners deny ship selloff&amp;nbsp;– Retrieved on 21 February 2009 |work=Clydebank Post|date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014838/http://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/articles/1/34145/ |archivedate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/4123549.No_intention_to_sell_QE2__say_owners/ |title=No Intention to Sell ''QE2'' |website=Southampton Daily Echo |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since arriving in Dubai the only visible exterior change to ''QE2'' was the painting out of the Cunard titles from the ship's superstructure.

''QE2'' was joined in [[Mina Rashid]] by ''QM2'' on Saturday, 21 March 2009 while ''QM2'' visited [[Dubai]] as part of her 2009 World Cruise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/chriscunard/15905077515/in/album-72157622194866138/ |title=QE2 in Dubai |website=Chris' Cunard Page on Flickr |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=29 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was joined once again by ''Queen Victoria'' on Sunday, 29 March 2009 as a part of her 2009 World Cruise.

In June 2009, the ''Southampton Daily Echo'' reported that ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' would return to the UK&lt;ref name=&quot;theqe2story.com&quot;&gt;http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,686.0.html |year=2009|accessdate=13 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as an operating [[Cruise Ship]]. However, on 20 July 2009 the owners [[Nakheel]] confirmed rumours that ''QE2'' will re position to Cape Town for use as a floating Hotel.

On 24 June 2009, ''QE2'' made her first journey after nearly eight months of inactivity since the liner arrived in Dubai. She manoeuvred under her own power into the Dubai Drydocks for inspection and hull repainting before her then planned voyage to Cape Town's [[V&amp;A Waterfront]] to serve there as a floating hotel for the [[FIFA World Cup 2010]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.xpress4me.com/news/uae/dubai/20014292.html |title=QE2 to move to Dubai Drydock |agency=Xpress News |date=23 July 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826064948/http://www.xpress4me.com/news/uae/dubai/20014292.html |archive-date=26 August 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2009, it was revealed that ''QE2'' might sail to Cape Town, South Africa, to become a floating hotel for use primarily during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], in a Dubai World sponsored venture at the [[V&amp;A Waterfront]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.maktoob.com/20090000007446/Nakheel_admits_QE2_may_leave_Dubai/Article.htm |title=Nakheel Admits QE2 May Leave Dubai |year=2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713172152/http://business.maktoob.com/20090000007446/Nakheel_admits_QE2_may_leave_Dubai/Article.htm |archivedate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,25771636-5014090,00.html |title=QE2 cruise ship may become floating hotel|year=2009|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by Nakheel on 20 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/8160146.stm |work=BBC News | title=QE2 to be moved to South Africa | date=20 July 2009 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for this expected voyage the ship was placed into the Dubai Dry-dock and underwent an extensive exterior refurbishment. During this refit, the ship's underwater hull was repainted and inspected.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theqe2story.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,872.0.html |year=2009|accessdate=9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the refit, ''QE2'' was registered under the flag of Vanuatu, and Port Vila was painted on her stern, replacing Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,962.0.html |title=QE2 under the flag of Vanuatu |year=2009|work=The Age |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 sale and relocation speculation===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth 2 at DryDock World Dubai in 2012.jpg|thumb|At Drydock World Dubai in 2012]]
In early 2010, due to the continued poor financial performance of Dubai World, there was much media speculation that ''QE2'', along with other assets owned by [[Istithmar]], Dubai World's private-equity arm, would be sold to raise capital. Despite this sale speculation, a number of alternative locations for QE2 have been cited including London, Singapore, [[Clydebank]],&lt;ref name=&quot;fremantlegazette&quot;/&gt; Japan&lt;ref name=&quot;fremantlegazette&quot;/&gt; and [[Fremantle]],&lt;ref name=&quot;fremantlegazette&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Freo-to-house-QE2/7560490/ |title=Freo to house QE2? |year=2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706041842/http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Freo-to-house-QE2/7560490/ |archive-date=6 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mirrorqe2freo&quot;/&gt; the latter showing interest in using QE2 as a hotel for the [[ISAF Sailing World Championships]] to be held in December 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;mirrorqe2freo&quot;/&gt; However, as at June 2010 Nakheel's official statement regarding QE2 is that &quot;a number of options being considered for QE2&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fremantlegazette&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mirrorqe2freo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/captain-greybeard/2010/07/new-hopes-for-two-old-girls.html |title=New hopes for two old girls |year=2010 |accessdate=2 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705175222/http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/captain-greybeard/2010/07/new-hopes-for-two-old-girls.html |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 drifting===
On 28 January 2011 during a heavy [[dust storm]], ''QE2'' broke loose from her moorings and drifted out into the channel at Port Rashid. She was attended by pilots and tugs and safely returned to berth at Port Rashid. Images of ''QE2'''s unexpected movements appeared on-line after being taken by an observer on the ship in front of QE2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,2857.msg32405.html#msg32405|title=QE2 mooring lines snap during Sandstorm!&amp;nbsp;– Friday 28 January |publisher=Theqe2story.com |accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warm layup===
Throughout 2011 and 2012, ''QE2'' remained berthed at Port Mina Rashid in Dubai {{As of|2011|alt=in 2011}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightbody1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/news/2010/index.htm |title= QE2, 2010 News |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was maintained in a seaworthy condition and generated her own power. Each of her nine diesel generators were turned over and used to power the ship. A live-in crew of approximately 50 people maintained ''QE2'' to a high standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightbody2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theqe2story.com/aboutQE2/QE2Today.html |title=The QE2 Story |accessdate=25 May 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717023027/http://theqe2story.com/aboutQE2/QE2Today.html |archivedate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities include painting, maintenance, cabin checks, and overhauls of machinery. Istithmar were considering plans for ''QE2'' which could have involved the ship sailing to an alternative location under her own power.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=lightbody1 /&gt;

On 21 March 2011, ''QM2'' called in Dubai and docked close to ''QE2''. During the departure, the two ships sounded their horns.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QE2 sounds her whistle to Queen Mary 2 in Dubai|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzZ21hR8DLI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 return to Liverpool plan, Port Rashid and ''QE2'' development plans===
[[File:QE2 and Ferry Too (3556981118).jpg|thumb|''QE2'' near the Cunard Building in Liverpool during her service with the cruise line]]
On 28 September 2011 news broke that a plan was being formulated to return QE2 to the United Kingdom by berthing her in Liverpool.&lt;ref name=&quot;liverpool&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/captain-greybeard/2011/09/a-liverpool-home-for-historic.html |title=A Liverpool home for historic liner QE2?

It was revealed that [[Liverpool Vision]], the economic development company responsible for Liverpool's regeneration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool Vision Homepage|url=http://www.liverpoolvision.co.uk/Default.aspx|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026191008/http://www.liverpoolvision.co.uk/Default.aspx|archivedate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been involved in confidential discussions with Out of Time Concepts, a company headed by a former Chief Engineer on the ship, who recently advised its current owners&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt; on plans to turn it into a luxury hotel in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;liverpool&quot; /&gt;

In a letter from Out of Time Concepts to Liverpool Vision, it is explained that &quot;The free global media attention derived from bringing home ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' will without question promote Liverpool's new waterfront developments, its amazing architecture, its maritime and world heritage sites, its museums, its culture and its history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;liverpool&quot; /&gt;

On the same week that the Liverpool Vision plans were revealed, Nakheel stated that plans for ''QE2'' to be berthed at The Palm had been dropped because they now planned to build 102 houses on the site which was once intended to be named the QE2 Precinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QE2 Palm Plan Sinks|url=http://dubai-waterfront.com/featured/796/qe2-palm-jumeirah-plan-sinks-as-nakheel-floats-townhouse-project-instead|access-date=13 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630142328/http://dubai-waterfront.com/featured/796/qe2-palm-jumeirah-plan-sinks-as-nakheel-floats-townhouse-project-instead|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Home for QE2|url=http://oceanlinersblog.org/?p=3008|access-date=2 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425013827/http://oceanlinersblog.org/?p=3008|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rebecca Bundhun |url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/qe2-palm-jumeirah-plan-out-as-nakheel-floats-townhouse-project-instead |title=QE2 Palm Jumeirah plan out as Nakheel floats townhouse project instead&amp;nbsp;– The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422212117/http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/qe2-palm-jumeirah-plan-out-as-nakheel-floats-townhouse-project-instead |archivedate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakheel suggested that ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', under the ownership of Istithmar, would remain at Port Rashid to become an integral part of the growing cruise terminal. &quot;The ''QE2'' would be placed in a much better location&quot;, Ali Rashid Lootah, the chairman of Nakheel, told Dubai's The National newspaper &quot;The Government of Dubai is developing an up-to-date modern cruise terminal which will mean a better environment&quot;, confirming the ship would remain in Dubai for the foreseeable future.

===July 2012: Hotel announcement===
On 2 July 2012 in a coordinated press release, the ship's owner, operator and Port Rashid operator, DP Ports, jointly announced ''QE2'' would re-open as a 300-bed hotel after an 18-month refit. The release claims the ship was to be refitted to restore original features, including her 1994–2008 'Heritage Trail' of classic Cunard artefacts. The ship was to be berthed alongside a redeveloped Port Rashid cruise terminal which would double as a maritime museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps.dpworld.com/portal/page/portal/DP_WORLD_WEBSITE/Media-Centre/News-Releases/News-Releases-2012/2%207%20QE2%20Port%20Rashid%20plans%20final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722050502/https://webapps.dpworld.com/portal/page/portal/DP_WORLD_WEBSITE/Media-Centre/News-Releases/News-Releases-2012/2%207%20QE2%20Port%20Rashid%20plans%20final.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2012 }} QE2 press release 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrapping in China, ''QE2'' London and ''QE2'' Asia===
On 23 December 2012, it was reported that ''QE2'' had been sold for scrapping in China for £20 million, after a bid to return her to the UK was rejected. With monthly berthing and maintenance charges of £650,000, it was reported that a Chinese salvage crew arrived at the vessel on 21 December, to replace a crew of 40 which has been maintaining the vessel since it arrived at Port Rashid.&lt;ref name=Otago240912&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/business/240912/reported-sale-qe2-ship-breakers-sad-news|title=Reported sale of ''QE2'' to ship-breakers sad news|author=Doug Wright|work=Otago Daily Times|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cunard dismissed the reports as &quot;pure speculation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunard Facebook&quot;&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/cunard/posts/10151389239703223 CUNARD status update].

The &quot;''QE2'' London&quot; Plan had included a £20 million bid for ''QE2'' and a further £40 million refurbishment that was supposed to create more than 2,000 jobs in London, with ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' docked near the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]]. It had reportedly obtained the support of the then London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;savetheqe2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Queen Elizabeth 2.jpg|thumb|''QE2'' in Dubai with ''Cunard'' titles removed from her superstructure]]

On 17 January 2013, the Dubai Drydocks World announced that ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' would be sent to an unknown location in Asia to serve as a floating luxury hotel, shopping mall, and museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savetheqe2.info/qe2_hotel_asia.php|title=Save the QE2: QE2 Hotel|accessdate=22 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602041152/http://savetheqe2.info/qe2_hotel_asia.php|archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this move, the QE2 London team stated on the same day that &quot;We believe our investors can show Dubai that ''QE2'' London is still the best proposal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-dubai/|title=QE2 Today|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunard's 175 anniversary celebrations on 25 May 2015 led to renewed interest in ''Queen Elizabeth 2''.

[[Inverclyde Council]] leader Stephen McCabe has called on the UK and Scottish governments to campaign to buy the ship, saying that &quot;Bringing the ''QE2'' home is a Herculean task, one that requires national support in Scotland and perhaps across the UK, if it has any chance of happening.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christison|first1=Greg|title=Herculean effort to save the QE2 from a sorry end in Dubai|url=http://www.express.co.uk/scotland/581820/Queen-Elizabeth-Dubai-Scotland-ship-save|accessdate=29 August 2015|publisher=Scottish Express|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016 Aubrey Fawcett, the chair of the working group to regenerate the Clyde, admitted defeat in this effort as ''QE2's'' owners refused to respond to any requests regarding her condition or sale. ''&quot;Consequently, we must conclude that it is highly unlikely that Scotland features in the future plans for the vessel.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;CLYDE&quot;/&gt;

===''Queen Elizabeth 2'' movements in 2015===
On 12 August 2015, the QE2 was observed to have been moved from her berth within Dubai Dry Docks, where she had been since January 2013, to a more open location within Port Rashid. On 17 November 2015, QE2 was again moved within Port Rashid, to the former cruise terminal. It is not known whether these recent moves are connected with any of the publicly known plans regarding the ships fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,7066.0.html|title=Positions of QE2 since 26.11.2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 removal of lifeboats and davits===
Between May and August 2016, observers noted that the ship's lifeboats were lowered and stored on a nearby car park. Following this, the lifeboat [[davit]]s were removed in September, giving the ship an altered profile on her boat deck. Subsequently, the wooden decking has been removed from this deck and replaced by synthetic block flooring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theqe2story.com/forum/index.php/topic,7341.0.html|title=Lifeboats/Davits Removal 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://maritimematters.com/2017/01/hotel-ships-and-qe2-preservation-versus-practicalities/ | title=Hotel Ships and QE2 – Preservation versus Practicalities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

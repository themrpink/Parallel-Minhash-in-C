The Hall of Fame announced that the following members were included as inductees: Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Rod Evans, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Excluded from induction were Nick Simper, Tommy Bolin, Joe Lynn Turner, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse and Don Airey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-singer-rock-hall-band-member-exclusions-are-very-silly-20151221 |title=Deep Purple Singer: Rock Hall Band Member Exclusions Are 'Very Silly' |publisher=rollingstone.com |last=Reed |first=Ryan |date=21 December 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the induction ceremony, Ian Gillan announced that he was barring Hughes, Coverdale, Evans and Blackmore from playing with them onstage, as these members are not in the current &quot;living, breathing&quot; version of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ian-gillan-deep-purple-rock-hall/|title=Ian Gillan Comments on Deep Purple's Decision to Perform With Current Lineup at Rock Hall Induction|website=Ultimateclassicriock.com|accessdate=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven living inducted members, five showed up. Blackmore didn't attend; a posting on his Facebook page claimed he was honoured by the induction and had considered attending, until he received correspondence from Bruce Payne, manager from the current touring version of Deep Purple saying, &quot;No!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-guitarist-ritchie-blackmore-wont-attend-hall-of-fame-ceremony-20160219 |title=Deep Purple Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore Won't Attend Hall of Fame Ceremony |website=Rollingstone.com |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews at the Rock Hall, however, Gillan insisted he personally invited Blackmore to attend, but not to play onstage. Evans, who had disappeared from the music scene more than three decades prior, also didn't appear. Since Lord had died in 2012, his wife Vickie accepted his award on his behalf. The current members of the band played &quot;[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]&quot; for the opening performance. After a brief interlude playing the [[Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s]] song &quot;[[Green Onions]]&quot; while photos of the late Jon Lord flashed on the screen behind them, the current Deep Purple members played two more songs: &quot;[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]&quot; and their signature tune &quot;[[Smoke on the Water]]&quot;. Although barred from playing with Deep Purple, both David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (as well as Roger Glover) joined fellow inductees [[Cheap Trick]] and an all-star cast to perform a cover of the [[Fats Domino]] song &quot;[[Ain't That a Shame]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016 RHOF&quot;&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-rocks-hall-of-fame-with-hits-filled-set-20160408 &quot;Deep Purple Rocks Hall of Fame With Hits-Filled Set&quot;].

{{Chinese democracy movement}}
{{Contemporary Chinese political thought}}
The '''Chinese democracy movement'''{{efn|{{zh|s=中国民主运动|t=中國民主運動|p=Zhōngguó mínzhǔ yùndòng}}}} (abbreviated '''Minyun'''{{efn|{{zh|s=民运|t=民運|p=Mínyùn}}}}) refers to a series of loosely organized [[political movement]]s in the [[People's Republic of China]] against the continued [[one-party state|one-party rule]] by the [[Communist Party of China]]. One such movement began during the [[Beijing Spring]] in November 1978 and was taken up again in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://pekinger-fruehling.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=188844&amp;L=2 | title=Die chinesische Demokratiebewegung 1978 bis 1981 -– Erinnerungen der damaligen Akteure » the Democracy Movement 1978-1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Democracy in China}}
The origin of the Chinese movement started in 1978, when the brief [[liberalization]] known as [[Beijing Spring]] occurred after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The founding document of the movement is considered to be [[The Fifth Modernization]] manifesto by [[Wei Jingsheng]], who was sentenced to fifteen years in [[prison]] for authoring the document. In it, Wei argued that political liberalization and the empowerment of the laboring masses was essential for modernization, that the Communist Party was controlled by reactionaries and that the people must struggle to overthrow the reactionaries via a long and possibly bloody fight.

Throughout the 1980s, these ideas increased in popularity among college-educated Chinese. In response to growing [[Political corruption|corruption]], economic dislocation and the sense that reforms in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] were leaving China behind, the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] erupted in 1989. These protests were put down by government troops on June 4, 1989. In response, a number of pro-[[democracy]] organizations were formed by overseas Chinese [[Student activism|student activists]], and there was considerable sympathy for the movement among Westerners, who formed the [[China Support Network]] (CSN).

While the CSN was initially a go-to organization for U.S. mainstream news media (MSM) to cite, CSN and MSM parted company in a dispute over the casualty count from the June 4 massacre. MSM originally reported 3,000 dead. On June 22, 1989, {{lang|fr|[[Agence France-Presse]]}} referred to &quot;the Chinese army's assault on the demonstrators in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, an operation in which U.S. intelligence sources estimated ''3,000 people were killed.''&quot; That casualty count, originally reported as above, was subsequently changed by the news media. CSN reported that it was in the interest of China's propaganda minister to reduce the casualty count by an order of magnitude, resulting in later reports that &quot;hundreds&quot; were killed at Tiananmen Square. In November, 1989, CSN editor James W. Hawkins MD wrote, &quot;It appears as if Mr. [[Yuan Mu]] [Chinese State Council spokesman] has gotten his way and when we read reports on the AP wire we are told exactly what Mr. Mu [''sic''] wants us to read.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The rift between CSN and MSM plays into the history of the movement. In January, 2005, upon the death of ousted Communist Party [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Zhao Ziyang]], CSN raised its estimate to 3,001 dead in the Tiananmen crackdown. CSN proceeded to be critical of the MSM, and MSM proceeded to minimize, downplay, ignore or underreport movement news and China's human rights abuse.{{PROV-statement|date=March 2010}}

==Current situation==
This could be in part the result of the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] tightening its control over its people's freedom of speech, thus giving the appearance of disinterest, or as a result of the overall economic and social reforms China has undertaken in recent years. The difficulties that the [[Soviet Union]] had in converting to democracy and [[capitalism]] were used to validate the PRC's official position that slow gradual reform was a wise policy. Structurally, democracy promotion organizations in the United States such as the China Alliance for Democracy, the [[Federation for a Democratic China]] and the [[Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars]] suffered from internal disputes and infighting. Much support was lost over the issues of [[Most Favored Nation]] trade status and China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]], which was popular both within and outside of China, but which was opposed by 79% of the American people (in a poll published by Business Week) and the overseas democracy movement. After [[Xi Jinping]] succeeded [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in 2012, [[human rights in China]] have become worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2120318/human-rights-china-under-xi-jinping-worst-tiananmen|title=Human rights in China under Xi Jinping 'worst since Tiananmen crackdown': Amnesty|work=[[Amnesty International]]|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|language=en|date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Censorship in the People's Republic of China|Censorship in Mainland China]] is very strict, including [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|in the Internet]]. The new generation finds it difficult to obtain, or are unaware of, the truth regarding several important historical events which occurred before they were born.

A [[generation gap]] began to appear between older and younger students when people born after the [[Cultural Revolution]] began entering college campuses. These students perceived the older activists as more pro-American than pro-democracy, and thus they are far more supportive of the Communist Party. The younger students also tend to be more nationalistic. Internal disputes within the movement over issues such as China's [[most-favored nation]] status in U.S. trade law crippled the movement, as did the perception by many within China that overseas [[dissident]]s such as [[Harry Wu]] and [[Wei Jingsheng]] were simply out of touch with the growing economic prosperity and decreasing political control within China.

==Government response==
[[Ideology|Ideologically]], the government's first reaction to the democracy movement was an effort to focus on the personal behavior of individual dissidents and argue that they were tools of foreign powers. In the mid-1990s, the government began using more effective arguments which were influenced by [[Neoconservatism in the People's Republic of China|Chinese Neo-Conservatism]] and Western authors such as [[Edmund Burke]]. The main argument was that China's main priority was [[economic growth]], and economic growth required political stability. The democracy movement was flawed because it promoted [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]ism and [[revolution]] which put the gains that China had made into jeopardy. In contrast to Wei's argument that democracy was essential to [[economic growth]], the government argued that economic growth must come before political liberalization, comparable to what happened in the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

With regard to [[political dissent]] engendered by the movement, the government has taken a three-pronged approach. First, dissidents who are widely known in the West such as [[Wei Jingsheng]], [[Fang Lizhi]], and [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] are deported. Although Chinese [[criminal law]] does not contain any provisions for [[exile|exiling]] citizens, these deportations are conducted by giving the dissident a severe jail sentence and then granting medical [[parole]]. Second, the less well-known leaders of a dissident movement are identified and given severe jail sentences. Generally, the government targets a relatively small number of organizers who are crucial in coordinating a movement and who are then charged with endangering [[national security|state security]] or revealing official secrets. Thirdly, the government attempts to address the grievances of possible supporters of the movement. This is intended to isolate the leadership of the movement, and prevent disconnected [[protest]]s from combining into a general organized protest that can threaten the Communist hold on power.

===Chinese socialist democracy===
[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leaders assert there are already elements of democracy; they dubbed the term &quot;Chinese socialist democracy&quot; for what they describe as a participatory representative government. In a November 23, 2002 interview, the Chinese ambassador to [[Egypt]], Liu Xiaoming, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think what we are practicing today is Chinese socialist democracy, which is represented by the National People's Congress and a broad participation of the Chinese people. In fact, in today's China, the political participation at the grassroots level is much higher than any western country you can name of. We have grassroots level democracy demonstrated by village election. The turnout is 99 percent, i.e. 99% of villagers participating in this political process to elect their village leaders, comparing with only less than 50% of participation in election process in many western countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://big5.fmprc.gov.cn/gate/big5/eg.china-embassy.org/eng/dsxx/cfyj/2002/t77035.htm Interview with Ambassador Liu Xiaoming On Nile TV International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111065440/http://big5.fmprc.gov.cn/gate/big5/eg.china-embassy.org/eng/dsxx/cfyj/2002/t77035.htm |date=January 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern democracy activism==
Many pro-democracy supporters noted that China has successfully overcome many of the challenges to [[democracy in China]] faced during the transition from a communist to a capitalist economy, so there is no longer a need for prolonged political repression. They claim that pro-democracy forces would not necessarily stall economic growth after the transition, as the Communist Party states, and more importantly that the presence of democracy would help to check wasteful corruption and might achieve a more even distribution of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Many believe that the Communist Party of China has no intention whatsoever of ever relinquishing power even if all their economic goals are ever achieved; it is said that China would have refused the WTO if the terms of entry were linked to a shift to a Western-style democracy.

Within China, most protest activity now is expressed in single-issue demonstrations, which are tolerated to a degree by the government. Some of the ideas of the movement have been incorporated in the Chinese liberal faction who tend to agree with [[Neoconservatism in China|neoconservative]]s that stability is important, but argue that political liberalization is essential to maintain stability. In contrast to democracy movement activists, most members of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] faction do not overtly call for the overthrow of the Communist Party nor do they deny the possibility of reform from within the Party. As a result, members of the liberal faction are generally enjoying more official tolerance than persons who identify themselves as members of the democracy movement.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

'''Opeth''' is a Swedish [[progressive metal]]/[[progressive rock|rock]] band from [[Stockholm]], formed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/interview-mikael-akerfeldt-opeth-283778|last=Laing|first=Rob|title=Interview: Mikael Åkerfeldt, Opeth|publisher=Music Radar|date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.astra-berlin.de/events/2016-11-24-opeth|title=Astra Berlin - OPETH|website=www.astra-berlin.de|date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been through several personnel changes, including the replacement of every single original member. Lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] has remained Opeth's primary driving force since the departure of original vocalist [[David Isberg]] in 1992. Opeth has consistently incorporated [[progressive metal|progressive]], [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[classical music|classical]], and [[jazz]] influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from [[death metal]], especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] shifts, as well as demonic vocal characterization. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of [[Mellotron]]s in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums, but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', they have led several major world tours.

Opeth has released 13 studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album ''[[Orchid (album)|Orchid]]'' in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, ''[[Ghost Reveries]]'', was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, ''[[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]]'', which peaked at No. 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. As of November 2009, Opeth has sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opethfanclub.se/Page/Article/Article.aspx?articleID=71 |title=The Man, The Myth, The Manager! |publisher= Opeth Fan Club Sweden |date= November 13, 2009 |access-date=May 12, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405184757/http://www.opethfanclub.se/Page/Article/Article.aspx?articleID=71 |archive-date= April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 300,000 collective [[SoundScan]]s of their albums ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', ''[[Damnation (album)|Damnation]]'', and ''[[Deliverance (Opeth album)|Deliverance]]'' in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://purerocknews.com/opeth-release-four-album-reissues-and-continue-tour-with-mastodon/ |publisher= Pure Rock News |title= Opeth Release Four Album Reissues and Continue Tour With Mastodon |date= May 2, 2012 |accessdate= May 12, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180315135128/http://purerocknews.com/opeth-release-four-album-reissues-and-continue-tour-with-mastodon/ |archive-date= March 15, 2018 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation (1989–1993)===
[[File:Mikael Åkerfeldt 2005 by JeroenMassar.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Åkerfeldt (pictured) and Isberg decided they would carry on with the band after most of the members had gone separate ways.]]

Opeth was formed as a [[death metal]] band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist [[David Isberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 2008 |author= McIver, Joel |title= Pressing the Red Button |journal= [[Metal Hammer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band name was derived from the word &quot;Opet&quot;, taken from the [[Wilbur Smith]] novel ''[[The Sunbird]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furteeng&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Watt, Erika Kristen |date=July 5, 2005 |url=http://www.fourteeng.net/opeth.html |title=Interview Mikael Åkerfeldt |publisher=Furteeng.net |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604023601/http://www.fourteeng.net/opeth.html |archive-date=June 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional [[Phoenicia]]n city in South Africa translated as &quot;City of the Moon&quot;.

In 1990, Isberg asked former Eruption band member [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]], who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt;

Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer [[Anders Nordin]], bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124065223/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter2.html |archive-date=January 24, 2008 |title=Opeth chapter 2 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist [[Johan De Farfalla]]. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend [[Peter Lindgren (musician)|Peter Lindgren]] took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing &quot;creative differences&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt;

Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the [[blast beat]]s and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated [[acoustic guitar]]s and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with [[Candlelight Records]] in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he went on to join on a full-time basis following the release of Opeth's debut album, &quot;Orchid&quot;, in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;/&gt;

Opeth recorded its debut album, ''[[Orchid (album)|Orchid]]'', with producer [[Dan Swanö]] in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=DaRonco, Mike |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p214051|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music Opeth Bio |website=Allmusic |accessdate=March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orchid'' tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Serba, John |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r277899|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Orchid'' review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

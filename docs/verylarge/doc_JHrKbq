'''Mono Lake''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|MOH|noh}}) is a [[Salt lake|saline]] [[soda lake]] in [[Mono County, California]], formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in an [[endorheic basin]]. The lack of an outlet causes [[Hypersaline lake|high levels of salts]] to accumulate in the lake and make its water [[alkalinity|alkaline]].

The desert lake has an unusually productive [[ecosystem]] based on [[brine shrimp]], which thrive in its waters, and provides critical habitat for two million annual migratory birds that feed on the shrimp and alkali flies (''[[Ephydra hians]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;mlcbirds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds of the Basin: the Migratory Millions of Mono|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/ecobirds|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H0S6fR6x?url=http://www.monolake.org/about/ecobirds|archive-date=2013-05-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carle&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Water in California|last=Carle|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=0-520-24086-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780520240865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the native [[Kucadikadi|Kutzadika'a]] people ate the alkali flies' pupae, which live in the shallow waters around the edge of the lake. 
When the city of [[Los Angeles]] diverted water from the freshwater streams flowing into the lake, it lowered the lake level, which imperiled the [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds. The [[Mono Lake Committee]] formed in response and won a legal battle that forced Los Angeles to partially replenish the lake level.

==Geology==
Mono Lake occupies part of the [[Mono Basin]], an [[endorheic basin]] that has no outlet to the ocean. Dissolved salts in the runoff thus remain in the lake and raise the water's [[pH]] levels and salt concentration. The [[List of rivers of California#Mono Lake|tributaries of Mono Lake]] include [[Lee Vining Creek]], [[Rush Creek (Mono County, California)|Rush Creek]] and [[Mill Creek (Mono Lake)|Mill Creek]] which flows through Lundy Canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|263070|Lundy Canyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basin was formed by geological forces over the last five million years: [[basin and range]] crustal stretching and associated [[volcanism]] and faulting at the base of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|45}} Five million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was an eroded set of rolling hills and Mono Basin and Owens Valley did not yet exist.

From 4.5 to 2.6 million years ago, large volumes of [[basalt]] were extruded around what is now Cowtrack Mountain (east and south of Mono Basin); eventually covering {{convert|300|sqmi|km2}} and reaching a maximum thickness of {{convert|600|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|45}} Later volcanism in the area occurred 3.8 million to 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|46}} This activity was northwest of Mono Basin and included the formation of Aurora Crater, Beauty Peak, Cedar Hill (later an island in the highest stands of Mono Lake), and Mount Hicks.

Mono Lake is believed to have formed at least 760,000 years ago, dating back to the [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley eruption]]. Sediments located below the ash layer hint that Mono Lake could be a remnant of a larger and older lake that once covered a large part of [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], which would put it among the oldest lakes in North America. At its height during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]], the lake would have been about {{convert|900|ft|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris2005p61&quot;/&gt; Prominent old shore lines, called [[strandline]]s by geologists, can be seen west of the Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/long_valley/long_valley_sub_page_16.html|title=Mono Lake|work=Long Valley Caldera Field Guide|publisher=USGS|access-date=2015-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229114402/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/long_valley/long_valley_sub_page_16.html|archive-date=2014-12-29|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Mono Lake is in a geologically active area at the north end of the [[Mono–Inyo Craters]] volcanic chain and is close to [[Long Valley Caldera]]. Volcanic activity continues in the Mono Lake vicinity: the most recent eruption occurred 350 years ago, resulting in the formation of [[Paoha Island]]. [[Panum Crater]] (on the south shore of the lake) is an example of a combined [[rhyolite]] [[Lava dome|dome]] and [[cinder cone]].

== Tufa towers ==
Many columns of [[limestone]] rise above the surface of Mono Lake. These limestone towers consist primarily of [[calcium]] [[carbonate]] minerals such as [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub href=&quot;endorheic basin&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This type of limestone rock is referred to as [[tufa]], which is a term used for limestone that forms in low to moderate temperatures.

=== Tufa tower formation ===
Mono Lake is a highly alkaline lake, or [[soda lake]]. [[Alkalinity]] is a measure of how many [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] are in a [[solution]], and how well the solution can neutralize [[acid]]s. [[Carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub href=&quot;Los Angeles&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup href=&quot;Bird migration&quot;&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are both bases. Hence, Mono Lake has a very high content of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]]. Through supply of [[calcium]] ions (Ca&lt;sup href=&quot;endorheic basin&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), the water will precipitate [[Calcium carbonate|carbonate-minerals]] such as [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub href=&quot;Lee Vining Creek&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Subsurface waters enter the bottom of Mono Lake through small springs. High concentrations of dissolved calcium ions in these subsurface waters cause huge amounts of calcite to precipitate around the spring orifices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:72&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=James|date=1953|title=The origin of the deposits of tufa in Mono Lake|url=|journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology|volume=23|pages=18–23|doi=10.1306/d4269530-2b26-11d7-8648000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tufa originally formed at the bottom of the lake. It took many decades or even centuries to form the well-recognized tufa towers. When lake levels fell, the tufa towers came to rise above the water surface and stand as the majestic pillars seen today (see Lake Level History for more information).

=== Tufa morphology ===
[[File:Thinolite_sketches.png|thumb|upright=0.8|These are original sketches of thinolite made by Edward S. Dana from his book from 1884: ''Crystallographic Study of the Thinolite of Lake Lahontan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot;&gt;Dana, E. S. (1884). A crystallographic study of the thinolite of Lake Lahontan (No. 12). ''Govt. Print. Off.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]Description of the Mono Lake tufa dates back to the 1880s, when [[Edward Salisbury Dana|Edward S. Dana]] and [[Israel Russell|Israel C. Russell]] made the first systematic descriptions of the Mono Lake tufa.&lt;ref&gt;Rusell, I. C. (1889). Quaternary history of Mono Valley, California: ''U. S. Geol. Survey 8th Ann. Rept. for 1886- 1887'', 261-394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot;/&gt; The tufa occurs as &quot;modern&quot; tufa towers. However, there are tufa sections from old shorelines, when the lake levels were higher. These pioneering works in tufa morphology are still referred to by researchers today and were confirmed by James R. Dunn in 1953. The tufa types can roughly be divided into three main categories based on morphology:&lt;ref name=&quot;:72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, I. C. (1883). Sketch of the geological history of Lake Lahontan: ''U. S. Geol. Survey 3rd Ann. Rept. for 1881-1882'', 189-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lithoid tufa - massive and porous with a rock-like appearance
*Dendritic tufa - branching structures that look similar to small shrubs
*Thinolitic tufa - large well-formed crystals of several centimeters

These tufa types vary interchangeably both between individual tufa towers but also within individual tufa towers. There can be multiple transitions between tufa morphologies within a single tufa tower.

Through time, many hypotheses were developed regarding the formation of the large [https://www.mindat.org/min-11409.html thinolite] crystals (also referred to as [https://www.mindat.org/min-27112.html glendonite]) in thinolitic tufa. It was relatively clear that the thinolites represented a calcite [[pseudomorph]] after some unknown original [[crystal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:82&quot;/&gt; However, the original crystal was only determined when the mineral [[ikaite]] was discovered in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly, H. (1963). &quot; Ikaite&quot;, a New Mineral from Greenland. ''Arctic'', ''16''(4), 263-264.&lt;/ref&gt; Ikaite, or hexahydrated CaCO&lt;sub href=&quot;strandline&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is [[Metastability|metastable]] and only crystallizes at near-freezing temperatures. It is also believed that calcite crystallization inhibitors such as [[phosphate]], [[magnesium]], and [[organic carbon]] may aid in the stabilization of ikaite.&lt;ref&gt;Council, T. C., &amp; Bennett, P. C. (1993). Geochemistry of ikaite formation at Mono Lake, California: Implications for the origin of tufa mounds. ''Geology'', ''21''(11), 971-974.&lt;/ref&gt; When heated, ikaite breaks down and becomes replaced by smaller crystals of calcite.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, D. J., McGugan, A., Stein, C., &amp; Smith, A. J. (1989). Ikaite, CaCO3̇6H2O, precursor of the thinolites in the Quaternary tufas and tufa mounds of the Lahontan and Mono Lake Basins, western United States. ''Geological Society of America Bulletin'', ''101''(7), 913-917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swainson, I. P., &amp; Hammond, R. P. (2001). Ikaite, CaCO3· 6H2O: Cold comfort for glendonites as paleothermometers. ''American Mineralogist'', ''86''(11-12), 1530-1533.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ikka Fjord of [[Greenland]], ikaite was also observed to grow in columns similar to the tufa towers of Mono Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Buchardt, B., Israelson, C., Seaman, P., &amp; Stockmann, G. (2001). Ikaite tufa towers in Ikka Fjord, southwest Greenland: their formation by mixing of seawater and alkaline spring water. ''Journal of Sedimentary Research'', ''71''(1), 176-189.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led scientists to believe that thinolitic tufa is an indicator of [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] in Mono Lake because they reflect very cold temperatures.

=== Tufa chemistry ===
Rusell (1883) studied the chemical composition of the different tufa types in [[Lake Lahontan]], a large [[Pleistocene]] system of multiple lakes in California, Nevada, and Oregon. Not surprisingly, it was found that the tufas consisted primarily of [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub href=&quot;File:Mono Lake Tufa.JPG&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. However, they also contain minor constituents of [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] (~2 wt%), [[Iron oxide|Fe/Al-oxides]] (.25-1.29 wt%), and [[Phosphorus oxide|PO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] (0.3 wt%).

==== Carbon and oxygen isotopes ====
[[File:D18O_of_Mono_Lake.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The red line represents the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of a water mixture between lake water and riverine freshwater that depends on the fraction of lake water to riverine freshwater.]]
[[Isotopes of carbon|Carbon]] and [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen]] isotopic compositions of Mono Lake tufas have the potential to reveal many interesting things about how water bodies mix in Mono Lake, how the climate changed throughout time in the [[Mono Basin]], and how biology may or may not play a role in tufa formation. Steps have been made to understand the isotopic compositions of &quot;modern&quot; tufa and water isotopic composition in Mono Lake.

Mono lake water [[Total inorganic carbon|DIC]] has a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition of 2 ‰&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Peng, T.-H. and Broecker, W. (1980). Gas exchange rates for three closed-basin lakes. ''Limmol. Oceanogr., 25,'' 789-796.&lt;/ref&gt; (relative to PDB), and a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of -0.1 ‰ (relative to SMOW).&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;&gt;Li., H.-C., Ku, T.-L., Stott, L. D. and Anderson, R. F. (1997). Stable isotope studies on Mono Lake (California). 1. d18O in lake sediments as proxy for climatic change during the last 150 years. ''Limmol. Oceanogr., 42,'' 230-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding rivers feeding into Mono Lake have a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of -14 to -17.5 ‰ and contains [[Total inorganic carbon|DIC]] with a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition of -14 ‰ .&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;/&gt; We observe that both the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of Mono Lake are enriched compared to surrounding water. One explanation for the enrichment of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in Mono Lake water is [[evaporation]]. The lighter isotope (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) will preferentially be evaporated, leaving more of the heavier isotope (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) behind.

It is also important to note that tufa forms from a mixture between lake water and subsurface waters. Because the streams surrounding Mono Lake are [[Isotopic signature|depleted]] in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compared to the lake water, combining the two sources will result in a water mixture that is more depleted than lake water. The figure above shows how δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of a water mixture changes with the fraction of lake water component. As the fraction of lake water decreases, the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;Li, H.-C. and Ku, T.-L. (1997). δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C- δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O covariance as a paleohydrological indicator for closed-basin lakes. ''Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 133'', 69-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carbonate hardness|total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration]] (ΣCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is much higher in the lake than in surrounding streams. Hence, this isotopic dilution effect is less significant for δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and water mixtures should be dominantly composed of δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C with lake water signatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;/&gt; In theory, Mono Lake tufa should have a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition reflecting the Mono lake water DIC composition, and a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition reflecting a mixture between Mono Lake and surrounding riverine water. This is only if we assume that the subsurface waters have similar compositions to riverine water.

There is also a temperature-dependent fractionation between Mono Lake water and precipitating carbonates. The [[Clumped isotopes|clumped isotope]] composition (Δ47, representing the amount of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O in the carbonate) of Mono Lake tufa are 0.734-0.735 ‰.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; The temperature and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of the corresponding water from which the tufa formed can be calculated using these Δ47-values&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S.T., O'Neil, J.R., 1997. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium oxygen isotope effects in synthetic carbonates. ''Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61'', 3461-3475.&lt;/ref&gt; From these values, it is calculated that Mono Lake tufa formed at a temperature of ~15&amp;nbsp;°C in water. For δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, the calcite-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O fractionation is given by:

ε = 18.03(1000/T)-32.42&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S. T., &amp; ONeil, J. R. (1997). Temperature dependence of 18O. ''Geochimica Cosmochima Acta'', ''61'', 3461-3475.&lt;/ref&gt; ~ -30‰ (SMOW)

For δ13C, the calcite-DIC fractionation is roughly given by:

ε ~ 1-2 ‰ (PDB) at 25&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot;&gt;Chacko, T., Cole, D. R., &amp; Horita, J. (2001). Equilibrium oxygen, hydrogen and carbon isotope fractionation factors applicable to geologic systems. ''Reviews in mineralogy and geochemistry'', ''43''(1), 1-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcite-aragonite fractionation is roughly given by:

ε ~ 2.7 ‰ (PDB) at 25&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot; /&gt;

However, these fractionation effects do not account for [[salinity]]-dependency.

The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of modern tufas are 28-32.5‰, which reflects a corresponding water mixture composition of -2‰ to 2‰.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD dissertation|last=Nielsen|first=Laura|date=2012|title=Kinetic isotope and trace element partitioning during calcite precipitation from aqueous solution|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0ae/fa68de6cabe1f5249343a7d69160a620db52.pdf?_ga=2.209554897.290846480.1574026794-53808657.1574026794|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|s2cid=92910167|accessdate=2019-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117220605/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0ae/fa68de6cabe1f5249343a7d69160a620db52.pdf%3F_ga%3D2.209554897.290846480.1574026794-53808657.1574026794|archivedate=2019-11-17|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; This range is similar to the composition of a mixture between Mono Lake and riverine waters. However, this mixture appears to be largely dominated by Mono Lake water.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Mono lake tufa have δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values that range from 5-8 for tufa of [[Aragonite|aragonitic]] composition&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; and 7-9‰ for tufa of [[Calcite|calcitic]] composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;Horton, T. W., Defliese, W. F., Tripati, A. K., &amp; Oze, C. (2016). Evaporation induced 18 O and 13 C enrichment in lake systems: a global perspective on hydrologic balance effects. ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', ''131'', 365-379.&lt;/ref&gt; These tufas are a little enriched compared to modern lake water DIC.  As stated above, calcite/aragonite-DIC fractionation can only explain an enrichment of 1-3‰ compared to lake water, i.e. a tufa composition of 3-5‰. The reason for this small δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C enrichment of tufa is still unclear and requires follow-up studies. It could be related to changes in DIC composition of Mono Lake, riverine water, and subsurface water compositions in the immediate past, which in turn could be related to climate or biological productivity in the lake. However, it could also be related to the fact that the isotopic composition of the subsurface waters that flow into Mono Lake is not well understood. These subsurface waters may have a very different composition compared to both Mono Lake waters and riverine surface waters. In addition, secondary crystallization (e.g. formation of calcite from aragonite) or meteoric diagenetic effects could have some control on the isotopic composition as well. Lastly, scientists may have to revisit the salinity-dependency of calcite/aragonite-DIC fractionation to understand whether this 1-3‰ fractionation may actually be larger in a lake with conditions similar to Mono Lake.

[[File:Lake_stands_and_isotopes.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a closed lake system like Mono Lake, coupled evaporation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-degassing progresses will cause the lake water δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C (carbon and oxygen isotopes) to increase. During stable low stands or high stands, there is no correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O. Importantly, a transformation to an open lake system may also cause δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O to become uncorrelated. Following increased precipitation and surface runoff, the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C will decrease.]]
An important characteristic of Mono Lake is that it is a [[Open and closed lakes|closed lake]]. This means that water does not flow out of the surface of the lake. Water can only escape the lake if it [[Evaporation|evaporates]] or is lost to [[groundwater]]. This may cause closed lakes to become very [[Salinity|saline.]] The lake level of closed lakes will be strongly dependent on [[Climate change|changes in climate]]. Hence, studying lake levels can reveal information about climate change in the past and present. Geochemists have observed that [[Carbonate rock|carbonates]] from closed lakes appear to have δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O (carbon and oxygen isotopes) with covariant trends.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Talbot, M. R. (1990). A review of the palaeohydrological interpretation of carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in primary lacustrine carbonates. ''Chemical Geology'', 80, 261-279.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this [[Covariance|covariation]] occurs because of coupled [[evaporation]] and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[degassing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;/&gt; The lighter isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, will preferentially go to the gas phase with increased evaporation. As a result, δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in the remaining lake both become increasingly heavy. Other factors such as biology, atmospheric properties, and freshwater compositions and flow may also influence δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Li|first=H.-C.|date=1995|title=Isotope Geochemistry of Mono Lake, California: applications to paleoclimate and paleohydrology|type=PhD dissertation|publisher=University of Southern California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors must be stable to achieve a covariant δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; As such, correlations between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C can be used to infer developments in the lake stability and [[Hydrology|hydrological]] characteristics through time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; It is important to note that this correlation is not directly related to the lake level itself but rather the rate of change in lake level. Three different studies with three different methods provide different resolutions to understanding the lake level history of Mono Lake (read below).

=== 150-year record ===
The [[Covariance|covariation]] between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in lake water and lake level  in Mono Lake have been recorded over a 150-year time interval in Mono Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;/&gt; The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record was compared to historic lake levels recorded by the USGS. The lake level and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record were observed to have a strong correlation with minor offsets. Changes in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of lake water were inversely correlated with lake level. This revealed six stages in lake level in the past 150 years:&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; high stands at 1845, 1880, and 1915 as well as low stands at 1860, 1900, and 1933. The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record compared well to the recorded precipitation and streamflow of Nevada City in California. Decreases in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O correlated well with increases in precipitation as well as increases in streamflow and vice versa.

=== 10,000-year record ===
A [[Core sample|sediment core]] from Mono Lake reveals a 10,000 year record of carbonates ([[Radiometric dating|dated]] through ash beds).&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Here δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C did covary when observed through long time intervals of &gt;5,000 years, whereas the correlation was not present during shorter time scales. It was found that the record revealed 5 periods of distinct lake conditions:&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;

9.7 - 8.7 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Rising lake level.'' Decreasing δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O  and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C reflected an increased lake level. In fact, the lake level reached the Holocene High Stand. This high stand corresponded to a period of maximum effective [[moisture]] in the Great Basin.

8.7 - 6.5 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Dropping lake level.'' A sudden increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O  and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C suggested that lake levels dropped. Following, weak correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C suggested that lake levels stabilized.

6.5 - 5.9 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Rising lake level.'' An increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C correlated with a decrease in lake level. The lake level drop continued until the Holocene Low Stand at 5.9 ka, which corresponded to a period of minimum effective moisture in the Great Basin.

2 - 0.6 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''[[Unconformity]].'' The gap between 6 - 2 ka could be attributed to shallow lake conditions. In addition, sediment types observed in the core between 2 - 0.6 ka largely reflected shallow water conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;Newton, M. S. (1994). Holocene fluctuations of Mono Lake, California: the sedimentary record. SEPM Special Publication, 50, 143-157.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Medieval Warm Period]], which occurred from 0.9 - 0.7 ka, the lake level was around the same as today.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt; In general, the period was dominated by a shallow, stable lake level with low covariance between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

490 – 360 years ago: ''High, fluctuating lake levels.'' This period corresponded to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The isotopic record had very high annual resolution. The lake levels were generally high but fluctuated a little resulting in low correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C . At the end of this period, δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C evolved towards a trend of decreasing lake level.

Overall the lake levels of Mono Lake appeared to have corresponded to known climatic events such as periods of maximum or minimum effective moisture, the Medieval Warm Period&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; and the Little Ice Age.

=== 35,000-year record ===
Lake levels of Mono Lake during the [[Pleistocene]] have also been reconstructed using [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] inspection of paleoshorelines,&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Lajoie|first=K. R.|date=1968|title=Late Quaternary stratigraphy and geologic history of Mono Basin, eastern California|type=PhD dissertation|publisher=University of Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating|radio carbon dating]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;Benson, L. V., Currey, D. R., Dorn, R. I., Lajoie, K. R., Oviatt, C. G., Robinson, S. W., Smith, G. I., &amp; Stine, S. (1990). Chronology of expansion and contraction of four Great Basin lake systems during the past 35,000 years. ''Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology'', ''78''(3-4), 241-286.&lt;/ref&gt; and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from sediments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;/&gt; These analyses helped reconstruct lake levels of the past 35,000 years.

36 - 35 ka: ''Rising lake level.'' Decreasing δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O revealed that lake level began to rise at about this time from a lake level altitude of 2015 m.

35 - 21 ka: ''High stable lake level.'' Little fluctuation in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O suggested a stable lake level. This stable lake level corresponded to two beds of silt that would have been deposited in a deep lake.

20 - 15 ka: ''Dropping lake level.'' There was a sudden fall in lake level at the beginning of this period. Sand delta terraces from this time period indicated a lake-surface altitude of 2035 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;/&gt; Recorded δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O increased over this time period, reflecting falling lake level.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;

5 - 13 ka: ''Rising lake level.'' During this period, Mono Lake rose to its highest lake-surface altitude of 2155 m. This corresponded to a decrease in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.

13+ ka: ''Dropping lake level.'' Following peak lake level, the lake level decreased to 1965 m at ~ 10 ka as evidenced by an increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and paleoshorelines.

This lake-level record has been correlated with significant climatic events including [[polar jet stream]] movement, [[Heinrich event|Heinrich]], and [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] events.

=== Paleoclimate reconstruction ===
{{confusing section|date=May 2019}}&lt;!--Overlaps with and is inconsistent with Lake Level section, above--&gt;
The reconstruction of lake levels through [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon]] and [[D18O|oxygen]] isotopes have revealed interesting results that can be correlated to dramatic [[Climate change|changes in climate]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. In the recent past, Earth experienced periods of increased [[Glacial period|glaciation]] known as [[ice age]]s. This geological period of ice ages is known as the [[Pleistocene]], which lasted until ~11 [[Millennium|ka]]. Lake levels in Mono Lake can reveal how the climate fluctuated. For example, during the cold climate of the Pleistocene the lake level was higher because there was less [[evaporation]] and more [[precipitation]]. Following the Pleistocene, the lake level was generally lower due to increased [[evaporation]] and decreased [[precipitation]] associated with a warmer climate. Mono Lake reveals the climate variation on 3 different time scales: [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] (repeats every 1,000 years), [[Heinrich event|Heinrich]] (varying repetition), and [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovich]] (repeats every 10,000 years).

==== Dansgaard-Oeschger ====
From the compilation of [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] data over the past 51,000 years from lakes throughout the [[Great Basin]], including [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], [[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]], [[Owens Lake]], and Mono Lake, it has been observed that changes in lake level can be correlated to [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger events]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;Benson, L., Lund, S., Negrini, R., Linsley, B., &amp; Zic, M. (2003). Response of north American Great basin lakes to Dansgaard–Oeschger oscillations. ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', ''22''(21-22), 2239-2251.&lt;/ref&gt; The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from these lakes showed oscillations in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of carbonates from these four lakes. Oscillation between high δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and low δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O reflected cold/dry (low lake level with low precipitation) and warm/wet (high lake level with high precipitation) respectively. Read more about these isotopic effects in the Lake Level History section. Furthermore, [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) of the sediments from Pyramid Lake and Owens Lake were inversely correlated with δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and showed the same oscillations. TOC is often an indicator of the degree of biological [[Primary production|productivity]] in a lake. This would suggest that high productivity correlated with a warm/wet climate at Mono Lake, while low productivity correlated with a cold/dry climate at Mono Lake. The timing of these oscillations matched the timing of Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the [[GISP2]] core from 46 - 27 ka.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; Minima in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and maxima in TOC correlated with 11 different Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Dansgaard-Oeschger events are fluctuations in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from [[ice core]]s that repeat every 1,000 years. They are thought to be related to global climatic events. However, the exact causes for these fluctuations are still unresolved.

==== Heinrich events ====
The lake level history of 36,000 years was investigated through correlations between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records, [[radiocarbon dating]], and [[paleomagnetic secular variation]] from Mono Lake sediments as described in the Lake Level History section.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot;&gt;Benson, L. V., Lund, S. P., Burdett, J. W., Kashgarian, M., Rose, T. P., Smoot, J. P., &amp; Schwartz, M. (1998). Correlation of late-Pleistocene lake-level oscillations in Mono Lake, California, with North Atlantic climate events. ''Quaternary Research'', ''49''(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Peaks in the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records of Mono Lake sediments correlated with 3 [[Heinrich event]]s known from the sea [[Core sample|cores]] of the [[North Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; Heinrich events occurred when massive numbers of [[iceberg]]s broke off from the [[ice sheet]]s and fell into the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; These Heinrich events have been observed to correlate with peaks in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of carbonates globally. This pattern would generally indicate a global drop in temperature and a rising ice-volume. As water vapor moves from the [[Hadley cell|equator to the poles]], &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is preferentially precipitated compared to &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O. When the water precipitates at the poles, it has a very depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. Hence, ice sheets are vast reservoirs of &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and have a very depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. If the temperature dropped and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-containing ice-volumes grew, the remaining water bodies would experience a corresponding increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. Three peaks in the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records of Mono Lake may reflect 3 episodes of vast growth of the Pleistocene ice sheets that resulted in massive iceberg break-off at the ice-water interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt;

==== Milankovich-scale events ====
The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from Mono Lake sediments also exhibit trends over longer timescales of ~10,000 years. From 35-18 [[Millennium|ka]], the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition of Mono Lake sediments were gradually decreasing. This decreasing trend was inversely correlated with an increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of sediments from a North Atlantic sea core.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt;  This trend in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O suggested correlation with the southward movement of the [[polar jet stream]] from 35-18 [[Millennium|ka.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; As the polar jet stream moved southward, it caused increased precipitation of isotopically depleted rain water.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot;&gt;Benson, L. V., &amp; Thompson, R. S. (1987). Lake-level variation in the Lahontan Basin for the past 50,000 years. ''Quaternary Research'', ''28''(1), 69-85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot;&gt;Antevs, E. (1948). ''The Great Basin, with Emphasis on Glacial and Postglacial Times: Climatic Changes and Pre-white Man. III''. University of Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this caused Southern water bodies like Mono Lake to become isotopically depleted, while Northern oceans became isotopically enriched.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt;  This movement of the polar jet stream was presumably caused by an increase in the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|Northern American ice sheet.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt; Two δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O minima at 18 ka and 13.1 ka in Mono Lake sediments reflected two lake level high-stands of Mono Lake. These lake level high-stands presumably corresponded to two passages of the polar jet stream over Mono Lake that precipitated large amounts of rainwater with a depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; Following, the polar jet stream was forced south of Mono Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, the sudden reduction in [[Total inorganic carbon|Total Inorganic Carbon]] (TIC) during 26 - 14 ka could be attributed to the [[Last glacial period|Tioga glaciation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:92&quot; /&gt; The Tioga glaciation would have caused a high in-flux of detrital materials to Mono Lake. As a result, the TIC in Mono Lake sediments would be lowered during this time period.

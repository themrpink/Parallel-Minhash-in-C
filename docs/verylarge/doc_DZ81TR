In classical [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]], '''begging the question''' or '''assuming the conclusion''' is an [[informal fallacy]] that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it.

For example, the statement ''&quot;green is the best color, because it is the greenest of all colors&quot;'' claims that the color green is the best because it is the greenest - which it [[Presupposition|presupposes]] is the best.

It is a type of [[circular reasoning]]: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrick248&quot;&gt;Herrick (2000) 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[vernacular]] usage, however, ''begging the question'' is often used to mean &quot;raising the question&quot; or &quot;suggesting the question&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbett&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/begging-the-question-again/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 |title=Begging the Question, Again |first=Philip B. |last=Corbett |date=25 September 2008 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m-w&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/beg-the-question|title=Beg the Question|access-date=3 November 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is confused with &quot;[[question dodging|dodging the question]]&quot;, an attempt to avoid it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liberman&quot;/&gt;

The phrase ''begging the question'' originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}},'' which in turn was a mistranslation of the Greek for &quot;assuming the conclusion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liberman&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
The original phrase used by [[Aristotle]] from which ''begging the question'' descends is: τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς (or sometimes ἐν ἀρχῇ) αἰτεῖν, &quot;asking for the initial thing.&quot; Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of [[dialectic]]al argument he discusses in his ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'', book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.

In this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called &quot;the initial thing&quot; (τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ) and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' and in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' book II, (64b, 34–65a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18–59b, 1).

The stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the ''Topics'' included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of ''asking for the initial thing''—which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, ''[[Prior Analytics|PA]]'' II 16).

The term was translated into English from [[Latin]] in the 16th century. The Latin version, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'', &quot;asking for the starting point&quot;, can be interpreted in different ways. ''{{lang|la|Petitio}}'' (from ''{{lang|la|peto}}''), in the [[Postclassical Era|post-classical]] context in which the phrase arose, means ''assuming'' or ''postulating'', but in the older classical sense means ''petition'', ''request'' or ''beseeching''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liberman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title='Begging the question': we have answers|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290|work=Language Log|accessdate=12 January 2012|authorlink=Mark Liberman|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kretzmann1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Kretzmann |first2=E. |last2=Stump |year=1988 |title=Logic and the Philosophy of Language |series=The Cambridge Translations of Medieval Philosophical Texts |volume=Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521280631 |lccn=87030542 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh-vE6T_WIcC&amp;pg=PA374 |page=374 |quote=One sort of ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is common, and another is dialectical; but common ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is not relevant here. A dialectical ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' is an expression that insists that in the disputation some act must be performed with regard to the statable thing [at issue]. For example, &quot;I require (''{{lang|la|peto}}'') you to respond affirmatively to 'God exists,'&quot; and the like. And ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' obligates [the respondent] to perform an action with regard to the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'', while ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' obligates [him] only to maintain [the ''{{lang|la|obligatum}}'']; and in this way ''{{lang|la|petitio}}'' and ''{{lang|la|positio}}'' differ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|Principii}}'', [[genitive case|genitive]] of ''{{lang|la|principium}}'', means ''beginning'', ''basis'' or ''premise'' (of an argument). Literally ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' means &quot;assuming the premise&quot; or &quot;assuming the original point&quot;.

The Latin phrase comes from the Greek {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ αἰτεῖσθαι}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|tò en archêi aiteîsthai}}'', &quot;asking the original point&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreiber2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=S.G. |last=Schreiber |year=2003 |title=Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0791456590 |lccn=2002030968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AICfsOKXhJIC&amp;pg=PA106 |pages=99, 106, 214 |quote=It hardly needs pointing out that such circular arguments are logically unassailable. The importance of the ''Prior Analytics'' introduction to the fallacy is that it places the error in a thoroughly epistemic context. For Aristotle, some reasoning of the form &quot;p because p&quot; is acceptable, namely, in cases where p is self-justifying. In other cases the same (logical) reasoning commits the error of Begging the Question. Distinguishing self-evident from non-self-evident claims is a notorious crux in the history of philosophy. Aristotle's antidote to the subjectivism that threatens always to debilitate such decisions is his belief in a natural order of epistemic justification and the recognition that it takes special (dialectical) training to make that natural order also known to us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' II xvi 64b28–65a26:

{{quote|Begging or assuming the point at issue consists (to take the expression in its widest sense) [of] failing to demonstrate the required proposition. But there are several other ways in which this may happen; for example, if the argument has not taken syllogistic form at all, he may argue from premises which are less known or equally unknown, or he may establish the antecedent by means of its consequents; for demonstration proceeds from what is more certain and is prior. Now begging the question is none of these. [...] If, however, the relation of B to C is such that they are identical, or that they are clearly convertible, or that one applies to the other, then he is begging the point at issue.... [B]egging the question is proving what is not self-evident by means of itself...either because predicates which are identical belong to the same subject, or because the same predicate belongs to subjects which are identical.|Aristotle|Hugh Tredennick (trans.) ''Prior Analytics''}}

Aristotle's distinction between [[apodictic]] science and other forms of non-demonstrative knowledge rests on an [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]] wherein appropriate [[first principles]] become apparent to the trained dialectician:
{{quote|Aristotle's advice in ''[[Sophistical Refutations|S.E.]]'' 27 for resolving fallacies of Begging the Question is brief. If one realizes that one is being asked to concede the original point, one should refuse to do so, even if the point being asked is a reputable belief. On the other hand, if one fails to realize that one has conceded the point at issue and the questioner uses the concession to produce the apparent refutation, then one should turn the tables on the sophistical opponent by oneself pointing out the fallacy committed. In dialectical exchange it is a worse mistake to be caught asking for the original point than to have inadvertently granted such a request. The answerer in such a position has failed to detect when different utterances mean the same thing. The questioner, if he did not realize he was asking the original point, has committed the same error. But if he has knowingly asked for the original point, then he reveals himself to be ontologically confused: he has mistaken what is non-self-explanatory (known through other things) to be something self-explanatory (known through itself). In pointing this out to the false reasoner, one is not just pointing out a tactical psychological misjudgment by the questioner. It is not simply that the questioner falsely thought that the original point, if placed under the guise of a semantic equivalent, or a logical equivalent, or a covering universal, or divided up into exhaustive parts, would be more persuasive to the answerer. Rather, the questioner falsely thought that a non-self-explanatory fact about the world was an explanatory first principle. For Aristotle, that certain facts are self-explanatory while others are not is not a reflection solely of the cognitive abilities of humans. It is primarily a reflection of the structure of noncognitive reality. In short, a successful resolution of such a fallacy requires a firm grasp of the correct explanatory powers of things. Without a knowledge of which things are self-explanatory and which are not, the reasoner is liable to find a question-begging argument persuasive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreiber2003&quot;/&gt;|Scott Gregory Schreiber|''Aristotle on False Reasoning: Language and the World in the Sophistical Refutations''}}

[[Thomas Fowler (Oxford)|Thomas Fowler]] believed that ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' would be more properly called ''{{lang|la|petitio quæsiti}}'', which is literally &quot;begging the question&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler145&quot;&gt;Fowler, Thomas (1887). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WdtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 ''The Elements of Deductive Logic, Ninth Edition'']  (p. 145). Oxford, England: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
To &quot;beg the question&quot; is (also called ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'') to attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself restates or presupposes the claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welton279&quot;&gt;Welton (1905), 279., &quot;Petitio principii is, therefore, committed when a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted.

When the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a ''[[hysteron proteron]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies572&quot;&gt;Davies (1915), 572.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welton280&quot;&gt;Welton (1905), 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Imaginary Invalid|Le Malade imaginaire]]'', a quack &quot;answers&quot; the question of &quot;Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?&quot; with &quot;Because of its [[Hypnotic|soporific]] power.&quot; In the original: '' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de ''Le Malade imaginaire'' in French Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; (Greek for &quot;later earlier&quot;), a [[rhetoric]]al device, as in the statement:
* &quot;Opium induces sleep because it has a [[wikt:soporific|''soporific'']] quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welton281&quot;&gt;Welton (1905), 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading this sentence, the only thing one can learn is a new word in a more classical style (soporific), for referring to a more common action (induces sleep), but it does not explain why it causes that effect. A sentence attempting to explain why opium induces sleep, or the same, why opium has soporific quality, would be the following one:
* &quot;Opium induces sleep because it contains Morphine-6-glucuronide, which inhibits the brain's receptors for pain, causing a pleasurable sensation that eventually induces sleep.&quot;

A similar example:
* &quot;Everyone wants this new Hero Man action figure because it's the hottest toy this season.&quot;

This form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure and literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is &quot;controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Kahane and Cavender (2005), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...[S]eldom is anyone going to simply place the conclusion word-for-word into the premises ... Rather, an arguer might use phraseology that conceals the fact that the conclusion is masquerading as a premise. The conclusion is rephrased to look different and is then placed in the premises.|Paul Herrick&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrick248&quot;/&gt;}}

For example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welton281&quot; /&gt; One could also &quot;bring forth a proposition expressed in words of [[Saxon]] origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of [[Norman language|Norman]] origin&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt; as here:
* &quot;To allow every man an unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the State, for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty perfectly unlimited of expressing his sentiments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Whately]], ''Elements of Logic'' (1826) quoted in Gibson (1908), 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it ''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}'' (''reasoning in a circle'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies572&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowden&quot;&gt;Bradley Dowden, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#BeggingtheQuestion &quot;Fallacies&quot;] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; or, more commonly, ''circular reasoning''.

Begging the question is not considered a [[formal fallacy]] (an [[argument]] that is defective because it uses an incorrect [[deductive reasoning|deductive step]]). Rather, it is a type of [[informal fallacy]] that is [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Fallacy |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200836/fallacy#ref1102387 |quote=Strictly speaking, ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is not a fallacy of reasoning but an ineptitude in argumentation: thus the argument from p as a premise to p as conclusion is not deductively invalid but lacks any power of conviction, since no one who questioned the conclusion could concede the premise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Plausible argument in everyday conversation |publisher=SUNY Press |author=Walton, Douglas |year=1992 |pages=206–207 |isbn=978-0791411575 |quote=Wellington is in New Zealand. Therefore, Wellington is in New Zealand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Petitio Principii&quot;&gt;The reason ''{{lang|la|petitio principii}}'' is considered a fallacy is not that the [[inference]] is invalid (because any statement is indeed equivalent to itself), but that the argument can be deceptive.  A statement cannot prove itself.  A premiss{{sic}} must have a different source of reason, ground or evidence for its truth  from that of the conclusion: Lander University, [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/circular.html &quot;Petitio Principii&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related fallacies ==
{{main|Circular reasoning|Complex question|Ignoratio elenchi}}
Closely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of [[circular reasoning]] (''{{lang|la|circulus in probando}}''), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Dowden |first=Bradley |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#CircularReasoning |title=Fallacies |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual components of a circular argument can be logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Logic |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=1998 |page=205 |isbn=978-0070466494 |last1=Nolt |first1=John Eric |last2=Rohatyn |first2=Dennis |last3=Varzi |first3=Achille}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begging the question is similar to the ''[[complex question]]'' (also known as ''trick question'' or ''fallacy of many questions''): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, &quot;Which color dress is Mary wearing?&quot; may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing pants instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Meyer |year=1988 |title=Questions and Questioning |series=Foundations of Communication |publisher=W. de Gruyter |isbn=978-3110106800 |lccn=lc88025603 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwo5qXTCJewC&amp;pg=PA198 |pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walton1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=D.N. |last=Walton |year=1989 |title=Informal Logic: A Handbook for Critical Argument |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521379250 |lccn=88030762 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kswimguc5uYC&amp;pg=PA36 |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related fallacy is ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' or ''irrelevant conclusion'': an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law ''ought'' to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Fowler, ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''. Entry for ''{{lang|la|ignoratio elenchi}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
&lt;!-- Please read the discussion on the talk page before editing this section --&gt;
Some contemporary English speakers use ''begs the question'' (or equivalent rephrasings thereof) to mean &quot;raises the question&quot;, &quot;invites the question&quot;, &quot;suggests the question&quot;, etc.&lt;ref name=m-w/&gt;  Such preface is then followed with the question, as in:

* [...] ''personal letter delivery is at an all-time low... Which begs the question: are open letters the only kind the future will know?''&lt;ref name=m-w/&gt;
* ''Hopewell's success begs the question: why aren't more companies doing the same?''.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;&quot;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/beg-the-question beg the question]&quot;. ''Collins Cobuild Advanced English Dictionary'' online, accessed on 2019-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;
* [Universal access to all-female schools is] ''an appeal bound to elicit sympathy, especially from guilty liberals, but it begs the question of whether the daughters of the rich benefit from single-sex education.&lt;ref name=m-w/&gt;
* ''Spending the summer travelling around India is a great idea, but it does beg the question of how we can afford it.''&lt;ref name=camb&gt;&quot;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/beg-the-question beg the question]&quot; ''Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus'' online, accessed on 2019-05-13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivist]] grammarians and people versed in philosophy, logic, and law object to such usage as incorrect or, at best, unclear. This is because, it is claimed, the classical sense of Aristotelian logic is the correct one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garner1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=B.A. |last=Garner |year=1995 |title=Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |series=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195142365 |lccn=95003863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA101 |page=101 |quote=''begging the question'' does not mean &quot;evading the issue&quot; or &quot;inviting the obvious questions,&quot; as some mistakenly believe.

'''Teresa of Ávila''', born '''Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada''', also called '''Saint Teresa of Jesus''' (28 March 1515{{spaced ndash}}4&amp;nbsp;or 15 October 1582){{efn|name=julianGregorian}}, was a Spanish noblewoman who felt called to convent life in the [[Catholic Church]]. A [[Carmelite nun]], prominent [[Spanish mystic]], [[Catholic Reformation|religious reformer]], author, [[theologian]] of the contemplative life and of [[mental prayer]], she earned the rare distinction of being declared a [[Doctor of the Church]], but not until over four centuries after her death.{{efn|As of 2019, there are 36 &quot;Doctors of the Church&quot;, of whom only four are women.}} Active during the [[Catholic Reformation]], she reformed the [[Carmelite Order]]s of both women and men.{{sfn|Lehfeldt|2017|p=217}} The movement she initiated was later joined by the younger Spanish Carmelite friar and mystic [[John of the Cross]]. It led eventually to the establishment of the [[Discalced Carmelites]]. A formal papal decree adopting the split from the old order was issued in 1580.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia.com /&gt;

Teresa, who had been a social celebrity in her home province, was dogged by early family losses and ill health. In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice. She was also at the center of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the [[Protestant reformation]] sweeping over Europe and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] asserting church discipline in her home country. The consequences were to last well beyond her life. One [[papal legate]] described her as a &quot;restless wanderer, disobedient, and stubborn ''femina'' who, under the title of devotion, invented bad doctrines, moving outside the cloister against the rules of the [[Council of Trent]] and her [[prelates]]; teaching as a master against [[Saint Paul]]'s orders that women should not teach.&quot;{{sfn|Hsia|2004|p=240}}

Her written contributions, which include her autobiography, ''The Life of Teresa of Jesus'' and her seminal work ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', are today an integral part of [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. Together with ''The [[Way of Perfection]]'', her works form part of the [[literary canon]] of [[Christian mysticism]] and [[Christian meditation]] practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church.

Other associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence. A ''[[Santo (art)|Santero]]'' image of the [[Immaculate Conception of El Viejo]], said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to [[Peru]], was [[canonically crowned]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 28 December 1989 at the [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception#Nicaragua|Shrine of El Viejo]] in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name=corazones.org /&gt; Another Catholic tradition holds that Saint Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], a statue she may have owned.&lt;{{sfn|Jansen|2018|p=248}} Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals. She continues to be widely noted as an inspiration to philosophers, theologians, historians, neurologists, fiction writers and artists, as well as to countless ordinary people interested in [[Christian spirituality]] and [[mysticism]].

Forty years after her death, in 1622, Teresa was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. At the time she was considered a candidate for [[national patron saint]] of [[Spain]], but this designation was awarded to [[St. James the Apostle]]. She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain.  However, not until 27 September 1970 did [[Pope Paul VI]] proclaim Teresa the first female ''Doctor of the Church'' in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to [[Catholicism]].{{sfn|Pope Paul VI|1970a}}&lt;ref name=catholicnewsagency.com /&gt;

==Early life==
Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada was born in 1515 in [[Ávila, Spain]]. Her paternal grandfather, [[Juan Sánchez de Toledo]], was a [[marrano]] or [[Converso]], a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate. When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] for allegedly returning to the [[Jewish faith]], but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity.{{sfn|Foa|2015}} Her father, [[:es:Alonso Sánchez de Cepeda|Alonso Sánchez de Cepeda]], was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in Ávila. He bought a [[knighthood]] and assimilated successfully into Christian society.

Previously married to [[Catalina del Peso y Henao]], with whom he had three children, in 1509, Sánchez de Cepeda married Teresa's mother, [[Beatriz de Ahumada y Cuevas]], in [[Gotarrendura]].{{sfn|Clissold|1982|p=}}

Teresa's mother brought her up as a dedicated Christian. Fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints, she ran away from home at age seven, with her brother Rodrigo, to seek [[martyrdom]] in the fight against [[the Moors]]. Her uncle brought them home, when he spotted them just outside the town walls.{{sfn|Medwick|1999|loc=Expeditions}}

When Teresa was eleven years old, her mother died, leaving her grief-stricken. This prompted her to embrace a deeper devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] as her spiritual mother. Teresa was also enamored of popular fiction, which at the time consisted primarily of medieval tales of [[knighthood]] and works about fashion, gardens and flowers.{{sfn|Teresa of Avila|Lewis|1870|p=}}&lt;ref name=CNA /&gt; Teresa was sent to the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] nuns' school at [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|1912}}

===Entry into religious life===
After completing her education, she initially resisted the idea of a religious vocation, but after a stay with her uncle and other relatives, she relented. In 1536, aged 20,{{sfn|Pirlo|1997|p=241}} much to the disappointment of her pious and austere father, she decided to enter the local easy-going Carmelite ''Convent of the Incarnation'', significantly built on top of land that had been used previously as a burial ground for Jews. She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially [[Francisco de Osuna|Osuna]]’s ''Third Spiritual Alphabet'' (1527). Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of St. Joseph. She began to experience instances of [[religious ecstasy]].{{sfn|Clissold|1982|p=}}

===Foundations of spirituality===
Her reading of medieval mystics, consisted of directions for examinations of conscience and for spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation known in mystical nomenclature as ''oratio recollectionis'' or ''oratio mentalis''. She also dipped into other mystical [[ascetic]] works such as the ''Tractatus de oratione et meditatione'' of [[Peter of Alcantara]], and perhaps some upon which [[Ignatius of Loyola]] based his ''[[Spiritual Exercises]]''—possibly the ''Spiritual Exercises'' themselves.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

She reported that, during her illness, she had risen from the lowest stage, &quot;recollection&quot;, to the &quot;devotions of silence&quot; or even to the &quot;devotions of ecstasy&quot;, which was one of perfect union with God (see {{slink||Mysticism}}). During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced a rich &quot;blessing of tears&quot;. As the Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] became clear to her, she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of [[original sin]]. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the necessity of absolute subjection to [[God]].{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Around the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of [[St. Augustine]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and found solace in how such a great saint was once a sinner. In her Autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St. Augustine...for he was a sinner too.'{{sfn|Teresa of Avila|Zimmerman|1997|p=}}


Around 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge was diabolical, not divine. She had begun to inflict [[mortification of the flesh|mortifications of the flesh]] upon herself. But her [[confession (sacrament)|confessor]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Borgia]], reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On [[St. Peter's Day]] in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterrupted for more than two years. In another vision, a [[seraph]] drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:

{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...{{efn|name=cherub}} }}

This vision was the inspiration for one of [[Bernini]]'s most famous works, the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' at [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome. Although based in part on Teresa's description of her mystical transverberation in her autobiography, Bernini's depiction of the event is highly eroticized, especially when compared to the entire preceding artistic Teresian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;For the creation of the work and an analysis of its violation of religious decorum, see Franco Mormando's article, ''Did Bernini's 'Ecstasy of St. Teresa' Cross a 17th-century Line of Decorum?''[https://www.academia.edu/44401140/Did_Berninis_Ecstasy_of_St_Teresa_Cross_a_17th_century_Line_of_Decorum]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: &quot;Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.&quot;{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===Embarrassment of raptures===
Teresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures, which sometimes involved [[levitation]]. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians, neurologists and psychiatrists like [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] and Javier Alvarez-Rodriguez, among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th century has been preserved. Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].{{sfn|Barton |1982|pp=}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007|p=}}

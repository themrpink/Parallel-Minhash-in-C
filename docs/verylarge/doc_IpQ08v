The French developers of the [[Micral]] N (1973) filed their patents with the term &quot;Micro-ordinateur&quot;, a literal equivalent of &quot;Microcomputer&quot;, to designate a solid state machine designed with a microprocessor.
In the US the earliest models such as the [[Altair 8800]] were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user, and came with as little as 256 [[byte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]], and no [[input/output]] devices other than indicator lights and switches, useful as a [[proof of concept]] to demonstrate what such a simple device could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: a concise history|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262517676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As microprocessors and [[semiconductor memory]] became less expensive, microcomputers grew cheaper and easier to use.
* Increasingly inexpensive logic chips such as the [[7400 series]] allowed cheap dedicated circuitry for improved [[user interface]]s such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] input, instead of simply a row of switches to toggle bits one at a time.
* Use of [[audio cassette]]s for inexpensive data storage replaced manual re-entry of a program every time the device was powered on.
* Large cheap arrays of silicon [[logic gates]] in the form of [[read-only memory]] and [[EPROM]]s allowed utility programs and self-[[booting]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]s to be stored within microcomputers. These [[stored program]]s could automatically load further more complex software from external storage devices without user intervention, to form an inexpensive [[turnkey system]] that does not require a computer expert to understand or to use the device.
* [[Random access memory]] became cheap enough to afford dedicating approximately 1-2 kilobytes of memory to a [[video display controller]] [[frame buffer]], for a 40x25 or 80x25 text display or blocky color graphics on a common household [[television]]. This replaced the slow, complex, and expensive [[teletypewriter]] that was previously common as an interface to minicomputers and mainframes.
All these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
A large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business  applications. By 1979, many companies such as [[Cromemco]], [[Processor Technology]], [[IMSAI]], [[North Star Computers]], [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products Corporation]], [[Ohio Scientific]], [[Altos Computer Systems]], [[Morrow Designs]] and others produced systems designed for resourceful end users or consulting firms to deliver business systems such as accounting, database management and word processing to small businesses. This allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or [[time-sharing]] service the opportunity to automate business functions, without (usually) hiring a full-time staff to operate the computers. A representative system of this era would have used an [[S100 bus]], an 8-bit processor such as an [[Intel 8080]] or [[Zilog Z80]], and either [[CP/M]] or [[MP/M]] operating system.
The increasing availability and power of [[desktop computer]]s for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers.  As the industry matured, the market for [[personal computer]]s standardized around [[IBM PC compatible]]s running [[DOS]], and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
Modern desktop computers, [[video game console]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s, and many types of [[handheld device]]s, including [[mobile phone]]s, pocket [[calculator]]s, and industrial [[embedded system]]s, may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above.

== Colloquial use of the term ==
[[File:Trinity77.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Three microcomputer systems frequently associated with the first wave of commercially successful 8-bit home computers: The Commodore PET 2001, the Apple II, and the TRS-80 Model 1.]]
By the early 2000s, everyday use of the expression &quot;microcomputer&quot; (and in particular &quot;micro&quot;) declined significantly from its peak in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/117935?redirectedFrom=microcomputer microcomputer]&quot;. OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly associated with the most popular all-in-one [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s (such as the [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[TRS-80]]) and small-business [[CP/M]]-based microcomputers. Because an increasingly diverse range of devices based on modern microprocessors lack the most common characteristic of &quot;microcomputers,&quot; having an [[8-bit]] [[bus (computing)|data bus]], they are not referred to as such in everyday speech.

In colloquial usage, &quot;microcomputer&quot; has been largely supplanted by the term &quot;[[personal computer]]&quot; or &quot;PC&quot;, which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time, a term first coined in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/262572?redirectedFrom=personal+computer personal computer]&quot;. OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; IBM first promoted the term &quot;personal computer&quot; to differentiate the [[IBM PC]] from [[CP/M]]-based microcomputers likewise targeted at the small-business market, and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, following its release, the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] itself was widely imitated, as well as the term.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The component parts were commonly available to producers and the [[BIOS]] was [[reverse engineered]] through [[cleanroom design]] techniques. [[IBM PC compatible]] &quot;clones&quot; became commonplace, and the terms &quot;personal computer&quot;, and especially &quot;PC&quot;, stuck with the general public, often specifically for a computer compatible with DOS (or nowadays Windows).

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Monitors, keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate. Computer memory in the form of [[RAM]], and at least one other less volatile, memory storage device are usually combined with the CPU on a [[system bus]] in one unit. Other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries, a [[power supply]] unit, a keyboard and various input/output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator ([[computer printer|printers]], [[computer display|monitors]], [[human interface device]]s).  Microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time, although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user.  Microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables, so that they are within easy access of users.  Bigger computers like [[minicomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer|mainframes]], and [[supercomputer]]s take up large [[cabinet (computer)|cabinet]]s or even dedicated rooms.

A microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually [[random-access memory|RAM]].  Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform  tasks using RAM alone, some form of [[secondary storage]] is normally desirable. In the early days of home micros, this was often a data [[cassette deck]] (in many cases as an external unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of [[floppy disk]] and [[hard disk]] drives) were built into the microcomputer case.

== History ==

[[Image:Early Personal Computers.jpg|thumb|320px|right|A collection of early microcomputers, including a [[Processor Technology]] SOL-20 (top shelf, right), an MITS [[Altair 8800]] (second shelf, left), a [[TV Typewriter]] (third shelf, center), and an [[Apple I]] in the case at far right.]]

===TTL precursors===
Although they did not contain any microprocessors, but were built around [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL), [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators as far back as 1968 had various levels of programmability comparable to microcomputers. The HP 9100B (1968) had rudimentary conditional (if) statements, statement line numbers, jump statements ([[go to]]), registers that could be used as variables, and primitive subroutines. The programming language resembled [[assembly language]] in many ways. Later models incrementally added more features, including the [[BASIC]] programming language (HP 9830A in 1971). Some models had tape storage and small printers. However, displays were limited to one line at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.org|title=The Museum of HP Calculators}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hewlett Packard 9100A|HP 9100A]] was referred to as a [[personal computer]] in an advertisement in a 1968 [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0021/other/0021ad.pdf |title=Powerful Computing Genie|publisher = Hewlett Packard |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that advertisement was quickly dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/162/3852.pdf |title=Restoring the Balance Between Analysis and Computation |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HP was reluctant to sell them as &quot;computers&quot; because the perception at that time was that a computer had to be big in size to be powerful, and thus decided to market them as calculators.  Additionally, at that time, people were more likely to buy calculators than computers, and, purchasing agents also preferred the term &quot;calculator&quot; because purchasing a &quot;computer&quot; required additional layers of purchasing authority approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0021/0021history.html|title=History of the 9100A desktop calculator, 1968|website=HP virtual museum|access-date=2019-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Datapoint 2200]], made by [[Datapoint|CTC]] in 1970, was also comparable to microcomputers.  While it contains no microprocessor, the [[instruction set]] of its custom TTL processor was the basis of the instruction set for the [[Intel 8008]], and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an 8008.  This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of developing the Datapoint's CPU, but ultimately CTC rejected the 8008 design because it needed 20 support chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |title=MicroprocessorHistory |publisher=Computermuseum.li |date=1971-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205820/http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |archive-date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early system, the [[Kenbak-1]], was released in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used [[Integrated circuit#SSI|small-scale integrated]] [[transistor–transistor logic]] instead of a microprocessor. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, but it was not a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-computer.com/kenbak-1.shtml|title=Kenbak-1|website=The Vintage Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early microcomputers===
In late 1972, a French team headed by [[François Gernelle]] within a small company, Réalisations &amp; Etudes Electroniques (R2E), developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor – the Intel 8008 8-bit microprocessor. This [[Micral|Micral-N]] was marketed in early 1973 as a &quot;Micro-ordinateur&quot; or ''microcomputer'', mainly for scientific and process-control applications. About a hundred [[Micral|Micral-N]] were installed in the next two years, followed by a new version based on the Intel 8080. Meanwhile, another French team developed the Alvan, a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors. The first version was based on LSI chips with an Intel 8008 as peripheral controller (keyboard, monitor and printer), before adopting the [[Zilog Z80]] as main processor.

In late 1972, a Sacramento State University team led by Bill Pentz built the Sac State 8008 computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/stories/bill-pentz-story/index.html |title=Digibarn Stories: Bill Pentz and (Earliest) History of the Microcomputer (August 2008) |publisher=Digibarn.com |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to handle thousands of patients' medical records.  The Sac State 8008 was designed with the Intel 8008. It had a full set of hardware and software components: a disk operating system included in a series of programmable read-only memory chips (PROMs); 8 Kilobytes of RAM; IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL); a hard drive; a color display; a printer output; a 150 bit/s serial interface for connecting to a mainframe; and even the world's first microcomputer front panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terdiman |first=Daniel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10429544-52.html |title=Inside the world's long-lost first microcomputer &amp;#124; Geek Gestalt&amp;nbsp;— CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1973, [[Sord Computer Corporation]] (now [[Toshiba|Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation]]) completed the SMP80/08, which used the [[Intel 8008]] microprocessor. The SMP80/08, however, did not have a commercial release. After the first general-purpose microprocessor, the [[Intel 8080]], was announced in April 1974, Sord announced the SMP80/x, the first microcomputer to use the 8080, in May 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/personal/0086.html |title = SMP80/X series-Computer Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches; one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them (the Datapoint 2200 was a striking exception, bearing a modern design based on a monitor, keyboard, and tape and disk drives).  Of the early &quot;box of switches&quot;-type microcomputers, the MITS [[Altair 8800]] (1975) was arguably the most famous.  Most of these simple, early microcomputers were sold as [[electronic kits]]—bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used.

The period from about 1971 to 1976 is sometimes called the [[:Category:Early microcomputers|first generation]] of microcomputers. Many companies such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kawCnk4051wC&amp;pg=PA154|title=Computer Adventures|last=Hawkins|first = William J.|date = December 1983|magazine = Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[Processor Technology]] [[SOL-20]] was designed, which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system. The [[SOL-20]] had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights. The [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known [[personal computer]] hardware and software companies, such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer]]. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.

===Home computers===
By 1977, the introduction of the second generation, known as [[home computer]]s, made microcomputers considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors' operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics. The ability to connect to a monitor (screen) or TV set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers. The [[BASIC]] language, which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language, became a standard feature. These features were already common in [[minicomputer]]s, with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar.

In 1979, the launch of the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] (initially for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]]) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its [[IBM PC]], the term [[personal computer]] became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the IBM PC architecture ([[PC compatible]]).

'''Bebop''' or '''bop''' is a style of [[jazz]] developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features compositions characterized by a fast tempo, complex [[chord progression]]s with rapid chord changes and numerous [[modulation (music)|changes of key]], instrumental virtuosity, and [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]] based on a combination of [[harmonic structure]], the use of scales and occasional references to the [[melody]].

Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented [[Swing music|swing]] style with a new &quot;musician's music&quot; that was not as danceable and demanded close listening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Double&quot;&gt;Lott, Eric. Double V, Double-Time: Bebop's Politics of Style. Callaloo, No. 36 (Summer, 1988), pp. 597–605&lt;/ref&gt;  As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex [[syncopation]], [[altered chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used [[rhythm section]]s in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the [[swing music|swing]] era was the [[big band]] of up to fourteen pieces playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of [[saxophone]] (alto or tenor), [[trumpet]], [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[double bass]], and [[drum kit|drums]] playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the &quot;head&quot;) with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.

Some of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are: [[alto sax]] player [[Charlie Parker]]; [[tenor sax]] players [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]; [[clarinet]] player [[Buddy DeFranco]]; trumpeters [[Fats Navarro]], [[Clifford Brown]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]; pianists [[Bud Powell]], [[Mary Lou Williams]], and [[Thelonious Monk]]; [[electric guitar]]ist [[Charlie Christian]], [[Joe Pass]] and drummers [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Art Blakey]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:&quot;Bebop-rebop&quot; early bop phrase.png|thumb|right|&quot;In spite of the explanations of the origins of these words, players actually did sing the words &quot;bebop&quot; and &quot;rebop&quot; to an early bop phrase as shown in the following example.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Paul O. W. and Gerow, Maurice (1964). ''A Study of Jazz'', 81. Second edition. {{ISBN|0-697-03557-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|&quot;Bebop-rebop&quot; early bop phrase.mid|Play}}]]

The term &quot;bebop&quot; is derived from nonsense syllables (vocables) used in [[scat singing]]; the first known example of &quot;bebop&quot; being used was in [[McKinney's Cotton Pickers]]' &quot;Four or Five Times&quot;, recorded in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ety&quot;&gt;Gleason, Ralph J. (15 February 1959) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19590215&amp;id=5LxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_AAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,874814 &quot;Jazz Fan Really Digs the Language – All the Way Back to Its Origin&quot;]. ''Toledo Blade''.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears again in a 1936 recording of &quot;I'se a Muggin'&quot; by [[Jack Teagarden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ety&quot; /&gt; A variation, &quot;rebop&quot;, appears in several 1939 recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ety&quot; /&gt; The first, known print appearance also occurred in 1939, but the term was little-used subsequently until applied to the music now associated with it in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ety&quot; /&gt; [[Thelonious Monk]] claims that the original title &quot;Bip Bop&quot; for his composition &quot;[[52nd Street Theme]]&quot;, was the origin of the name bebop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin]]|title=Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2009|page = 95|ISBN = 1439190496}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some researchers speculate that it was a term used by [[Charlie Christian]] because it sounded like something he hummed along with his playing.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dawson and Steve Propes, ''What Was The First Rock'n'Roll Record?'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-571-12939-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dizzy Gillespie]] stated that the audiences coined the name after hearing him scat the then-nameless compositions to his players and the press ultimately picked it up, using it as an official term: &quot;People, when they'd wanna ask for those numbers and didn't know the name, would ask for bebop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/creatingblackame00pain|url-access=registration|title=Creating Black Americans|author=Nell Irvin Painter|author-link=Nell Irvin Painter|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2006|pages=[https://archive.org/details/creatingblackame00pain/page/228 228]–229|ISBN=0-19-513755-8|accessdate=Jul 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that it derives from the cry of &quot;Arriba! Arriba!&quot; used by Latin American bandleaders of the period to encourage their bands.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gammond, ''The Oxford Companion to Popular Music'', 1991, {{ISBN|0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, the terms &quot;bebop&quot; and &quot;rebop&quot; were used interchangeably. By 1945, the use of &quot;bebop&quot;/&quot;rebop&quot; as nonsense syllables was widespread in [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] music, for instance [[Lionel Hampton]]'s &quot;[[Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The bebop musician or '''bopper''' became a [[stock character]] in jokes of the 1950s, overlapping with the [[beatnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=William Bruce |title=Informal Sociology |date=1963 |publisher=Random House |page=93 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Swing era influences===
[[File:Dizzy Gillespie at the Downbeat Club, ca 1947.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Dizzy Gillespie, at the Downbeat Club, NYC, ca 1947]]

Bebop grew out of the culmination of trends that had been occurring within [[swing music]] since the mid-1930s: less explicit timekeeping by the drummer, with the primary rhythmic pulse moving from the bass drum to the ride cymbal; a changing role for the piano away from rhythmic density towards accents and fills; less ornate horn section arrangements, trending towards riffs and more support for the underlying rhythm; more emphasis on freedom for soloists; and increasing harmonic sophistication in arrangements used by some bands.  The path towards rhythmically streamlined, solo-oriented swing was blazed by the [[territory bands]] of the southwest with [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] as their musical capital; their music was based on blues and other simple chord changes, riff-based in its approach to melodic lines and solo accompaniment, and expressing an approach adding melody and harmony to swing rather than the other way around.  Ability to play sustained, high energy, and creative solos was highly valued for this newer style and the basis of intense competition.  Swing-era jam sessions and &quot;cutting contests&quot; in Kansas City became legendary.  The [[Kansas City jazz|Kansas City approach to swing]] was epitomized by the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], which came to national prominence in 1937.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
{{quote box|width=23em|&quot;Bebop wasn't developed in any deliberate way.&quot;|—[[Thelonious Monk]]}}

One young admirer of the Basie orchestra in Kansas City was a teenage alto saxophone player named [[Charlie Parker]]. He was especially enthralled by their tenor saxophone player [[Lester Young]], who played long flowing melodic lines that wove in and out of the chordal structure of the composition but somehow always made musical sense.  Young was equally daring with his rhythm and phrasing as with his approach to harmonic structures in his solos.  He would frequently repeat simple two or three note figures, with shifting rhythmic accents expressed by volume, articulation, or tone.  His phrasing was far removed from the two or four bar phrases that horn players had used until then. They would often be extended to an odd number of measures, overlapping the musical stanzas suggested by the harmonic structure. He would take a breath in the middle of a phrase, using the pause, or &quot;free space,&quot; as a creative device. The overall effect was that his solos were something floating above the rest of the music, rather than something springing from it at intervals suggested by the ensemble sound. When the Basie orchestra burst onto the national scene with its 1937 recordings and widely broadcast New York engagements, it gained a national following, with legions of saxophone players striving to imitate Young, drummers striving to imitate [[Jo Jones]], piano players striving to imitate Basie, and trumpet players striving to imitate [[Buck Clayton]]. Parker played along with the new Basie recordings on a [[Victrola]] until he could play Young's solos note for note.&lt;ref&gt;Bird Lives!The High Life And Hard Times of Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, by Ross Russell, p. 89-92, Da Capo Press, 1996, 404 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s the [[Duke Ellington Orchestra]] and the [[Jimmie Lunceford|Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra]] were exposing the music world to harmonically sophisticated musical arrangements by [[Billy Strayhorn]] and [[Sy Oliver]], respectively, which implied chords as much as they spelled them out. That understatement of harmonically sophisticated chords would soon be used by young musicians exploring the new musical language of bebop.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The brilliant technique and harmonic sophistication of pianist [[Art Tatum]] inspired young musicians including Charlie Parker and [[Bud Powell]].  In his early days in New York, Parker held a job washing dishes at an establishment where Tatum had a regular gig.&lt;ref&gt;Bird Lives!The High Life And Hard Times of Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, by Ross Russell, p. 100-102, Da Capo Press, 1996, 404 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the divergent trends of the swing era was a resurgence of small ensembles playing &quot;head&quot; arrangements, following the approach used with Basie's big band.  The small band format lent itself to more impromptu experimentation and more extended solos than did the bigger, more highly arranged bands.  The 1939 recording of &quot;[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]&quot; by [[Coleman Hawkins]] with a small band featured an extended saxophone solo with minimal reference to the theme that was unique in recorded jazz, and which would become characteristic of bebop. That solo showed a sophisticated harmonic exploration of the composition, with implied passing chords. Hawkins would eventually go on to lead the first formal recording of the bebop style in early 1944.&lt;ref&gt;see Early bebop recordings&lt;/ref&gt;

===Going beyond swing in New York===
As the 1930s turned to the 1940s, Parker went to New York as a featured player in the [[Jay McShann|Jay McShann Orchestra]]. In New York he found other musicians who were exploring the harmonic and melodic limits of their music, including [[Dizzy Gillespie]], a [[Roy Eldridge]]-influenced trumpet player who, like Parker, was exploring ideas based on upper chord intervals, beyond the [[Seventh (chord)|seventh]] chords that had traditionally defined jazz harmony. While Gillespie was with [[Cab Calloway]], he practiced with bassist [[Milt Hinton]] and developed some of the key harmonic and chordal innovations that would be the cornerstones of the new music; Parker did the same with bassist [[Gene Ramey]] while with McShann's group. Guitarist [[Charlie Christian]], who had arrived in New York in 1939 was, like Parker, an innovator extending a southwestern style. Christian's major influence was in the realm of rhythmic [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. Christian commonly emphasized weak beats and off beats and often ended his phrases on the second half of the fourth beat. Christian experimented with asymmetrical phrasing, which was to become a core element of the new bop style.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Bud Powell was pushing forward with a rhythmically streamlined, harmonically sophisticated, virtuosic piano style and [[Thelonious Monk]] was adapting the new harmonic ideas to his style that was rooted in Harlem [[stride piano]] playing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Drummers such as [[Kenny Clarke]] and [[Max Roach]] were extending the path set by Jo Jones, adding the ride cymbal to the high hat cymbal as a primary timekeeper and reserving the bass drum for accents.  Bass drum accents were colloquially termed &quot;bombs,&quot; which referenced events in the world outside of New York as the new music was being developed. The new style of drumming supported and responded to soloists with accents and fills, almost like a shifting [[call and response (music)|call and response]].  This change increased the importance of the string bass. Now, the bass not only maintained the music's harmonic foundation, but also became responsible for establishing a metronomic rhythmic foundation by playing a &quot;walking&quot; bass line of four quarter notes to the bar. While small swing ensembles commonly functioned without a bassist, the new bop style required a bass in every small ensemble.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The kindred spirits developing the new music gravitated to sessions at [[Minton's Playhouse]], where Monk and Clarke were in the house band, and [[Monroe's Uptown House]], where Max Roach was in the house band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis89Auto&quot;&gt;[[Miles Davis]] (1989) ''Autobiography'', chapter 3, pp. 43–5, 57–8, 61–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the atmosphere created at jams like the ones found at Minton's Playhouse was an air of exclusivity: the &quot;regular&quot; musicians would often reharmonize the standards, add complex rhythmic and phrasing devices into their melodies, or &quot;heads,&quot; and play them at breakneck tempos in order to exclude those whom they considered outsiders or simply weaker players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Double&quot; /&gt; These pioneers of the new music (which would later be termed ''bebop'' or ''bop'', although Parker himself never used the term, feeling it demeaned the music) began exploring advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords and chord substitutions. The bop musicians advanced these techniques with a more freewheeling, intricate and often arcane approach. Bop improvisers built upon the phrasing ideas first brought to attention by Lester Young's soloing style. They would often deploy phrases over an odd number of bars and overlap their phrases across bar lines and across major harmonic cadences. Christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating a harmony in their improvised line before it appeared in the song form being outlined by the rhythm section. This momentary dissonance creates a strong sense of forward motion in the improvisation.  The sessions also attracted top musicians in the swing idiom such as [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Lester Young]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Roy Eldridge]], and [[Don Byas]].  Byas became the first tenor saxophone player to fully assimilate the new bebop style in his playing.  In 1944 the crew of innovators was joined by [[Dexter Gordon]], a tenor saxophone player from the west coast in New York with the [[Louis Armstrong]] band, and a young trumpet player attending the [[Juilliard School of Music]], [[Miles Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis89Auto&quot; /&gt;

===Early recordings===
Bebop originated as &quot;musicians' music&quot;, played by musicians with other money-making gigs who did not care about the commercial potential of the new music. It did not attract the attention of major record labels nor was it intended to. Some of the early bebop was recorded informally. Some sessions at Minton's in 1941 were recorded, with Thelonious Monk alongside an assortment of musicians including [[Joe Guy (musician)|Joe Guy]], [[Hot Lips Page]], Roy Eldridge, Don Byas, and Charlie Christian.&lt;ref name=monkdisco&gt;{{cite web|title= Thelonious Monk Discography|url=https://www.jazzdisco.org/thelonious-monk/discography}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian is featured in recordings from May 12, 1941 (Esoteric ES 548). Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were both participants at a recorded jam session hosted by [[Billy Eckstine]] on February 15, 1943, and Parker at another Eckstine jam session on February 28, 1943 (Stash ST-260; ST-CD-535).&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerdisco&quot; /&gt;

Formal recording of bebop was first performed for small specialty labels, who were less concerned with mass-market appeal than the major labels, in 1944.  On February 16, 1944, Coleman Hawkins led a session including Dizzy Gillespie and Don Byas, with a rhythm section consisting of [[Clyde Hart (pianist)|Clyde Hart]] (piano), [[Oscar Pettiford]] (bass) and Max Roach (drums) that recorded &quot;[[Woody 'n' You|Woody'n You]]&quot; ([[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo]] 751), the first formal recording of bebop.&lt;ref name=gillespiedisdco&gt;{{cite web|title=Dizzy Gillespie Discography|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/dizzy-gillespie/discography/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Parker and Clyde Hart were recorded in a quintet led by guitarist [[Tiny Grimes]] for the [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] label on September 15, 1944 (''Tiny's Tempo, I'll Always Love You Just the Same, Romance Without Finance, Red Cross'').&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerdisco&quot; /&gt;  Hawkins led another bebop-influenced recording session on October 19, 1944, this time with Thelonious Monk on piano, Edward Robinson on bass, and [[Denzil Best]] on drums (''On the Bean, Recollections, Flyin' Hawk, Driftin' on a Reed''; reissue, [[Prestige Records discography|Prestige]] PRCD-24124-2).&lt;ref name=&quot;monkdisco&quot; /&gt;

Parker, Gillespie, and others working the bebop idiom joined the [[The Earl Hines Orchestra|Earl Hines Orchestra]] in 1943, then followed vocalist Billy Eckstine out of the band into the [[Billy Eckstine|Billy Eckstine Orchestra]] in 1944.  The Eckstine band was recorded on [[V-discs]], which were broadcast over the Armed Forces Radio Network and gained popularity for the band showcasing the new bebop style.  The format of the Eckstine band, featuring vocalists and entertaining banter, would later be emulated by Gillespie and others leading bebop-oriented big bands in a style that might be termed &quot;popular bebop&quot;.  Starting with the Eckstine band's session for the [[De Luxe Records|De Luxe]] label on December 5, 1944 (''If That's the Way You Feel, I Want to Talk About You, Blowing the Blues Away, Opus X, I'll Wait and Pray, The Real Thing Happened to Me''), bebop recording sessions grew more frequent. Parker had left the band by that date, but it still included Gillespie along with Dexter Gordon and [[Gene Ammons]] on tenor, [[Leo Parker]] on baritone, [[Tommy Potter]] on bass, [[Art Blakey]] on drums, and [[Sarah Vaughan]] on vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;gordondisco&quot; /&gt; ''Blowing the Blues Away'' featured a tenor saxophone duel between Gordon and Ammons.

On January 4, 1945, Clyde Hart led a session including Parker, Gillespie, and Don Byas recorded for the [[Continental Records|Continental]] label (''What's the Matter Now, I Want Every Bit of It, That's the Blues, G.I. Blues, Dream of You, Seventh Avenue,  Sorta Kinda, Ooh Ooh, My My, Ooh Ooh'').&lt;ref name=parkerdisco&gt;{{cite web|title= Charlie Parker Discography|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/charlie-parker/discography/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gillespie recorded his first session as a leader on January 9, 1945, for the [[Manor Records|Manor]] label, with Don Byas on tenor, [[Trummy Young]] on trombone, Clyde Hart on Piano, Oscar Pettiford on bass, and [[Irv Kluger]] on drums.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespiedisdco&quot; /&gt;  The session recorded ''I Can't Get Started, Good Bait, Be-bop (Dizzy's Fingers)'', and ''Salt Peanuts'' (which Manor wrongly named &quot;Salted Peanuts&quot;).  Thereafter, Gillespie would record bebop prolifically and gain recognition as one of its leading figures.  Gillespie featured Gordon as a sideman in a session recorded on February 9, 1945 for the Guild label (''Groovin' High, Blue 'n' Boogie'').  Parker appeared in Gillespie-led sessions dated February 28 (''Groovin' High, All the Things You Are, Dizzy Atmosphere'') and May 11, 1945 (''Salt Peanuts, Shaw 'Nuff, Lover Man, Hothouse'') for the Guild label. Parker and Gillespie were sidemen with Sarah Vaughan on May 25, 1945, for the Continental label (''What More Can a Woman Do, I'd Rather Have a Memory Than a Dream, Mean to Me''). Parker and Gillespie appeared in a session under vibraphonist Red Norvo dated June 6, 1945, later released under the [[Dial Records (1946)|Dial]] label (''Hallelujah, Get Happy, Slam Slam Blues, Congo Blues'').&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespiedisdco&quot; /&gt;  [[Charles Thompson (jazz)|Sir Charles Thompson's]] all-star session of September 4, 1945 for the Apollo label (''Takin' Off, If I Had You, Twentieth Century Blues, The Street Beat'') featured Parker and Gordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;gordondisco&quot; /&gt;  Gordon led his first session for the Savoy label on October 30, 1945, with [[Sadik Hakim]] (Argonne Thornton) on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and [[Eddie Nicholson]] on drums (''Blow Mr Dexter, Dexter's Deck, Dexter's Cuttin' Out, Dexter's Minor Mad'').&lt;ref name = gordondisco&gt;{{cite web|title=Dexter Gordon Discography|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/dexter-gordon/discography/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parker's first session as a leader was on November 26, 1945, for the Savoy label, with Miles Davis and Gillespie on trumpet, Hakim/Thornton and Gillespie on piano, [[Curley Russell]] on bass and Max Roach on drums (''Warming Up a Riff, Now's the Time, Billie's Bounce, Thriving on a Riff, Ko-Ko, Meandering''). After appearing as a sideman in the R&amp;B-oriented [[Cootie Williams]] Orchestra through 1944, Bud Powell was in bebop sessions led by Frankie Socolow on May 2, 1945 for the Duke label (''The Man I Love, Reverse the Charges, Blue Fantasy, September in the Rain''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jazzdisco.org/bud-powell/discography/|title=Bud Powell Discography|first=Jazz Discography|last=Project|website=www.jazzdisco.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dexter Gordon on January 29, 1946 for the Savoy label (''Long Tall Dexter, Dexter Rides Again, I Can't  Escape From You, Dexter Digs In'').&lt;ref name=&quot;gordondisco&quot; /&gt;  The growth of bebop through 1945 is also documented in informal live recordings.

===Breakout===
By 1946 bebop was established as a broad-based movement among New York jazz musicians, including trumpeters [[Fats Navarro]] and [[Kenny Dorham]], trombonists [[J. J. Johnson]] and [[Kai Winding]], alto saxophonist [[Sonny Stitt]], tenor saxophonist [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]], baritone saxophonists [[Leo Parker]] and [[Serge Chaloff]], vibraphonist [[Milt Jackson]], pianists [[Erroll Garner]] and [[Al Haig]], bassist [[Slam Stewart]], and others who would contribute to what would become known as &quot;modern jazz&quot;.  The new music was gaining radio exposure with broadcasts such as those hosted by [[Symphony Sid|&quot;Symphony Sid&quot; Torin]].  Bebop was taking root in Los Angeles as well, among such modernists as trumpeters [[Howard McGhee]] and [[Art Farmer]], alto players [[Sonny Criss]] and [[Frank Morgan (musician)|Frank Morgan]], tenor players [[Teddy Edwards]] and [[Lucky Thompson]], trombonist [[Melba Liston]], pianists [[Dodo Marmarosa]], Jimmy Bunn and [[Hampton Hawes]], guitarist [[Barney Kessel]], bassists [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Red Callender]], and drummers [[Roy Porter (drummer)|Roy Porter]] and [[Connie Kay]].  Gillespie's &quot;Rebop Six&quot; (with Parker on alto, Lucky Thompson on tenor, Al Haig on piano, Milt Jackson on vibes, [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]] on bass, and [[Stan Levey]] on drums) started an engagement in Los Angeles in December 1945.   Parker and Thompson remained in Los Angeles after the rest of the band left, performing and recording together for six months before Parker suffered an addiction-related breakdown in July.  Parker was again active in Los Angeles in early 1947.  Parker and Thompson's tenures in Los Angeles, the arrival of Dexter Gordon and [[Wardell Gray]] later in 1946, and the promotional efforts of [[Ross Russell (jazz)|Ross Russell]], [[Norman Granz]], and [[Gene Norman]] helped solidify the city's status as a center of the new music.

Gillespie landed the first recording date with a major label for the new music, with the [[RCA Bluebird]] label recording Dizzy Gillespie And his Orchestra on February 22, 1946 (''52nd Street Theme, A Night in Tunisia, Ol' Man Rebop, Anthropology'').&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespiedisdco&quot; /&gt; Later Afro-Cuban styled recordings for Bluebird in collaboration with Cuban ''rumberos'' [[Chano Pozo]] and [[Sabu Martinez]], and arrangers [[Gil Fuller]] and [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]] (''Manteca, Cubana Be, Cubana Bop, Guarache Guaro'') would be among his most popular, giving rise to the Latin dance music craze of the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Gillespie, with his extroverted personality and humor, glasses, lip beard and beret, would become the most visible symbol of the new music and new jazz culture in popular consciousness.  That of course slighted the contributions of others with whom he had developed the music over the preceding years.  His show style, influenced by [[Black Vaudeville|black vaudeville circuit]] entertainers, seemed like a throwback to some and offended some purists (&quot;too much grinning&quot; according to Miles Davis), but it was laced with a subversive sense of humor that gave a glimpse of attitudes on racial matters that black musicians had previously kept away from the public at large.  Before the Civil Rights Movement, Gillespie was confronting the [[racial segregation|racial divide]] by lampooning it.  The intellectual subculture that surrounded bebop made it something of a sociological movement as well as a musical one.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

With the imminent demise of the big swing bands, bebop had become the dynamic focus of the jazz world, with a broad-based &quot;progressive jazz&quot; movement seeking to emulate and adapt its devices.  It was to be the most influential foundation of jazz for a generation of jazz musicians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Beyond===
By 1950, bebop musicians such as [[Clifford Brown]] and [[Sonny Stitt]] began to smooth out the rhythmic eccentricities of early bebop. Instead of using jagged phrasing to create rhythmic interest, as the early boppers had, these musicians constructed their improvised lines out of long strings of eighth notes and simply accented certain notes in the line to create rhythmic variety.  The early 1950s also saw some smoothing in Charlie Parker's style.

During the early 1950s bebop remained at the top of awareness of jazz, while its harmonic devices were adapted to the new &quot;cool&quot; school of jazz led by Miles Davis and others.  It continued to attract young musicians such as [[Jackie McLean]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[John Coltrane]].  As musicians and composers began to work with expanded music theory during the mid-1950s, its adaptation by musicians who worked it into the basic dynamic approach of bebop would lead to the development of post-bop.  Around that same time, a move towards structural simplification of bebop occurred among musicians such as [[Horace Silver]] and [[Art Blakey]], leading to the movement known as hard bop.  Development of jazz would occur through the interplay of bebop, cool, post-bop, and hard bop styles through the 1950s.

==Musical style==
Bebop differed drastically from the straightforward compositions of the swing era and was instead characterized by fast tempos, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate [[melody|melodies]], and rhythm sections that expanded on their role as tempo-keepers. The music itself seemed jarringly different to the ears of the public, who were used to the bouncy, organized, danceable compositions of Benny Goodman and [[Glenn Miller]] during the swing era. Instead, bebop appeared to sound racing, nervous, erratic and often fragmented. But to jazz musicians and jazz music lovers, bebop was an exciting and beautiful revolution in the art of jazz.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

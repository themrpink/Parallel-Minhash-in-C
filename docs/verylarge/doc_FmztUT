Executives and managers face a constant tension between centralizing and decentralizing information technology for their organizations. They must find the right balance of centralizing which lowers costs and allows more control by upper management, and decentralizing which allows sub-units and users more control. This will depend on analysis of the specific situation. Decentralization is particularly applicable to business or management units which have a high level of independence, complicated products and customers, and technology less relevant to other units.&lt;ref&gt;John Baschab, Jon Piot, ''The Executive's Guide to Information Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YokHUkRBZoAC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=decentralization+information+technology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OtwqUYr3CMzH0AHs94CIBA&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=decentralization%20information%20technology&amp;f=false p. 119] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501182210/https://books.google.com/books?id=YokHUkRBZoAC&amp;pg=PA119 |date=2016-05-01 }}, {{ISBN|9780470135914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Centralization and redecentralization of the Internet ====
[[The New Yorker]] reports that although the Internet was originally decentralized, in recent years it has become less so: &quot;a staggering percentage of communications flow through a small set of corporations – and thus, under the profound influence of those companies and other institutions [...] One solution, espoused by some programmers, is to make the Internet more like it used to be – less centralized and more distributed.&quot;&lt;ref name=newyorkerdecentralize/&gt;

Examples of projects that attempt to contribute to the redecentralization of the Internet include [[ArkOS]], [[Diaspora (social network)|Diaspora]], [[FreedomBox]], [[IndieWeb]], [[Namecoin]], SAFE Network, twtxt and [[ZeroNet]] as well as advocacy group Redecentralize.org, which provides support for projects that aim to make the Web less centralized.&lt;ref name=newyorkerdecentralize /&gt;

In an interview with [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] one of the co-founders of Redecentralize.org explained that:
{{quote|&quot;As we've gone on there's been more and more internet traffic focused through particular nodes such as Google or Facebook. [...] Centralised services that hold all the user data and host it themselves have become increasingly popular because that business model has worked. As the Internet has become more mass market, people are not necessarily willing or knowledgable to host it themselves, so where that hosting is outsourced it's become the default, which allows a centralization of power and a centralization of data that I think is worrying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last= [[Irina Bolychevsky|Bolychevsky]]|first= Irina|url= http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/fivelive/pods/pods_20131112-0401a.mp3|interviewer= [[Jamillah Knowles]]|title= BBC Radio Five Live|date= 12 November 2013|work= Outriders|access-date= 12 December 2013|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131215060028/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/fivelive/pods/pods_20131112-0401a.mp3|archive-date= 15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Appropriate technology ===
&quot;Appropriate technology&quot;, originally described as &quot;intermediate technology&quot; by economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in  ''[[Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered]]'', is generally recognized as encompassing technologies that are small-scale, decentralized, [[labor-intensive]], energy-efficient, [[environmentally sound]], and locally controlled.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-12-335190-6|pages=3, 270|last1=Hazeltine|first1=B.|last2=Bull|first2=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly discussed as an alternative to transfers of capital-intensive technology from [[industrialized nations]] to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development|url=https://archive.org/details/economicdevelopm8thtoda|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-273-65549-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/economicdevelopm8thtoda/page/252 252–54]|last1=Todaro|first1=M.|last2=Smith|first2=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even developed countries developed appropriate technologies, as did the United States in 1977 when it created the [[National Center for Appropriate Technology]] (NCAT), though funding later dropped off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncat.org/regional_offices.php National Center for Appropriate Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310074806/http://www.ncat.org/regional_offices.php |date=2013-03-10 }} website.&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is &quot;design for the other 90 percent&quot; – low-cost solutions for the great majority of the world's low income people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper–Hewitt Museum|title=Design for the other 90%|url=http://designother90.org/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302183226/http://designother90.org/|archive-date=2 March 2013|access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blockchain technology ===
[[Blockchain]] based networks are designed to support decentralization by way of a [[cryptographic]] distributed [[triple-entry accounting]] ledger, typically with &quot;layers&quot; where each layer is defined by an interoperable open protocol on top of which network participants can transact and build products or services without requiring permission from central authorities.

[[Bitcoin]] is the original implementation of a [[blockchain]] where [[proof-of-work]] is used as a means of establishing decentralized consensus (aka. Nakamoto consensus), thus enabling the uniqueness of its intrinsic digital asset and utility as a scarce [[cryptocurrency]]. Since a [[blockchain]] is otherwise an arbitrary data structure with no inherent decentralized properties, at present there are limited use cases, although there is active experimentation in many industries and with different methods of achieving consensus.

Decentralized protocols, applications, and ledgers could be more difficult for governments to control, censor, or regulate as has been seen with [[BitTorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=740102120112124029000093003085085098016073055036039026094121099075069095031124021111057021116004010037021065026018008080103025041086005060042091103116002000123071089062011064009080031099071015124126098089086080124102067007028024071026095021074066069009&amp;EXT=pdf DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND THE RISE OF LEX CRYPTOGRAPHIA], [[SSRN]], ''accessed March 21, 2017.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=7 March 2017|title=Bitcoin: Order without Law in the Digital Age|ssrn=2929133|last1=McGinnis|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Factors hindering decentralization include weak local administrative or technical capacity, which may result in inefficient or ineffective services; inadequate financial resources available to perform new local responsibilities, especially in the start-up phase when they are most needed; or inequitable distribution of resources. Decentralization can make national policy coordination too complex; it may allow local elites to capture functions; local cooperation may be undermined by any distrust between private and public sectors; decentralization may result in higher enforcement costs and conflict for resources if there is no higher level of authority.&lt;ref name=FAOCH2&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4256e/y4256e05.htm Chapter 2. Decentralization and environmental issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102152943/http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4256e/y4256e05.htm |date=2013-01-02 }}, &quot;Environment in decentralized development&quot;, United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (&quot;FAO&quot;), ''accessed February 23, 2013''; also see [http://www.fao.org/docs/up/easypol/346/en_decen_dec_making_016en.pdf Environment in Decentralized Decision Making, An Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529044604/http://www.fao.org/docs/up/easypol/346/en_decen_dec_making_016en.pdf |date=2013-05-29 }}, Agricultural Policy Support Service, Policy Assistance Division, FAO, Rome, Italy, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, decentralization may not be as efficient for standardized, routine, network-based services, as opposed to those that need more complicated inputs. If there is a loss of [[economies of scale]] in procurement of labor or resources, the expense of decentralization can rise, even as central governments lose control over financial resources.&lt;ref name=Forms/&gt;

Other challenges, and even dangers, include the possibility that corrupt local elites can capture regional or local power centers, while constituents lose representation; patronage politics will become rampant and civil servants feel compromised; further necessary decentralization can be stymied; incomplete information and hidden decision-making can occur up and down the hierarchies; centralized power centers can find reasons to frustrate decentralization and bring power back to themselves.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

It has been noted that while decentralization may increase &quot;productive efficiency&quot; it may undermine &quot;allocative efficiency&quot; by making redistribution of wealth more difficult. Decentralization will cause greater disparities between rich and poor regions, especially during times of crisis when the national government may not be able to help regions needing it.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of Remy Prud’homme, &quot;[http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/summary.asp?id=prudhomme1995 The Dangers of Decentralization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616074803/http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/summary.asp?id=prudhomme1995 |date=2012-06-16 }}&quot;, [[World Bank]] Research Observer, 10(2):201, 1995, linked from [http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/viewpage_r.asp?ID=Decentralization Decentralization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026031204/http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/viewpage_r.asp?ID=Decentralization |date=2012-10-26 }}, article &quot;Restructuring local government project&quot; of Dr. Mildred Warner.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Summer &amp;ndash; [[Siege of Chandax]]: A [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] fleet with an expeditionary force (comprising about 50,000 men) under [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] lands on [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]].

Emir [[Sayf al-Dawla]] barely manages to escape, and returns to [[Aleppo]] with only 300 horsemen. The Hamdanids can no longer afford to raid in [[Anatolia]], which is a turning point in the [[Arab-Byzantine wars]] in the East.

==== Europe ====
* [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], a duke of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]], becomes prince (''[[de facto]]'' ruler) of [[Greater Poland|Poland]] on the death of his father [[Siemomysł]]. Mieszko continues to unite the neighbouring tribes under his control. Two obstacles to this plan are the [[West Slavs|Western Slav]] tribal group, the [[Veleti]] (also known as the '''Wilzi''' or &quot;Wolf people&quot;) who are raiding Mieszko's lands for plunder; and the [[Saxony|Saxon]] border dukes, who are pushing eastwards in search of new lands to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brzezinski (1998). History of Poland: ''Old Poland, King Mieszko I'', p. 14. {{ISBN|83-7212-019-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Lombardy|Lombard]] forces closing in on [[Rome]], a papal delegation is sent to King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] ('''the Great''') to appeal for assistance.
* Autumn &amp;ndash; [[Oberto I]], margrave of the [[Obertenghi]] family, takes refuge in [[Germany]]. He travels with influential Italian leaders to the Saxon court of Otto I to intervene in [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] to protect him from Berengar II.
* [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard I]] ('''the Fearless'''), duke of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], marries [[Emma of Paris, Duchess of Normandy|Emma of Paris]]. She is the daughter of [[Hugh the Great]], former [[Duke of the Franks]]. The union gives him a permanent status to the [[House of Capet]].

==== England ====
* [[Dunstan]] receives the [[pallium]] as archbishop of [[Diocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]] from Pope John XII. He reforms monasteries and enforces the rule of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Saint Benedict]]: poverty, [[Evangelical counsels|chastity and obedience]] for monks.

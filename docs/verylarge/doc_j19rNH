English scholar Anne Lancashire describes ''Attack of the Clones'' as &quot;thoroughly political in its narrative&quot;, to the point that interpersonal relations are made subordinate to the political drama that unfolds, and &quot;a critique of the increasing role played by economic and political appetite in contemporary [[First World]] international politics in general&quot;. In this political drama, the Trade Federation, the former idealist Dooku, and Palpatine &quot;[represent] the economic and political greed and ambition ... of the political and business classes&quot;, while the intuition of the Jedi has been clouded by the dark side of the Force. The cityscape of Coruscant, the location of the [[Jedi Temple]], is a [[dystopia]]n environment that refers to 1982's ''[[Blade Runner]]''.{{r|Politics}} Nevertheless, the Jedi endure as the heroes; Obi-Wan's role has been noted as similar to that of [[James Bond]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Young |first=Bryan |title=The Curious Connections Between 'Star Wars' and the James Bond Series |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-james-bond-connections/ |website=/Film |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |date=August 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512233918/https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-james-bond-connections/ |archive-date=May 12, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zam Wesell's attempt on Padmé's life is similar to a scene in the first 007 film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Philip |title=Film of the week: them clones, them clones... |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/may/12/features.review37 |website=the Guardian |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |date=May 12, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025111548/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/may/12/features.review37 |archive-date=October 25, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] films often refer to the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original trilogy]] in order to help connect the films together. Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode1&quot;&gt;''&quot;The Beginning&quot; Making Episode I'' ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' DVD documentary, [2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Such examples include the line &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot;, a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. As with ''Attack of the Clones'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'' was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is the object of the most references in ''Attack of the Clones''. In both films, an [[asteroid]] field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; [[Han Solo]] uses a similar tactic by attaching the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' to a [[Star Destroyer]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. As a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], [[John Knoll]] confirms on the film's DVD commentary that Boba Fett, who would later catch Solo in the act in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', &quot;learned his lesson&quot; from the events of ''Attack of the Clones''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDcom&quot;&gt;''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, Ben Burtt, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was also later released in [[IMAX]] theaters; the film had not been filmed for IMAX but was &quot;up converted&quot; with the [[Remaster|digital remastering]] process. Because of the technical limitations of the IMAX projector at the time, an edited, 120-minute version of the film was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/feature/20021011/indexp2.html |title=Star Wars: Episode II &amp;#124; Making it BIG: Episode II&amp;nbsp;— The IMAX Experience |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023103030/http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/feature/20021011/indexp2.html |archivedate=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the film's release, there was a string of controversies regarding [[copyright infringement]]. In 2000, an underground organization calling itself the Atlas Group, based in [[Perth, Western Australia]] offered a copy of the screenplay, with an asking price of US$100,000, to various fan sites and media organizations, including [[TheForce.Net]]. The scheme was subsequently reported to [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]] by the fan site.

An unauthorized copy was allegedly made at a private showing, using a digital recorder that was pointed at the screen. This copy spread over the internet, and analysts predicted up to a million fans would have seen the film before the day of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Singer, Michael |date=March 10, 2002 |title=Star Wars 'Clones' Showing Up On Web |publisher=InterNetNews |url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1120771 |accessdate=June 21, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523165651/http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1120771| archive-date=May 23, 2011| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, authorities seized thousands of bootlegs throughout [[Kuala Lumpur]] before the film opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=May 15, 2002 |title=Malaysian Clones Attack Star Wars |work=The Financial Express |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Malaysian-Clones-Attack-Star-Wars/46489/ |accessdate=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--- if ref is found, can read: On May 23, Singapore customs agents arrested a couple that received 9,000 pirated DVDs and VCDs of ''Attack of the Clones'' that had been smuggled into the country from Malaysia. --&gt;

''Attack of the Clones'' was released on DVD and [[VHS]] on November 12, 2002. The DVD features an audio commentary from director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor and sound designer Ben Burtt, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]] animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow. Eight deleted scenes are included along with multiple documentaries, which include a full-length documentary about the creation of digital characters and two others that focus on sound design and the animatics team. Three featurettes examine the storyline, action scenes, and love story, and a set of 12 short web documentaries cover the overall production of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/release/video/f20021008/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043647/http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/release/video/f20021008/index.html |archivedate=January 5, 2008 |title=Episode II: Unlocking the DVD |publisher=Starwars.com |date=October 8, 2002 |accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Attack of the Clones'' DVD also features a trailer for a [[mockumentary]]-style short film known as ''R2-D2: Beneath the Dome''. Some stores offered the full mockumentary as an exclusive bonus disc for a small extra charge. The film gives an alternate look at the &quot;life&quot; of the droid [[R2-D2]]. The story, which Lucas approved, was meant to be humorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/release/video/news20021223.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108005407/http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/release/video/news20021223.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 |title=R2-D2: Beneath the Dome DVD |publisher=Starwars.com |date=December 23, 2002 |accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]], who had praised the previous ''Star Wars'' films, gave ''Episode II'' only two out of four stars, noting &quot;[As] someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films, I was amazed, at the end of ''Episode II'', to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable, memorable dialogue.&quot; About Anakin and Padme's relationship, Ebert stated, &quot;There is not a romantic word they exchange that has not long since been reduced to cliché.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot; /&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]], who also liked all of the previous installments, also awarded two stars out of four to this endeavor as well, as seen in his ''Movie and Video Guide'' from the 2002 edition onward. Maltin cited an &quot;overlong story&quot; as reason for his dissatisfaction and added &quot;Wooden characterizations and dialogue don't help.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leonard Maltin (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/reader/0451209400?_encoding=UTF8&amp;query=clones#reader_0451209400 |title=p. 1322 of 2004 edition |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107001432/http://www.amazon.com/reader/0451209400?_encoding=UTF8&amp;query=clones#reader_0451209400 |archive-date=November 7, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
The film grossed $310,676,740 in [[North America]] and $338,721,588 overseas for a worldwide total of $649,398,328. Though a box office success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box-office success of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' three years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mojo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) |url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0121765/ |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=June 9, 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CaUZ5Ivb?url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars2.htm |archive-date=December 1, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the top-grossing film of the year, either in North America (where it finished in third place) or worldwide (where it was fourth), the first time that a ''Star Wars'' film did not have this distinction. In North America it was outgrossed by ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', both of which were more favorably received by critics. Worldwide, it was also outgrossed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''. Adjusted for inflation, ''Attack of the Clones'' is the lowest-performing live-action ''Star Wars'' film at the North American box office, though is still among the [[List of highest-grossing films|100 highest-grossing films of all time]] when adjusted for inflation. It sold an estimated 52,012,300 tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars2.htm&amp;adjust_yr=1&amp;p=.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=May 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120348/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars2.htm&amp;adjust_yr=1&amp;p=.htm |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sulfur dioxide''' or '''sulphur dioxide''' ([[British English]]) is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula {{chem|[[sulfur|S]]|[[oxygen|O]]|2}}. It is a toxic [[gas]] responsible for the smell of burnt [[match]]es. It is released naturally by [[volcanic activity]] and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s contaminated with sulfur compounds.

== Structure and bonding ==

SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a bent molecule with ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[Point groups in three dimensions|symmetry point group]].
A [[valence bond theory]] approach considering just ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals would describe the bonding in terms of [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] between two resonance structures.
[[File:Sulfur-dioxide-resonance-2D.svg|center|upright=1.25|thumb|Two resonance structures of sulfur dioxide]]
The sulfur–oxygen bond has a [[bond order]] of 1.5. There is support for this simple approach that does not invoke ''d'' orbital participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On other planets, it can be found in various concentrations, the most significant being the [[atmosphere of Venus]], where it is the third-most significant atmospheric gas at 150 ppm. There, it condenses to form clouds, and is a key component of chemical reactions in the planet's atmosphere and contributes to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MarcqBertaux2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcq|first1=Emmanuel|last2=Bertaux|first2=Jean-Loup|last3=Montmessin|first3=Franck|last4=Belyaev|first4=Denis|title=Variations of sulphur dioxide at the cloud top of Venus's dynamic atmosphere|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|pages=25–28|year=2012|issn=1752-0894|doi=10.1038/ngeo1650|bibcode=2013NatGe...6...25M|s2cid=59323909}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been implicated as a key agent in the warming of early [[Mars]], with estimates of concentrations in the lower atmosphere as high as 100 ppm,&lt;ref name=&quot;HalevyZuber2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halevy|first1=I.|last2=Zuber|first2=M.

==Production==
Sulfur dioxide is primarily produced for sulfuric acid manufacture (see [[contact process]]). In the United States in 1979, 23.6 million tonnes (26,014,547 US short tons) of sulfur dioxide were used in this way, compared with 150 thousand tonnes (165,347 US short tons) used for other purposes. Most sulfur dioxide is produced by the combustion of elemental sulfur. Some sulfur dioxide is also produced by roasting [[pyrite]] and other sulfide ores in air.&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann| author = Müller, Hermann | title = Sulfur Dioxide | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a25_569}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:03. Горење на сулфур во атмосфера од кислород.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.25|An experiment showing burning of sulfur in oxygen. A flow-chamber joined to a gas washing bottle (filled with a solution of [[methyl orange]]) is being used. The product is sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with some traces of [[sulfur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The &quot;smoke&quot; that exits the gas washing bottle is, in fact, a sulfuric acid fog generated in a reaction.]]

===Combustion routes===
Sulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of [[sulfur]] or of burning materials that contain sulfur:

: S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ΔH = −297 kJ/mol

To aid combustion, liquified sulfur (140–150&amp;nbsp;°C, 284-302&amp;nbsp;°F) is sprayed through an atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur with a large surface area. The reaction is [[exothermic]], and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000–1600&amp;nbsp;°C (1832–2912&amp;nbsp;°F). The significant amount of heat produced is recovered by steam generation that can subsequently be converted to electricity.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

The combustion of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and organosulfur compounds proceeds similarly. For example:

: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] of sulfide ores such as [[pyrite]], [[sphalerite]], and [[cinnabar]] (mercury sulfide) also releases SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry, Fifth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company; New York, 2010; p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 4 FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  8 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: 2 ZnS  +  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; →   2 ZnO  +  2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: HgS  + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   Hg  +  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: 4 FeS + 7O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A combination of these reactions is responsible for the largest source of sulfur dioxide, volcanic eruptions.  These events can release millions of tonnes of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Reduction of higher oxides===
Sulfur dioxide can also be a byproduct in the manufacture of [[calcium silicate]] [[cement]]; [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is heated with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and sand in this process:

: 2 CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → 2 CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Until the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid and cement were produced by this process in [[Whitehaven]], England. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberated sulfur dioxide gas, used in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produced calcium silicate, a precursor in cement production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html WHITEHAVEN COAST ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY]. lakestay.co.uk (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

On a laboratory scale, the action of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on copper [[swarf|turnings]] produces sulfur dioxide.

: Cu  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===From sulphites===
Sulphites results by the action of aqueous base on sulfur dioxide:
: SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The reverse reaction occurs upon acidification:
: H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

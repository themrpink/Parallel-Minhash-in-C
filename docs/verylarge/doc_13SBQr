===Second Phase===
{{main|Operation Queen}}
The second phase was part of [[Operation Queen]], the Allied thrust to the [[Rur|Rur River]]. In this phase, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division was to clear the northern half of the forest between Schevenhütte and Hürtgen, capture Hürtgen, and advance to the Rur south of [[Düren]]. From 10 November, this would be VII Corps′ responsibility and it was part of the main VII Corps effort to reach the Rur. The 4th Division was now fully committed to the Hürtgen, although its 12th Infantry Regiment was already mauled from its action at Schmidt, leaving just two fully effective regiments to achieve the divisional objectives. U.S. VII Corps was opposed by German forces, mainly from the LXXXI Corps, consisting of three understrength divisions. In the Hürtgen, there was the 275th Infantry Division — 6,500 men with 150 artillery pieces. They were well dug-in and prepared.

The abstract of a U.S. report describes what happened:&lt;ref name=&quot;Huertgen_Forest_Deliberate_Attack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CSI Battlebook|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a151627.pdf |work=dtic.mil/|year=1984|accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The VII (U.S.) Corps, First Army attacked 16 November 1944, with 1st Inf Div, 4th Inf Div, 104th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD to clear [[Huertgen Forest]] and the path of First Army to the Rur River. After heavy fighting, primarily by the 4th Infantry Division, VII Corps' attack ground to a halt. V Corps was committed on 21 November 1944. Attacking with 8th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD, the V Corps managed to capture Huertgen after stiff fighting on 28 November 1944.}}

The attack started on 16 November. The two infantry regiments attacked in parallel columns: the 8th along the northern edge of the forest towards Düren, the 22nd further south in parallel. The open flanks invited infiltration. Similar tactics elsewhere in Hürtgen had &quot;invited disaster&quot;.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28303, Hürtgenwald, schweres Infanteriegeschütz.jpg|thumb|right|A German infantry gun firing in defense against a U.S. attack on 22 November 1944 in the Hürtgen forest]]

Attacks by the 8th Infantry Regiment on Rother Weh Creek hit heavy resistance and were repulsed with heavy losses. The 22nd failed to take Raven's Hedge (''Rabenheck''), beaten back by heavy machine-gun and artillery fire along the fire-breaks. After three days, there were 300 casualties, including numerous officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].

By 18 November, tanks were deemed essential, so engineers blasted tank routes through the forest. Communications and logistics remained a problem, so the next day the attack paused to allow re-supply and evacuation of the wounded. German reinforcements arrived from 344th and 353rd Infantry Divisions and resistance stiffened further.

Responsibility was returned to V Corps and, on 21 November, [[U.S. 8th Infantry Division|8th Division]] attacked the Weisser Weh Valley, continuing toward Hürtgen. The 121st Infantry Regiment hit heavy defenses immediately. Despite armored support from the 10th Tank Battalion, daily advances were less than {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Hürtgen was taken on 29 November and the battle continued to Kleinhau, {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} north.

[[File:Commemorative plaque at a house in Merode.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque at a house in Merode remembering the soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division lost in action at the Merode area 1944.]]The final action in the Hürtgen Forest was at [[Langerwehe|Langerwehe-Merode]], on the northeastern edge of the forest. Two American companies took the village, but they were later destroyed in a German counter-attack. More than 300 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division were killed in action on November 29 and 30, 1944.

Later, the secret daily report of the Supreme High Command of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] (''Oberkommando des Heeres'' (OKH)) of 27 November, stated that in the old Langerwehe penetration area, the U.S. Army (''enemy'') won terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fabianek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Fabianek|first= Paul|authorlink=|title=Folgen der Säkularisierung für die Klöster im Rheinland – Am Beispiel der Klöster Schwarzenbroich und Kornelimünster |publisher=BoD| year=2012|location=Aachen|url=|doi=|isbn=978-3-8482-1795-3}} pp. 25–26 incl. picture of the daily report of the Supreme High Command of the German Army&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of the 8th and the 28th Infantry Divisions then advanced on Brandenberg. The 28th Division — just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th) — also took heavy casualties during its stay in the Hürtgen Forest. On 14 November, the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|2nd Ranger]] Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of [[Hill 400, Bergstein|Hill 400]] from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the [[272nd Volksgrenadier Division]]. Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces. On the last day of the Hurtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marino|first1=James|title=Taking Hill 400: Army Rangers vs Fallschirmjägers|journal=Warfare History|date=October 3, 2016|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/taking-hill-400-army-rangers-vs-fallschirmjagers/#addcomments|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1–12 December, the 309th, 310th and 311th Infantry Regiments of the [[78th Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] (&quot;Lightning&quot;) relieved elements of the 1st Infantry Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl. On 13 December, these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bikerath, Germany, and were fighting the [[Battle of Kesternich]] against the [[272nd Volksgrenadier Division]] when General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area. On December 15 the 2nd battalion 309th Infantry was annihilated when the 272nd Volksgrenadiers counterattacked and took back Kesternich. The Germans knew that from the heights at Kesternich the Americans could detect the troop buildup for the Ardennes Offensive and place artillery there to fire on advancing German troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Edward G|title=Desperate Hours at Kesternich|journal=World War II Magazine|date=November 1996|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-desperate-hours-at-kesternich.htm/#addcomments|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military actions at the Siegfried Line up to 15 December alone brought death, injury or captivity to more than 250,000 soldiers from both sides. The First and Ninth U.S. Army suffered 57,039 battle casualties (dead, wounded, captured, missing in action); 71,654 non-battle casualties, i.e. accidents, diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[trench foot]], [[frostbite]], and [[Combat stress reaction|trauma]]. German Armed Forces are presumed to be 12,000 dead, 95,000 captured (documented), and an unknown number of wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdonald&quot;/&gt;{{rp|616}}

On 16 December 1944, German forces began the Ardennes Offensive, more commonly known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and as a result further fighting in the Hurtgen ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabecki&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Muddy road in the Hurtgen Forest.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A U.S. [[halftrack]] of the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry Regiment]]/1st U.S. Division in the Hürtgen Forest, 15 February 1945]]

The battle of the Hurtgen ended in a German defensive victory&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaloga&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergstrom/&gt; and the whole offensive was a dismal failure for the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabecki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1995) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans suffered 33,000 casualties during the course of the battle which ranged up to 55,000 casualties, included 9,000 non-combat losses and represented a 25 percent casualty rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zabecki&quot;/&gt; The Germans had also suffered heavy losses with 28,000 casualties — many of these were non combat and prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller188&quot;/&gt;

The surprise [[Battle of the Bulge|German Ardennes offensive]] caught Allied forces off guard. The Germans attacked with nearly 30 divisions; including the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS]], and the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS]] Panzer Divisions, with the northernmost point of the battlefront centered on Monschau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Hugh M.|title=The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge |date=1965|publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History Department of the Army |location=Washington, D.C.|page=86|edition=LC: 65-60001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They forced a large [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] in the American lines almost sixty miles deep at its maximum extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Hugh M.|title=The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge|date=1965|publisher=Department of the Army, Office of the Chief of Military History|location=Washington, D.C.|page=651|edition=LC, 65-60001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Germans never came close to their primary objective, the capture of [[Antwerp]]. The Ardennes Offensive came to a complete halt in early January, when German forces in the northern shoulder of the bulge were blocked by a strong American defence, the destruction of bridges by American engineers, and a lack of fuel.

In early February, American forces attacked through the Hürtgen Forest for the final time. On 10 February 1945, the Rur Dam was taken by American forces and the Forest itself was not cleared until the 17th when the [[82nd Airborne Division]] reached the Roer River.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Legacy==
There is a stone monument with a bronze plaque at the Hürtgen Military Cemetery, dedicated by veterans of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division to the memory of [[:de:Friedrich Lengfeld|Friedrich Lengfeld]] (29 September 1921 – 12 November 1944), a German lieutenant. Lengfeld died on 12 November 1944, of severe wounds sustained while helping a wounded American soldier out of the &quot;Wild Sow&quot; (&quot;''Wilde Sau''&quot;) minefield. It is the only such memorial for a German soldier placed by his erstwhile opponents in a German military cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bild:Lengfeld memorial.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial sculpture on Kall Bridge recalls that moment of humanity amidst the horrors of war. It was officially dedicated on the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire on the Kall Bridge, November 7, 2004. It was created by Michael Pohlmann, who commented:

{{bquote|I didn't want to create a monument to heroes, no theatrical representation, no pathos, but wanted to appear more unassumingly with a frugal shape, hewn in stone, dignifying the actual place of the incident. A place perhaps, at which once everything may have started rationally, then however, became more and more irrational and totally out of control until a return to sanity—or was it still emotion?—made a humanitarian encounter come true.}}

The plaque was created by the sculptor Tilman Schmitten, Eupen. The memorial sculpture and plaque were endowed by the Konejung Foundation: Culture&lt;ref name=&quot;Konejung Stiftung: Kultur&quot;/&gt;

The [[1944 Hürtgen Forest Museum]] was opened on 29 March 1983 in Kleinhau, in a stone barn to commemorate the battle.

==Historical analysis==
Historical discussion revolves around whether or not the American battle plan made any operational or tactical sense. One analysis&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands&quot;/&gt;{{rp|240–241}} is that the Allies under-estimated the strength and determination remaining in the psyche of the German soldier, believing his fighting spirit had collapsed under the stress of the [[Operation Cobra|Normandy breakout]] and the reduction of the [[Falaise Pocket]].

American commanders, in particular, misunderstood the impassability of the dense Hürtgen Forest, and its effects of reducing artillery effectiveness and making air support impracticable. The better alternative - breaking through south-east out into the open valley, where their advantages in mobility and airpower could come into play, and then heading northeast towards the actual objectives - seems not to have been really considered by the higher headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Guns at Last Light | url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805062908 | url-access= registration | author= Atkinson, Richard|year=2013|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805062908/page/320 320–324]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, American forces were concentrated in the village of Schmidt, and neither tried to conquer the strategic Rur Dams nor recognized the importance of [[Hill 400, Bergstein|Hill 400]] until an advanced stage of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-hurtgen-forest-fight-for-schmidt-and-kommerscheidt.htm |title=Hopes Dashed in the Hürtgen|authors=Miller, Edward G. &amp; [[David T.

{{About|a lexicographic error||Dord (disambiguation)}}
{{italic title}}
The word '''''dord''''' is a [[lexicographic error|dictionary error]] in [[lexicography]]. It was accidentally created, as a [[ghost word]], by the staff of G. and C. Merriam Company (now part of [[Merriam-Webster]]) in the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|New International Dictionary]]'', second edition (1934). That dictionary defined the term a synonym for density used in physics and chemistry in the following way:&lt;ref name=Eschner&gt;{{cite magazine| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-dord-180962266/ | title=As &quot;Dord&quot; Shows, Being in the Dictionary Doesn't Always Mean Something's a Word | first= Kat|last= Eschner | date=28 February 2017 | magazine=Smithsonian | access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''dord''' (dôrd), ''n. Physics &amp; Chem.'' Density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Dord: The Word That Didn't Exist |last=Mikkelson |first=David |work=Snopes.com |date=4 January 2015 |access-date=6 March 2019 |url= https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ghost-word/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Babcock Gove]], an editor at [[Merriam-Webster]] who became editor-in-chief of ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'', wrote a letter to the journal ''American Speech'', fifteen years after the error was caught, in which he explained how the &quot;dord&quot; error was introduced and corrected.&lt;ref name=&quot;gove&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first= Philip Babcock|last= Gove| authorlink= Philip Babcock Gove| title= The History of 'Dord'| work= [[American Speech]] | volume= 29 |year= 1954| pages= 136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 1931, Austin M. Patterson, the dictionary's [[chemistry]] editor, sent in a slip reading &quot;D or d, cont./density.&quot;  This was intended to add &quot;[[density]]&quot; to the existing list of words that the letter &quot;D&quot; can abbreviate. The phrase &quot;D or d&quot; was misinterpreted as a single, run-together word: ''Dord''. This was a plausible mistake, because headwords on slips were typed with spaces between the letters, so &quot;D&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;d&quot; looked very much like &quot;D&amp;nbsp;o&amp;nbsp;r&amp;nbsp;d&quot;. The original slip went missing, so a new slip was prepared for the printer, which assigned a [[part of speech]] ([[noun]]) and a [[pronunciation]]. The would-be word was not questioned or corrected by [[proofreader]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;gove&quot;/&gt; The entry appeared on page 771 of the dictionary around 1934, between the entries for [[Dorcopsis (genus)|Dorcopsis]] (a type of small kangaroo) and [[Doré bullion|doré]] (golden in color).&lt;ref name=Eschner/&gt;

On 28 February 1939, an editor noticed &quot;dord&quot; lacked an [[etymology]] and investigated, discovering the error. An order was sent to the printer marked &quot;plate change/imperative/urgent&quot;. The non-word &quot;dord&quot; was excised; &quot;density&quot; was added as an additional meaning for the abbreviation &quot;D or d&quot; as originally intended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/erroneous-word-dord-is-discovered-in-dictionary/ | title=Erroneous word &quot;Dord&quot; is discovered in dictionary | publisher=History Channel | access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of the adjacent entry &quot;[[Doré bar|Doré]] furnace&quot; was expanded from &quot;A furnace for refining dore [[bullion]]&quot; to &quot;a furnace in which dore bullion is refined&quot; to close up the space.  Gove wrote that this was &quot;probably too bad, for why shouldn't ''dord'' mean 'density'?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gove&quot;/&gt; In 1940, bound books began appearing without the [[ghost word]], although inspection of printed copies well into the 1940s show &quot;dord&quot; still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor-first= William Allan| editor-last= Neilson| collaboration= yes| title= dord| work= Webster's New International Dictionary| edition= Second| publisher= G. &amp; C.

==Etymology==

Ganja is a Hindi name for hemp, derived from the word ganjha, from the Sanskrit gañjā, referring to a &quot;powerful preparation from cannabis sativa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRCPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kranzler&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinmetz&quot; /&gt; The word was used in Europe as early as 1856, when the British enacted a tax on the &quot;ganja&quot; trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;PittNews&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pittnews.com/article/1195/opinions/pot-patois-a-comprehensive-etymology-of-marijuana/ |title=Pot patois: A comprehensive etymology of marijuana |last=Linder, Courtney |date=April 19, 2015 |website=[[The Pitt News]] |access-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403063353/https://pittnews.com/article/1195/opinions/pot-patois-a-comprehensive-etymology-of-marijuana/ |archive-date=April 3, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian mysticism}}

'''Edith Stein''' (religious name '''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Discalced Carmelites|OCD]]}}; also known as '''St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross''' or '''St. Edith Stein'''; 12 October 1891 – 9 August 1942) was a [[German Jewish]] philosopher who converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and became a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] [[nun]]. She is canonized as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]] of the Catholic Church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of [[Europe]].

She was born into an observant [[Jews|Jewish]] family, but had become an [[atheist]] by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of [[World War I]], in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1916, she obtained an assistantship there.

From reading the life of the reformer of the [[Carmelite Order]], Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]],&lt;ref&gt;Teresa de Avila, ''Libro de la vida''&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Stein was drawn to the Catholic faith. She was [[baptized]] on 1 January 1922 into the Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentor, the abbot of [[Beuron Archabbey]]. She then taught at a Catholic [[school of education]] in [[Speyer]]. As a result of the requirement of an &quot;[[Aryan certificate]]&quot; for [[civil servant]]s promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], she had to quit her teaching position.

Edith Stein was admitted as a postulant to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Cologne]] on 15 October, on the feast of Saint Teresa of Avila, and received the [[religious habit]] as a [[novice]] in April 1934, taking the [[religious name]] ''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce'' (Teresia in remembrance to Saint Teresa of Avila, Benedicta in honour of Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]. She made her temporary vows on April 21, 1935, and her perpetual vows on April 21, 1938.

The same year, Teresa Benedicta a Cruce and her biological sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern (tertiary of the Order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]], for their safety. In response to the pastoral letter from the Dutch bishops on July 26, 1942, in which they picked up the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis as a central theme, all baptized Catholics of Jewish origin (according to police reports 244 people) were arrested by the Gestapo on the following Sunday, 2 August 1942. They were sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where they died in the [[gas chamber]] on 9 August 1942.

==Early life==
Edith Stein was born in [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), [[Lower Silesia]], into an observant [[Jewish]] family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day of the [[Hebrew calendar]], which combined to make her a favorite of her mother.&lt;ref name=VNS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_19981011_edith_stein_en.html |title=Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein |work=Vatican News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an atheist.

Though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Edith to study at the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Breslau.

==Academic career==

In April 1913 Stein arrived at the [[University of Göttingen]] in order to study for the summer semester with [[Edmund Husserl]]. By the end of the summer she had decided to pursue her [[doctoral degree]] in philosophy under Husserl and chose [[empathy]] as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of [[World War I]]. She then served as a volunteer wartime [[Red Cross]] nurse in an infectious diseases hospital at [[Hranice (Přerov District)|Mährisch Weißkirchen]] in 1915. In 1916, Stein moved to the [[University of Freiburg]] in order to complete her dissertation on [[Empathy]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Magrì, Dermot Moran (eds.), ''Empathy, Sociality, and Personhood: Essays on Edith Stein's Phenomenological Investigations'', Springer, 2018, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stein, Edith, Saint, 1891-1942|title=On the problem of empathy|isbn=0-935216-11-1|edition=Third Revised|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=19324020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before receiving her degree from Freiburg she agreed to become Husserl's assistant there.

While Stein had earlier contacts with Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic [[Teresa of Ávila]] during summer holidays in [[Bad Bergzabern]] in 1921 that prompted her conversion and eventually the desire to seek the life of a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]]. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the enclosed and hidden life of a Carmelite nun, Stein obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in [[Speyer]] from 1923 to 1931. While there, Stein translated [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''De Veritate'' (''Of Truth'') into [[German language|German]], familiarized herself with Catholic philosophy in general, and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to [[Thomism]]. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church-affiliated Institute for Scientific [[Pedagogy]] in [[Münster]], but [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] legislation passed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]] forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to [[Pope Pius XI]], she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime &quot;to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name.&quot;

{{quote|
As a child of the Jewish people who, by the grace of God, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the Catholic Church, I dare to speak to the Father of Christianity about that which oppresses millions of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor. For years the leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of the Jews. … But the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings.

Everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself 'Christian'. For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name. Is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy? Isn't the effort to destroy Jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our Savior, of the most blessed Virgin and the apostles? Is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our Lord and Savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors? And isn't this a black mark on the record of this Holy Year which was intended to be a year of peace and reconciliation? We all, who are faithful children of the Church and who see the conditions in Germany with open eyes, fear the worst for the prestige of the Church, if the silence continues any longer.

Her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever saw it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/this-europe-letters-reveal-auschwitz-victims-plea-to-pope-pius-xi-598301.html |title=This Europe: Letters reveal Auschwitz victim's plea to Pope Pius XI |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=21 February 2003 |location=London |first=Peter |last=Popham |date=21 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' (''With Burning Anxiety''), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.

==Discalced Carmelite nun and martyr==
Stein entered the [[Discalced Carmelite]] monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in [[Cologne]]-Lindenthal in 1933 and took the [[religious name]] ''Teresia Benedicta a Cruce'' (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). In Cologne she wrote her [[metaphysical]] book ''Endliches und ewiges Sein'' (''Finite and Eternal Being''), which attempted to combine the philosophies of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]] and Husserl.

To avoid the growing [[Nazism|Nazi]] threat, the Order transferred Edith and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in [[Echt, Limburg|Echt]], [[Netherlands]]. There she wrote ''Studie über Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft'' (&quot;Studies on [[John of the Cross]]: The Science of the Cross&quot;). In her testament of 9 June 1939&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-this-day-jewish-convert-beatified-1.5246811&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote: &quot;I beg the Lord to take my life and my death … for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy church, especially for the preservation of our holy order, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by his own people and his kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray.&quot;

Stein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52&quot;&gt;Mosley, J. (2006). The Ultimate Sacrifice. In Edith Stein: Modern Saint and Martyr (pp. 43-52). Mahwah, N.J.: HiddenSpring.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going so far as to write the Prioress to request her permission to &quot;allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace&quot; and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began &quot;quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger&quot; after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52&quot;/&gt;

Ultimately, she would not be safe in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|Dutch Bishops' Conference]] had a public statement read in all churches across the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi [[racism]]. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the [[Reichskommissar]] of the Netherlands, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands, Stein was arrested by the [[SS]] on 2 August 1942. Stein and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] and [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edith Stein Convert, Nun, Martyr

Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: &quot;If somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosley, J. 2006 pp. 43-52&quot;/&gt;

On 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. It was probably on 9 August that Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, her sister Rosa, and many more of her people were killed in a mass [[gas chamber]].&lt;ref name=VNS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=María Ruiz |last=Scaperlanda |title=Edith Stein: St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross |place=Huntington, Indiana |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Press |year=2001 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and veneration==

Teresa Benedicta of the Cross was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in [[Cologne]], Germany, by [[Pope John Paul II]] and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in [[Rome]]. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of [[paracetamol]] ([[acetaminophen]]), which causes [[Hepatic vein|hepatic]] [[necrosis]]. The young girl's father, [[Emmanuel Charles McCarthy]], a priest of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], immediately called together relatives and prayed for Teresa's intercession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewish-born nun gassed by Nazis is declared saint; Prayer to Edith Stein sparked tot's 'miraculous' recovery |date=24 May 1997 |work=Toronto Star |pages=A22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: &quot;I was willing to say that it was miraculous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto&quot;/&gt; McCarthy would later attend Sr. Teresa Benedicta's canonization.

Teresa Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six [[patron saint]]s of [[Europe]], together with [[Benedict of Nursia]], [[Cyril and Methodius]], [[Bridget of Sweden]], and [[Catherine of Siena]].

Today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ess-darmstadt.de |publisher=Ess-darmstadt.de |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012|title=Edith-Stein-Schule Darmstadt }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hengelo]], [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edithsteincollege.nl/|title=Edith Stein College - VWO|publisher=Edith Stein College}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpcdsb.org/STEIN |title=St. Edith Stein Elementary School |publisher=Dpcdsb.org |date= |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the [[University of Tübingen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edith-stein-heim.de/ |title=Edith-Stein-Studentinnen-Wohnheim |publisher=Edith-stein-heim.de |date= |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a classroom building at [[The College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].

The philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] published a book in 2006 titled ''Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922'', in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]], whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a &quot;bifurcation of personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;macstein&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xpe4WJX8kV8C&amp;q=Edith+Stein+Alasdair+MacIntyre |first1=Alasdair C. |last1=MacIntyre |title=Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913–1922 |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |location=Lanham, Md |year=2006 |page=5 |isbn=9780742559530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright Arthur Giron wrote ''Edith Stein'', a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samuelfrench.com/p/508/edith-stein|title=Edith Stein &amp;#124; Samuel French|website=samuelfrench.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Hungarian film director [[Márta Mészáros]] made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title ''[[The Seventh Chamber|A hetedik szoba]]'' (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring [[Maia Morgenstern]].

In 1999, a memorial statue by German sculptor Bert Gerresheim was dedicated in Cologne, Germany. The statue comprises three different views of Stein reflecting her Jewish and Christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust.

In 2007, Stein's life and work was dramatised in the novel ''Winter Under Water'' (Picador, London) by author James Hopkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tague|first=John|date=28 January 2007|title=Winter Under Water, by James Hopkin|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/winter-under-water-by-james-hopkin-434041.html|url-status=live|access-date=15 August 2020|website=The Independent|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a memorial ''[[Stolperstein]]'' ({{lang-pl|kamienie pamięci}}) was placed near Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstrasse) in Wrocław.

In 2009 her [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] was installed at the [[Walhalla Memorial]] near [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]]. In June 2009 the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edithsteincircle.com |title=The International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein |work=edithsteincircle.com|publisher=Edith Stein Circle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of [[D-Day]], a bell dedicated to her was named by [[Prince Charles]] at [[Bayeux]] Cathedral.

Also in 2014, the book ''Edith Stein and [[Regina Jonas]]: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps'', by Emily Leah Silverman, was published.

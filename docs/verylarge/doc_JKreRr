Several Chuck Jones films in the late 1940s and 1950s depict Bugs travelling via cross-country (and, in some cases, intercontinental) tunnel-digging, ending up in places as varied as Barcelona, Spain (''[[Bully for Bugs]]''), the [[Himalayas]] (''[[The Abominable Snow Rabbit]]''), and [[Antarctica]] (''[[Frigid Hare]]'') all because he &quot;knew (he) shoulda taken that left toin at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albukoikee]].&quot; He first utters that phrase in ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945), when he emerges in the [[Black Forest]], a cartoon seldom seen today due to its blatantly topical subject matter. When [[Hermann Göring]] says to Bugs, &quot;There is no Las Vegas in 'Chermany'&quot; and takes a potshot at Bugs, Bugs dives into his hole and says, &quot;Joimany! Yipe!&quot;, as Bugs realizes he is behind enemy lines. The confused response to his &quot;left toin&quot; comment also followed a pattern. For example, when he tunnels into Scotland in ''[[My Bunny Lies over the Sea]]'' (1948), while thinking he is heading for the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], it provides another chance for an ethnic joke: &quot;Therrre arrre no La Brrrea Tarrr Pits in Scotland!&quot; (to which Bugs responds, &quot;Scotland!? Eh...what's up, Mac-doc?&quot;). A couple of late-1950s/early-1960s cartoons of this ilk also featured Daffy Duck travelling with Bugs (&quot;Hey, wait a minute! Since when is [[Pismo Beach, California|Pismo Beach]] inside a cave?&quot;).

==Voice actors==
The following are the various vocal artists who have voiced Bugs Bunny over the last 80 years for both Warner Bros. official productions and others:
===Mel Blanc===
[[Image:Mel Blanc - 1959.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Mel Blanc was the original voice of Bugs and voiced the character for nearly five decades.]]
[[Mel Blanc]] voiced the character for almost 50 years, from Bugs' debut in the 1940 short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' until Blanc's death in 1989. Blanc described the voice as a combination of [[the Bronx|Bronx]] and [[Brooklyn]] accents; however, [[Tex Avery]] claimed that he asked Blanc to give the character not a New York accent ''per se'', but a voice like that of actor [[Frank McHugh]], who frequently appeared in supporting roles in the 1930s and whose voice might be described as [[Irish Americans|New York Irish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age|last=Barrier|first=Michael|date=November 6, 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0-19-516729-0|page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bugs' second cartoon ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'', Blanc created a completely new voice for Bugs, which sounded like a [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] impression, but the directors decided the previous voice was better. Though Blanc's best known character was the carrot-chomping rabbit, munching on the carrots interrupted the dialogue. Various substitutes, such as [[celery]], were tried, but none of them ''sounded'' like a carrot. So, for the sake of expedience, Blanc munched and then spit the carrot bits into a [[spittoon]], rather than swallowing them, and continued with the dialogue. One often-repeated story, which dates back to the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/warner-club-news-1944/ &quot;Warner Club News (1944)&quot;]. Retrieved July 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; is that Blanc was allergic to carrots and ''had'' to spit them out to minimize any allergic reaction — but his autobiography makes no such claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanc&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Blanc|first1=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-51244-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thatsnotallfolks00blan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in a 1984 interview with [[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]], co-author of ''The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Voice Actors'', Blanc emphatically denied being allergic to carrots.

==Comics==
===Comic books===
Bugs Bunny was continuously featured in comic books for more than 40 years, from 1941 to 1983, and has appeared sporadically since then. Bugs first appeared in [[comic books]] in 1941, in ''[[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Comics]]'' #1, published by [[Dell Comics]]. Bugs was a recurring star in that book all through its 153-issue run, which lasted until July 1954. [[Western Publishing]] (and its [[Dell Comics|Dell]] imprint) published 245 issues of a Bugs Bunny comic book from Dec. 1952/Jan. 1953 to 1983. The company also published 81 issues of the joint title ''[[Yosemite Sam]] and Bugs Bunny'' from December 1970 to 1983. During the 1950s Dell also published a number of Bugs Bunny spinoff titles.

Creators on those series included [[Chase Craig]], [[Helen Houghton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=HOUGHTON%2c+HELEN Houhgton entry], ''Who's Who of American Comics Books, 1928–1999''.

The German publisher Condor published a 76-issues Bugs Bunny series (translated and reprinted from the American comics) in the mid-1970s. The Danish publisher [[Egmont Ehapa]] produced a weekly reprint series in the mid-1990s.

===Comic strip===
The ''Bugs Bunny'' [[comic strip]] ran for almost 50 years, from January 10, 1943 to December 30, 1990, syndicated by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]]. It started out as a [[Sunday page]] and added a daily strip on November 1, 1948.&lt;ref name=Holtz&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip originated with [[Chase Craig]], who did the first five weeks before leaving for military service in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/c/craig_chase.htm Craig entry], Lambiek's ''Comiclopedia''.

Like [[Mickey Mouse]] for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], Bugs Bunny has served as the mascot for [[Warner Bros.]] and its various divisions. According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', Bugs has appeared in more films (both short and feature-length) than any other cartoon [[Character (arts)|character]], and is the ninth most portrayed film personality in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness&quot;/&gt; On December 10, 1985, Bugs became the second cartoon character (after Mickey) to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood&quot;/&gt;

He also has been a pitchman for companies including [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Nike commercials with [[Michael Jordan]] as &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; for the Air Jordan VII and VIII became precursors to ''[[Space Jam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Sc61UtYUgbs|title=1992 - Nike - Michael Jordan &amp; Bugs Bunny}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=2URMB4NGbo8|title=1993 - Nike - Michael Jordan &amp; Bugs Bunny}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he has spent time as an honorary member of [[Jordan Brand]], including having Jordan's Jumpman logo done in his image. In 2015, as part of the 30th anniversary of Jordan Brand, Nike released a mid-top Bugs Bunny version of the Air Jordan I, named the &quot;Air Jordan Mid 1 Hare&quot;, along with a women's equivalent inspired by [[Lola Bunny]] called the &quot;Air Jordan Mid 1 Lola&quot;, along with a commercial featuring Bugs and [[Ahmad Rashad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.nike.com/news/bugs-bunny-details-his-relationship-and-latest-partnership-with-michael-jordan ''Bugs Bunny Shares the Scoop on his Latest Partnership with Michael Jordan''] Nike&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' compiled a list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time as part of the magazine's 50th anniversary. Bugs Bunny was given the honor of number 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNBugs&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bugs Bunny tops greatest cartoon characters list |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |publisher=CNN.com |date=July 30, 2002 |accessdate=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208043937/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters/index.html |archivedate=February 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=CNN.com |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html |title=List of All-time Cartoon Characters |accessdate=April 11, 2007 |date=July 30, 2002 |publisher=CNN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603034915/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html |archivedate=June 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[CNN]] broadcast on July 31, 2002, a ''TV Guide'' editor talked about the group that created the list. The editor also explained why Bugs pulled top billing: &quot;His stock...has never gone down...Bugs is the best example...of the smart-aleck American comic. He not only is a great cartoon character, he's a great comedian. He was written well. He was drawn beautifully. He has thrilled and made many generations laugh.

They attribute this to, &quot;their ability to constantly flip the script on their unwitting counterparts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/eric-andres-nearest-comedic-equivalent-may-be-bugs-bunn-1820120833|title=Eric Andre's nearest comedic equivalent may be Bugs Bunny|last=Neilan|first=Dan|work=The A.V.

===Language===
American use of the term ''[[Nimrod]]'' to mean &quot;idiot&quot; is attributed (in ''[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]'') entirely to Bugs's expostulation &quot;What a Nimrod!&quot; to describe the inept hunter Elmer Fudd.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Bryan A. (3rd Edition, 2009). ''Garner's Modern American Usage'', p. liii. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-538275-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct. Please do not change to &quot;Toons&quot;. --&gt;''{{'}} name was inspired by [[Walt Disney]]'s musical series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''. They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as [[Bosko]] and, after losing him, [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, following their addition of directors [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Voice acting|voice actor]] [[Mel Blanc]]. From 1942 to 1964, ''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct. Please do not change to &quot;Toons&quot;. --&gt;'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;AniUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros.

''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct. Please do not change to &quot;Toons&quot;. --&gt;'' has since become a worldwide media franchise, spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides, as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, films, and advertisements. The most famous ''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct. Please do not change to &quot;Toons&quot;. --&gt;'' character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a [[cultural icon]] and has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=https://walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny/|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct.

Rabbit, Duck!]]''), ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''), and five (''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'', ''[[Birds Anonymous]]'', ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' and ''[[For Scent-imental Reasons]]'') have won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/24/greatest-cartoons-all-time-tv-guide-list/ | work=[[Fox News]] | title=TV Guide magazine's 60 greatest cartoons of all time | date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On the inception, ''Looney Tunes&lt;!-- &quot;Tunes&quot; is correct. Please do not change to &quot;Toons&quot;. --&gt;'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' drew their storylines from Warner's vast music library. Between 1934 and 1943, ''Merrie Melodies'' were produced in color and ''Looney Tunes'' in black and white. After 1943, both series were produced in color and became virtually indistinguishable, varying only in their opening theme music and titles. Both series made use of the various Warner Bros. cartoon characters. By 1937, the theme music for ''Looney Tunes'' was &quot;[[The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down]]&quot; by [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Dave Franklin]], and the theme music for ''Merrie Melodies'' was an adaptation of &quot;[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]&quot; by [[Charles Tobias]], Murray Mencher and [[Eddie Cantor]].

=== 1930–1933: Harman and Ising era ===
In 1929, to compete against [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse short cartoons]], Warner Bros. became interested in developing a series of animated shorts to promote their music. They had recently acquired [[Brunswick Records]] along with four music publishers for US$28&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|28|1930|fmt=c}} million in {{currentyear}}) and were eager to promote this material for the sales of sheet music and phonograph records. Warner made a deal with [[Leon Schlesinger]] to produce cartoons for them. Schlesinger hired [[Rudolf Ising]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to produce the first series of cartoons. Schlesinger was impressed by Harman's and Ising's 1929 pilot cartoon, ''[[Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid]]''. The first ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Sinkin' in the Bathtub]]'' starring [[Bosko]], which was released in 1930.&lt;ref name=bcdb /&gt;

[[File:Clampett-Porky.jpg|thumbnail|220px|left|[[Porky Pig]] in the intro to one of the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts in the late 1930s and early 1940s]]

=== 1933–1936: Leon Schlesinger Productions ===
When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. in 1933 over a budget dispute with Schlesinger, they took with them all the rights of the characters and cartoons they had created. A new character called [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]] became the only star of the ''Looney Tunes'' series for a couple of years.

New directors including [[Tex Avery]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Bob Clampett]] were brought in or promoted to work with animators in the Schlesinger studio, with Avery's unit housed in a bungalow the animators dubbed &quot;[[Termite Terrace]].&quot; In 1935 they debuted the first major ''Looney Tunes'' star, [[Porky Pig]], along with [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans the Cat]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon ''[[I Haven't Got a Hat]]'' directed by Friz Freleng. Beans was the star of the next Porky/Beans cartoon ''[[Golddiggers of '49]]'', but it was Porky who emerged as the star instead of Beans. The ensemble characters of ''I Haven't Got a Hat'', such as Oliver Owl, and twin dogs Ham and Ex, were also given a sampling of shorts, but Beans and Porky proved much more popular. Beans was later phased out when his popularity declined, leaving Porky as the only star of the Schlesinger studio.

=== 1936–1944: More star characters and switch to color ===
The debuts of other memorable ''Looney Tunes'' stars followed: [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), [[Elmer Fudd]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), and [[Bugs Bunny]] in the ''Merrie Melodies'' short ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare|first=Joe|last=Adamson|year=1990|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-1855-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bugsbunnyfiftyye0000adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugs initially starred in the color ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts following the success of 1940's ''A Wild Hare'', and formally joined the ''Looney Tunes'' series with the release of ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' in 1944. Schlesinger began to phase in the production of color ''Looney Tunes'' with the 1942 cartoon ''[[The Hep Cat]]''. The final black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short was ''[[Puss n' Booty]]'' in 1943 directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The inspiration for the changeover was Warner's decision to re-release only the color cartoons in the ''[[Blue Ribbon Classic]]s'' series of ''Merrie Melodies''. Bugs made a cameo appearance in 1942 in the Avery/Clampett cartoon ''Crazy Cruise'' and also at the end of the Frank Tashlin 1943 cartoon ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'', which marked Bugs' only official appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' short. Schlesinger sold his interest in the cartoon studio in 1944 to Warner Bros. and went into retirement; he died five years later.

=== 1944–1964: Golden Age ===
More popular ''Looney Tunes'' characters were created (most of which first appeared in ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons) such as [[Tweety]] (debuted in 1942's ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]''), [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Life with Feathers]]''), [[Yosemite Sam]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Hare Trigger]]''), [[Pepé Le Pew]] (debuted in 1945's ''[[Odor-able Kitty]]''), [[Foghorn Leghorn]] (debuted in 1946's ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]''), [[Marvin the Martian]] (debuted in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''), [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]] (debuted in 1949's ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]''), [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (debuted in 1950's ''[[Canary Row]]''), [[Speedy Gonzales]] (debuted in 1953's ''[[Cat-Tails for Two|Cat Tails for Two]]''), [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]''), and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|the Tasmanian Devil]] (debuted in 1954's ''[[Devil May Hare]]'').

=== 1964–1969: DePatie–Freleng and Seven Arts era ===
During the mid-late 1960s, the shorts were produced by [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises]] (and [[Format Films|Format Productions]]) (1964–1967) and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] (1967–1969) after Warner Bros. shut down their animation studio. The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized [[limited animation]] and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by [[William Lava]], of &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot;. The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves.

The original ''Looney Tunes'' theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being ''[[Bugged by a Bee]]'', by [[Robert McKimson]]).&lt;ref name=bcdb /&gt;

=== 1970–1999: Syndication and Return to Television &amp; Film ===
The ''Looney Tunes'' series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on network and [[syndicated television]] in the 1950s, under various titles and formats. However, the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were edited, removing scenes of violence (particularly suicidal gags and scenes of characters doing dangerous stunts that impressionable viewers could easily imitate), racial and ethnic caricatures (including stereotypical portrayals of [[African-Americans]], [[Mexicans]], [[Jews]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Asians]], and [[Germans]] as [[Nazis]]), and questionable vices (such as smoking [[cigarettes]], ingesting [[pill (pharmacy)|pill]]s, and drinking [[alcohol]]).

Theatrical animated shorts went dormant until 1987, when new shorts were made to introduce ''Looney Tunes'' to a new generation of audiences. [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970–present and miscellaneous)|New shorts]] have been produced and released sporadically for theaters since then, usually as promotional tie-ins with various family movies produced by Warner Bros. While many of them have been released in limited releases theatrically for Academy Award consideration, only a few have gotten theatrical releases with movies.

In the 1970s through the early 1990s, several feature-film compilations and [[television specials]] were produced, mostly centering on Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck, with a mixture of new and old footage. In 1976, the ''Looney Tunes'' characters made their way into the amusement business when they became the mascots for the two Marriott's Great America theme parks (Gurnee and Santa Clara). After the [[Six Flags Great America|Gurnee park]] was sold to [[Six Flags]], they also claimed the rights to use the characters at the other Six Flags parks, which they continue to do presently. In 1988, several ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in cameo roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The more notable cameos featured Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Yosemite Sam. It is the only time in which ''Looney Tunes'' characters have shared screen time with their rivals at Disney (producers of the film)—particularly in the scenes where Bugs and [[Mickey Mouse]] are skydiving, and when Daffy and [[Donald Duck]] are performing their &quot;Dueling Pianos&quot; sequence.

[[Nickelodeon]] aired all the unaired cartoons in a show called ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' between 1988 and 1999. To date, ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon'' is the longest-airing [[animated series]] on the network that was not a [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoon]]. In 1996, ''[[Space Jam]]'', a feature film mixing animation and live-action, was released to theaters starring Bugs Bunny and basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]. Despite a mixed critical reception,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/ &quot;Movie Reviews: Space Jam&quot;.] Retrieved on January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the film was a major box-office success, grossing nearly $100&amp;nbsp;million in the U.S. alone, almost becoming the first non-Disney animated film to achieve that feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3849356801/weekend/|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a two-year period, it was the highest grossing non-Disney animated film ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;JerryBeck&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who subsequently became another recurring member of the ''Looney Tunes'' cast, usually as a love interest for Bugs.

In 1997, Bugs Bunny was featured on a U.S. 32 cent postage stamp; the first of five ''Looney Tunes'' themed stamps to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Looney Tunes'' also achieved success in the area of television during this era, with appearances in several originally produced series, including ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991, starring Taz) and ''[[The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995, starring Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny). The gang also made frequent cameos in the 1990 spinoff series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', from executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], where they played teachers and mentors to a younger generation of cartoon characters ([[Plucky Duck]], [[Hamton J. Pig]], [[Babs and Buster Bunny]], etc.), plus occasional cameos in the later Warner shows ''[[Animaniacs]]'' (also from Spielberg) and ''[[Histeria!]]''.

=== 2000–present ===
In late 2000, Warner decided to make the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' library exclusive to fellow Time Warner properties, specifically [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]. Immediately prior to this decision, ''Looney Tunes'' shorts were airing on several networks at once: on Cartoon Network, on Nickelodeon (as ''Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon''), and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (as ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show|The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''). The latter two had been particularly long-running series, and the Warner Bros. decision forced the two networks to cancel the programs. In 2003, another feature film was released, this time in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original shorts: the live-action/animated ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''. Although the film wasn't financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3043067393/ ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''.] ''Boxofficemojo.com''. Retrieved on January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it was met with mixed-to-positive reviews from film critics and has been argued by animation historians and fans as the finest original feature-length appearance of the cartoon characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;JerryBeck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031114/REVIEWS/311140303/1023|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=October 29, 2012|date=November 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/moviesarchives/2003/1103/031121.html|title=Joe Dante Calls the Toon|year=2003|newspaper=Chicago Reader|accessdate=January 25, 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Edelstein|title=Movie Review: ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action''|work        = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=slate.com|date=November 14, 2003|url= http://slate.msn.com/id/2091232/|accessdate=February 2, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032701/http://slate.msn.com/id/2091232/|archivedate=April 8, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Warner Home Video]] released a new and Christmas-themed ''Looney Tunes'' direct-to-video film called ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'', a parody of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. Other ''Looney Tunes'' TV series made during this time were ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (2002–05), ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' (2003-05) and ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' (2005–07).

On October 22, 2007, ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons became available for the first time in [[High-definition television|High-definition]] via [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] service, including some in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= From Looney Tunes and iCarly to Shrek and SpongeBob SquarePants, Xbox 360 Launches Massive Library of Family Games and Entertainment |publisher= [[Microsoft]] |date= October 22, 2007 |url= https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-22XboxFamilyContentPR.mspx |accessdate= November 6, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161629/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-22XboxFamilyContentPR.mspx |archive-date= June 4, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 29 – May 18, 2008, many ''Looney Tunes'' artifacts, including original animation cels and concept drawings, were on display at the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], just off the campus of [[Youngstown State University]], near where the Warners lived early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vindy.com/news/2008/feb/24/butler-goes-looney-tunes/ |title=Youngstown News, Butler Institute goes Looney Tunes |publisher=Vindy.com |date=February 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504094244/http://www.vindy.com/news/2008/feb/24/butler-goes-looney-tunes/ |archive-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 Cartoon Network upfront, ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animationguildblog.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/at-toon-factory-of-brothers-warner.html|title=TAG Blog: At the 'Toon Factory of the Brothers Warner|work=animationguildblog.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several delays, the series premiered on May 3, 2011. Produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], the series centers on Bugs and Daffy as they leave the woods and move to the suburbs with &quot;colorful neighbors&quot; including Sylvester, Tweety, Granny, Yosemite Sam, etc. The series introduced the character [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters#Tina Russo|Tina Russo]], a duck who becomes Daffy's girlfriend. The show also features 2-minute music videos titled respectfully &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; (as a tribute to the ''Looney Tunes'' sister shorts) which features the characters singing original songs, as well as CGI animated shorts starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner (which were removed after the first season). The series was cancelled after its second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/FrantzEdCharles/status/493806183195504641|title=No Season 3 for the Looney Tunes Show|author=FrantzEdCharles|date=July 29, 2014|work=Twitter|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner returned to the big screen in a series of 3-D shorts that preceded select Warner Bros. films. There were six in the works that began with the first short, ''[[Coyote Falls]]'', that preceded the film ''[[Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore]]'', which was released on July 30, 2010. On September 24, 2010, ''[[Fur of Flying]]'' preceded the film, ''[[Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole]]'', and on December 17, 2010, ''[[Rabid Rider]]'' preceded the film, ''[[Yogi Bear (film)|Yogi Bear]]''. On June 8, 2011, Warner Bros. Animation announced that there will be more ''Looney Tunes'' 3-D theatrical shorts; the first titled ''[[Daffy's Rhapsody]]'' with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, the next being ''[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]'' with Sylvester, Tweety,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Granny. ''Daffy's Rhapsody'' was to precede the film ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=78492 |title=More 3D Looney Tunes Shorts On The Way |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the studio decided to premiere ''[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]'' instead.

At the 2014 Cartoon Network upfront, another series titled ''[[New Looney Tunes|Wabbit: A Looney Tunes Production]]'' (later ''New Looney Tunes'') was announced.&lt;ref name=WabbitVariety&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|title=Cartoon Network To Launch First Mini-Series, New Takes on Tom &amp; Jerry, Bugs Bunny|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/cartoon-network-to-launch-first-mini-series-new-takes-on-tom-jerry-bugs-bunny-1201128603/|work=Variety.com|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring Bugs Bunny, the series premiered on both Cartoon Network and its sister channel [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] in Fall 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/bugs-bunny-scooby-doo-boomerang-1201530384|title=Bugs Bunny, Scooby Doo Return To Boost Boomerang |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has had an unusually slow rollout, with the series having moved to the Boomerang streaming service in 2017, and was eventually cancelled on January 30, 2020.

On June 11, 2018, another series, titled ''[[Looney Tunes Cartoons]]'', was announced by Warner Bros. Animation. It premiered on May 27, 2020, on the streaming service [[HBO Max]]. Its first season features &quot;1,000 minutes of new one-to-six minute cartoons featuring the brand's marquee characters&quot;, voiced by their current voice actors in &quot;simple, gag-driven and visually vibrant stories&quot; that are rendered by multiple artists employing &quot;a visual style that will resonate with fans&quot;, most noticeably having a style reminiscent of the styles of [[Tex Avery]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Robert McKimson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline hbomax&quot;/&gt; According to co-executive producer [[Peter Browngardt]], &quot;We're not doing guns, but we can do cartoony violence — TNT, the Acme stuff.

=== Home media ===
In the 1980s, the shorts received [[VHS]] releases, with the pre-August 1948 shorts released by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] and the post-July 1948 shorts released by [[Warner Home Video]]. In 2003, Warner Home Video began releasing select shorts on [[DVD]], aimed at collectors, in four-disc sets known as the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]''. This continued until 2008, when [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|the final volume of the Golden Collection]] was released. Then in 2010 until 2013, the company released the ''[[Looney Tunes Super Stars]]'' DVDs. There have been numerous complaints regarding the ''Super Stars'' releases however, particularly the first two, having the post-1953 shorts in a 16:9 widescreen format. The last DVD in the ''Super Stars'' series was ''[[Looney Tunes Super Stars' Sylvester and Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem|Sylvester and Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem]]'', released on April 23, 2013. 2010 and 2011 saw the releases of ''[[The Essential Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[The Essential Daffy Duck]]'' DVDs. In 2011, the shorts were released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] for the first time with the ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection]]'' series. On September 19, 2017, [[Warner Home Video]]'s [[Warner Archive Collection]] released the five-disc ''Porky Pig 101'' DVD-set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/warnerarchive/posts/10155621100166563&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing and ownership ==
In 1933, [[Harman and Ising]] left, taking the rights to the [[Bosko|Bosko characters]] with them. However, Warner retained the rights to the cartoons and the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' brand names, leaving their former producer Leon Schlesinger to start his own Warner Bros. studio and continue the ''Looney Tunes'' series. With their retained Bosko rights Harman and Ising began making cartoons at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1934, until they were fired in 1937 due to a lack of success. MGM proceeded to form their own studio to create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoons]]. Time Warner eventually acquired the Bosko characters from Harman and Ising's estates. Meanwhile, the Schlesinger studio continued to make popular cartoons until 1944 when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. Since then, Warner Bros. has owned all rights to all post-1933 characters created by Leon Schlesinger Productions and Warner Bros. Cartoons. The rights to individual cartoons however are in other hands.

In 1955, Warner Bros. sold the television distribution rights to 191 of its cartoons (which included the black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' and the black-and-white ''Merrie Melodies'' made after Harman and Ising left) to Guild Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|date=2005-09-03|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DRYEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5 6]|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyrights to those cartoons were assigned to [[Sunset Productions]], an entity owned by Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety197-1955-02/page/n185/mode/2up|title=Guild Acquires 191 WB Cartoons|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1955-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLNkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA176|title=Hollywood TV: The Studio System in the Fifties|isbn=9780292730595|last1=Anderson|first1=Christopher|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons were distributed by Guild Films until it went bankrupt and was bought by Seven Arts. Seven Arts bought WB in 1970, and WB regained the TV distribution rights to the black and white cartoons.

In 1956, [[Associated Artists Productions]] (a.a.p.) acquired television distribution rights to most of Warner Bros' pre-1950&lt;ref name=&quot;ymrt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story|year=2008|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; library, including all ''Merrie Melodies'' (except for those sold to Guild and ''Lady, Play Your Mandolin!'') and color ''Looney Tunes'' shorts that were released prior to August 1948. Unlike the previous TV package, this package had the Warner titles kept intact and an &quot;Associated Artists Productions presents&quot; title inserted at the head of each reel (as a result, each ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon had the song &quot;[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]&quot; playing twice).&lt;ref name=&quot;geocities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/argussventon/cartoondistributors/aap/aap.html |title=WHAT DID YOU SEE THIS MORNING?

(which has also bought Paramount's ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' films) who merged the company into its television division, [[United Artists Television]]. In 1981, UA was sold to MGM, and five years later, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the pre-May 1986 MGM library, as well the rights to the a.a.p. library. In 1996, Turner's company, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (whose [[Turner Entertainment]] division oversaw the film library), was purchased by Time Warner (now [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]) who also owned Warner Bros. Today, [[Warner Home Video]] holds the video rights to the entire ''Looney Tunes''/''Merrie Melodies'' animated output by virtue of Warner Bros.' ownership of Turner Entertainment.

Starting in 1960, the cartoons were repackaged into several different TV programs that remained popular for several decades before being purchased by Turner Broadcasting System.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;{{cite web |url=http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/tv/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202172431/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/tv/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&quot;.

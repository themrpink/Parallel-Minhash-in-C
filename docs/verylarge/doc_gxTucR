Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Queens has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a strong [[mayor–council government|mayor–council system]]. The centralized New York City government is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, [[public safety]], recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in Queens. The [[Queens Library]] is governed by a 19-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the [[Mayor of New York City]] and the [[Borough President]] of Queens.

Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough President is [[Melinda Katz]], elected in November 2013 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with 80.3% of the vote. [[Queens Borough Hall]] is the seat of government and is located in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]].

The Democratic Party holds most public offices. Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development. Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and the cost of housing.

Each of the city's five counties has its criminal court system and [[District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. [[Richard Brown (lawyer)|Richard A. Brown]], who ran on both the Republican and Democratic Party tickets, was the [[Queens County District Attorney (New York)|District Attorney of Queens County]] from 1991 to 2018. The new DA as of January 2020 is [[Melinda Katz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensda.org/ |title=Home |website=Queens DA.org |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens has 12 seats on the [[New York City Council]], the second-largest number among the five boroughs. It is divided into 14 community districts, each served by a local [[Community Boards of Queens|Community Board]]. Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for residents.

Although Queens is heavily Democratic, it is considered a swing county in New York politics. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political candidates who do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans such as former Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]] won majorities in Queens. Republican State Senator [[Serphin Maltese]] represented a district in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo. In 2002, Queens voted against incumbent Republican [[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] in favor of his Democratic opponent, [[Carl McCall]] by a slim margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2002/general/2002_gov.pdf|title=2002 Election Results: Governor and Lieutenant Governor|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the national level, Queens has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1972, when Queens voters chose [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. Since the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]], Democratic presidential candidates have received over 70% of the popular vote in Queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2000/wpres2000.pdf|title=2000 Election Results: President and Vice President|publisher=[[New York State Board of Elections]]}}

Queens has the second-largest economy of New York City's five boroughs, following Manhattan. In 2004, Queens had 15.2% (440,310) of all private-sector jobs in New York City and 8.8% of private-sector wages. Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs, with occupations spread relatively evenly across the health care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and [[film production|film]] and [[television production]] sectors, such that no single sector is overwhelmingly dominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;/&gt;

The diversification in Queens' economy is reflected in a large amount of employment in the [[export-oriented economy|export-oriented]] portions of its economy—such as transportation, manufacturing, and business services—that serve customers outside the region. This accounts for more than 27% of all Queens jobs and offers an average salary of $43,727, 14% greater than that of jobs in the locally oriented sector.

The borough's largest employment sector—trade, transportation, and utilities—accounted for nearly 30% of all jobs in 2004. Queens is home to two of the three major New York City area airports, [[JFK International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]]. These airports are among the busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most congested in the country. This airline industry is particularly important to the economy of Queens, providing almost one-quarter of the sector's employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages.

Education and health services are the next largest sector in Queens and comprised almost 24% of the borough's jobs in 2004. The manufacturing and construction industries in Queens are the largest of the city and account for nearly 17% of the borough's private sector jobs. Comprising almost 17% of the jobs in Queens is the information, financial activities, and business and professional services sectors.

{{As of|2003}}, Queens had almost 40,000 business establishments. Small businesses act as an important part of the borough's economic vitality with two-thirds of all businesses employing between one and four people.

Several large companies have their headquarters in Queens, including watchmaker [[Bulova]], based in [[Whitestone, Queens|East Elmhurst]]; internationally renowned piano manufacturer [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] in Astoria; [[Glacéau]], the makers of Vitamin Water, headquartered in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]]; and [[JetBlue Airways]], an airline based in Long Island City.

Long Island City is a major manufacturing and back-office center. [[Whitestone, Queens|Flushing]] is a major commercial hub for [[Chinese American]] and [[Korean American]] businesses, while [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] is the major civic and transportation hub for the borough.

===Roads===

====Highways====
[[File:Air Train JFK Van Wyck jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Air Train JFK]] path above the [[Van Wyck Expressway]]]]
Queens is traversed by three trunk east–west highways. The [[Long Island Expressway]] ([[Interstate 495 (New York)|Interstate 495]]) runs from the [[Queens Midtown Tunnel]] on the west through the borough to Nassau County on the east. The [[Grand Central Parkway]], whose western terminus is the [[Triborough Bridge]], extends east to the Queens/Nassau border, where its name changed to the [[Northern State Parkway]]. The [[Belt Parkway]] begins at the [[Gowanus Expressway]] in Brooklyn, and extends east into Queens, past [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] and JFK Airport. On its eastern end at the Queens/Nassau border, it splits into the [[Southern State Parkway]] which continues east, and the [[Cross Island Parkway (New York)|Cross Island Parkway]] which turns north.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queens,+NY/@40.6511939,-74.0112772,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24369470a592b:0x4109d18b6c5c7b05!8m2!3d40.7282239!4d-73.7948516 |title = Overview Map of Queens|access-date = January 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several major north–south highways in Queens, including the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] ([[Interstate 278]]), the [[Van Wyck Expressway]] ([[Interstate 678]]), the [[Clearview Expressway]] ([[Interstate 295 (New York)|Interstate 295]]), and the Cross Island Parkway.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;

Queens has six state highways that run west–east largely on surface roads. From north to south, they are [[New York State Route 25A]] (Northern Boulevard), [[New York State Route 25B]] (Hillside Avenue), [[New York State Route 25]] ([[Queens Boulevard]], Hillside Avenue, and Braddock Avenue), [[New York State Route 24]] (Hempstead Avenue), and [[New York State Route 27]] ([[Conduit Avenue]]). The only state highway that primarily uses an expressway is [[New York State Route 878]], which uses the Nassau Expressway in southern Queens.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;

====Streets====
[[File:Parsons jewel.jpg|thumb|Standard cross-street signs for a single-named Boulevard and a co-named Avenue, in Queens]]
The streets of Queens are laid out in a semi-[[grid plan|grid]] system, with a numerical system of [[street name]]s (similar to Manhattan and the Bronx). Nearly all roadways oriented north–south are &quot;Streets&quot;, while east–west roadways are &quot;Avenues&quot;, beginning with the number 1 in the west for Streets and the north for Avenues. In some parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often confusing non-residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;SARAH 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Kershaw |title=Meet Me At 60th And 60th; Many Drivers Find Streets of Queens A Confusing Maze |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 15, 2000 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/nyregion/meet-me-at-60th-and-60th-many-drivers-find-streets-of-queens-a-confusing-maze.html | access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, incongruous alignments of street grids, unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street). Numbered roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are not rare. A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as [[New York State Route 25A|Northern Boulevard]], [[Queens Boulevard]], [[Hillside Avenue (Queens)|Hillside Avenue]], and [[Jamaica Avenue (Queens)|Jamaica Avenue]]) carry names rather than numbers, typically though not uniformly called &quot;Boulevards&quot; or &quot;Parkways&quot;.

Queens [[house numbering]] was designed to provide convenience in locating the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern doesn't stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, [[Queens College]] is situated at 65–30 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;SARAH 2000&quot;/&gt;

Many of the village street grids of Queens had only worded names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s, a &quot;Philadelphia Plan&quot; was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. The Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens, worked out the details. Subway stations were only partly renamed, and some, including those along the [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}), now share dual names after the original street names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.junipercivic.com/historyArticle.asp?nid=74#.VHXch8m25KK |title=Bringing Order Out of Chaos in Street Naming and House Numbering |last=Powell |first=Charles U., Engineer in Charge, Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens |date=February 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, some numbered streets in the [[Douglaston Hill Historic District]] were renamed to their original names, with 43rd Avenue becoming Pine Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/nyregion/in-douglaston-queens-turning-away-from-numbered-streets.html?src=recg |title=In Queens, Taking a Step Back From Numbered Streets |first=Sarah Maslin |last=Nir |date=March 26, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County border, and are prefixed with the word &quot;Beach.&quot; Streets at the easternmost end, however, are nearly all named. [[Bayswater, Queens|Bayswater]], which is on Jamaica Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word &quot;Bay&quot; rather than &quot;Beach&quot;. Another deviation from the norm is [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]]; it maintains the north–south numbering progression but uses only the suffix &quot;Road,&quot; as well as the prefixes &quot;West&quot; and &quot;East,&quot; depending on location relative to [[Cross Bay Boulevard (Queens)|Cross Bay Boulevard]], the neighborhood's major through street. Broad Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 1950s; formerly the highest-numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue rather than today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach &amp; Hamilton Beach. The other exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares a grid and [[house numbering]] system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]]. The grid runs east–west from the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] to Flushing Avenue; and north–south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] grid at Broadway. All streets on the grid have names.

====Bridges and tunnels====
{{see also|List of bridges and tunnels in New York City}}
[[File:Hell Gate and Triborough Bridges New York City Queens.jpg|thumb|The [[Triborough Bridge]] connects Queens with Manhattan and the Bronx.]]
Queens is connected to the Bronx by the [[Bronx–Whitestone Bridge]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], the [[Triborough Bridge]] (also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. Queens is connected to Manhattan Island by the Triborough Bridge, the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and the [[Queens–Midtown Tunnel]], as well as to [[Roosevelt Island]] by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]].

While most of the Queens/Brooklyn border is on land, the [[Kosciuszko Bridge]] crosses the [[Newtown Creek]] connecting [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. The [[Pulaski Bridge]] connects [[McGuinness Boulevard]] in Greenpoint to 11th Street, Jackson Avenue, and Hunters Point Avenue in [[Long Island City]]. The J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge (a.k.a. [[Greenpoint Avenue Bridge]]) connects the sections of [[Greenpoint Avenue]] in Greenpoint and Long Island City. A lesser bridge connects [[Grand Street and Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue in Queens to Grand Street in Brooklyn]].

The [[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]], built in 1939, traverses Jamaica Bay to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to [[Broad Channel, Queens|Broad Channel]] and the rest of Queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/crossbay.html |title=Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge |website=[[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]] |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=In 1939 the New York City Parkway Authority built the Cross Bay Bridge and Parkway, along with beach improvements in the Rockaways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed in 1937, the [[Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]] links [[Flatbush Avenue]], Brooklyn's longest thoroughfare, with [[Jacob Riis Park]] and the western end of the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/marine.html |title=Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge |website=MTA Bridges and Tunnels |access-date=July 5, 2016 |quote=The Marine Parkway Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge was opened by the Marine Parkway Authority in 1937 to provide access to the Rockaway Peninsula, which previously could be reached only by ferry or by a circuitous route around the eastern end of Jamaica Bay.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both crossings were built and continue to be operated by what is now known as [[MTA Bridges and Tunnels]]. The [[IND Rockaway Line]] parallels the Cross Bay, has a mid-bay station at [[Broad Channel (IND Rockaway Line)|Broad Channel]] which is just a short walk from the [[Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge]], now part of [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] and a major stop on the [[Atlantic Flyway]].

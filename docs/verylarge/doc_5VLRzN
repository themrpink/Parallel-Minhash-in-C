Downing has been named one of the two most eco-friendly [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/news/0016219-jesus-and-downing-named-greenest-cambridge-colleges.html | title=Jesus and Downing named 'greenest' Cambridge colleges| date=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Upon the death of [[Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet]] in 1749, the wealth left by his grandfather, [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet]], who served both [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and built [[10 Downing Street]] (a door formerly from Number 10 is in use in the college), was applied by his will. Under this will, as he had no direct issue (he was legally separated from his wife), the family fortune was left to his cousin, [[Sir Jacob Downing, 4th Baronet]], and if he died without heir, to three cousins in succession. If they all died without issue, the estates were to be used to found a college at Cambridge called Downing.

Sir Jacob died in 1764, and as the other named heirs had also died, the college should have come into existence then, but Sir Jacob's widow, Margaret, refused to give up the estates and the various relatives who were Sir George's legal heirs had to take costly and prolonged action in the [[Court of Chancery]] to compel her to do so. She died in 1778 but her second husband and the son of her sister continued to resist the heirs-at-law's action until 1800 when the Court decided in favour of Sir George's will and George III granted Downing a Royal Charter, marking the official foundation of the college.

===Buildings===
[[File:Maitland Robinson Library.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Maitland Robinson Library'' by [[Quinlan Terry]], completed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php|title=Quinlan Francis Terry Architects|accessdate=13 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065246/http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php|archive-date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The architect [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] was commissioned by the trustees of the Downing estate, who included the Master of [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], to design the plan for the college. Wilkins, a disciple of the neo-classical architectural style, designed the first wholly campus-based college plan in the world based on a magnificent entrance on [[Downing Street, Cambridge|Downing Street]] reaching back to form the largest court in Cambridge, extending to [[Lensfield Road]]. But this was not to be.

The estate was much reduced by the suit in Chancery, and the grand plans failed. Much of the north side of what was then the Pembroke Leys was sold to the University and is now home to scientific buildings (&quot;The [[Downing Site]]&quot;). In fact, only limited East and West ranges were initially built, with the plans for a library and chapel on the south face of the college shelved.

[[File:Downing College, Cambridge, England - IMG 0610.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Downing College Chapel (behind the portico), built in 1951]]
The third side of the square was only completed in 1951 with the building of the college chapel. Where the fourth side would have been is now a large paddock (known simply as &quot;The Paddock&quot;), with many trees. Though not fully enclosed, the court formed before the Downing College is perhaps largest in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] or [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (a title contested with [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College's]] [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]]). An urban legend amongst Cambridge students claims that [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] pays an undisclosed sum to the college annually with the condition that it will never build the fourth side of the square, so that Trinity may maintain the distinction of having the largest enclosed court of all colleges of Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The most recent building additions are the Howard Lodge accommodation, the Howard Building, and most recent of all the Howard Theatre which opened in 2010. These were sponsored by the [[Howard Foundation (UK)|Howard Foundation]] and are located behind the main court around their own small garden. These facilities are used for conference and businesses gatherings outside the student term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downing-conferences-cambridge.co.uk/ |title=Downing College Conferences &amp; Functions, Cambridge |publisher=Downing-conferences-cambridge.co.uk |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heong Gallery ===

The Heong Gallery, opened in February 2016, is a modern and contemporary art gallery at Downing.  It is named for Alwyn Heong, an alumnus of the college, who is a supporter of the visual arts. The conversion of a stables building by [[Caruso St John]] won a RIBA regional award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heong Gallery, Downing College|url=https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-regional-awards/riba-east-award-winners/2017/heong-gallery-downing-college|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

Downing students remain prominent in the University world; in the past few years [[Cambridge Union]] Presidents, Blues captains, Law and Economic Society Presidents and more have hailed from the college. Downing has a particular reputation for law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downingcambridge.com/previous_campaigns-hopkins_parry_appeal|title=Previous Campaigns – the Hopkins Parry Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Griffin'' has been the undergraduate student magazine for over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://griffin.downingjcr.co.uk/|title=The Griffin|author=FaceJolt|accessdate=13 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011082934/http://griffin.downingjcr.co.uk/|archive-date=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Downing College Boathouse - geograph.org.uk - 1633217.jpg|thumb|Downing College boathouse on the River Cam, it was rebuilt in 2000. Here a trailer of rowing boats is shown outside the building.]]

===Sport===

The college fields teams in a range of sports including, men's football, men's and women's rugby, tennis and [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]].

[[Downing College Boat Club]] is successful too, with the Women's first boat gaining [[Lent Bumps|Lents Headship]] of the river in 2004 and most recently in [[Lent Bumps 2020|2020]], and the Mays Headship in the 2014 and 2015 [[May Bumps]].  The men's first boat has held the headship several times in the 1980s and 1990s (for example in 1994 to 1996) while gaining the Mays headship in 1996
and the Lents Headship in 2014, on each occasion recognising the tradition of &quot;burning the boat&quot; (using an old wooden 8 oared boat), while the rowers of the winning boat jump the flames. They both currently hold positions at or near the top in both University bumps races [Lents and Mays].

The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country. As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954|title=Preliminary population 2018|date=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190516/http://vrk.fi/default.aspx?docid=8639&amp;site=3&amp;id=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of Finnish municipalities by population|sixth largest]] city in Finland after [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Tampere]], [[Vantaa]] and [[Oulu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;population_count&quot;/&gt; There were 330,192&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vamuu/statfin_vamuu_pxt_001.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=be87bf03-2bee-49e1-8a2f-ad390937d954|title=Turku sub-regional unit, Preliminary population by Month|date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants living in the [[Turku sub-region]], ranking it as the [[List of urban areas in Finland by population|third largest]] urban area in Finland after the [[Greater Helsinki]] area and [[Tampere sub-region]].

It is unknown when Turku gained [[city right]]s. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city. As the oldest town in the country, Turku was the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the [[Finnish war]], Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the [[Russian Empire]] (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was moved to Helsinki (1812).

It was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the [[Royal Academy of Turku]] (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki. Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.

Because of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced [[History of Finland|Finnish history]]. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital. Along with [[Tallinn]], the capital city of [[Estonia]], Turku was designated the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |title=Christmas City » Turku, the Finnish Christmas City |publisher=www.turku.fi |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095158/https://www.turku.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=9289&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Turku has been officially declared the &quot;Food Capital of Finland&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefoodellers.com/en/turku-finland-city-guide Turku, The Food Capital Of Finland – The Foodellers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.utu.fi/bre/finlands-former-capital-turku-is-now-the-culinary-capital/ Finland’s former capital Turku is now the culinary capital – University of Turku]&lt;/ref&gt; because it holds a number of Finland’s oldest and high-qualited restaurants, including the country’s top-rated [[Indian restaurant]] Delhi Darbar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lonelyplanet.com/finland/south-coast/turku/restaurants/delhi-darbar/a/poi-eat/1499802/359205 Delhi Darbar, Indian in Turku – Lonely Planet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a historically famous [[fish market]] held twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theculturetrip.com/europe/finland/articles/11-places-finland-perfect-food-lovers/%3famp=1 The Culture Trip: 11 Places in Finland Perfect for Food Lovers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger [[seaport]] with over three million passengers traveling through the [[Port of Turku]] each year to [[Stockholm]] and [[Mariehamn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;turku_stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Statistical yearbook of Turku | url = http://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 | date = 2008-07-17 | language = fi | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175319/https://www.turku.fi/Public/default.aspx?nodeid=3981&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 | archive-date = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Names and etymology}}Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Turku in different languages}}
The Finnish name ''Turku'' originates from an [[Old East Slavic]] word, ''[[wikt:търгъ#Old East Slavic|tǔrgǔ]]'', meaning &quot;[[market place]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html |title=Keskiaika - Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla |publisher=Katajala.net |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:turku#Finnish|turku]]'' still means &quot;market place&quot; in some Finnish dialects.

The Swedish name ''Åbo'' may be a simple combination of ''å'' (&quot;river; creek; large stream&quot;) and ''bo'' (&quot;dwelling&quot;). There is however an old legal term called &quot;{{illm|åborätt|sv|åborätt}}&quot; (meaning roughly &quot;right to live at&quot;), which gave citizens (called &quot;åbo&quot;) the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (''å'' meant ''at'' or ''on'' in old Swedish, now ''på'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Åborätt]]{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the [[Finnish noun cases|genitive]] of ''Turku'' is '''''Turun''''', meaning &quot;of Turku&quot;. The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in ''Turun yliopisto'' for the [[University of Turku]].

==History==
Turku has a long history as [[Finland]]'s largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by [[Helsinki]]. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/W5/index.nsf/(pages)/Destinations |title=Destinations in Finland - Official Travel and Tourism Guide |publisher=Visitfinland.com |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country's first capital. Originally, the word &quot;Finland&quot; referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, &quot;[[Finland Proper]]&quot; for the region).

Although archaeological findings in the area date back to the [[Stone Age]] and early literary sources such as [[Al-Idrisi]]'s world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html|title= Varhainen Turku rakennettiin pellolle|accessdate= 2008-05-06|author= Aki Pihlman|date= 2006-09-13|language= fi|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090113003534/https://www.utu.fi/media/ajankohtaista/argumentit/AkiPihlman.html|archive-date= 2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turku Cathedral]] was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1300.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spicer2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Spicer|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyErqszUsFYC&amp;pg=PA314|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6583-0|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Turku was the seat of the [[Bishop of Turku]] (a title later upgraded to [[Archdiocese of Turku|Archbishop of Turku]]), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of [[Duke of Finland|Dukes]] and [[Governor-General in the Swedish Realm|Governors-General of Finland]] usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the [[War against Sigismund]], the town was the site of the [[Åbo Bloodbath]]. In 1640, the first [[university]] in Finland, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the [[States of Finland]] in 1676.

After the [[Finnish War]], which ended when [[Sweden]] ceded Finland to [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] at the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as [[Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the [[Great Fire of Turku]], which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.

[[File:Aurakatu 1910's.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Aurakatu area in the 1910s]]

In 1918, a new university, the [[Åbo Akademi]] – the only [[Swedish language]] university in Finland – was founded in Turku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About Åbo Akademi University|url=https://www.abo.fi/en/about-abo-akademi-university/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=Åbo Akademi University|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Finnish language]] [[University of Turku]] was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.

In the 20th century, Turku was called &quot;Finland's gateway to the West&quot; by historians such as [[Jarmo Virmavirta]]. The city enjoyed good connections with other [[Western Europe]]an countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with [[Stockholm]] across the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a [[town twinning|twinning]] agreement with [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] in the [[Soviet Union]], leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]], many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them [[Vladimir Putin]], then Leningrad's deputy [[mayor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945 {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the [[Market Square, Turku|Market Square]] was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.

[[File:Aura River Turku.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Aura River (Finland)|Aura River]] seen further away from central Turku]]
Located at the mouth of the [[Aura River (Finland)|Aura river]] in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of {{convert|245|km2}} of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as ''täl pual jokke'' (&quot;this side of the river&quot;), while the western side is referred to as ''tois pual jokke'' (&quot;the other side of the river&quot;). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is ''Auransilta'', which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is ''Kirjastosilta'' ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&amp;nodeid=23 |title=Kirjastosilta avattiin tulen ja valon juhlassa |publisher=www.turku.fi |accessdate=2014-01-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114100705/https://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&amp;nodeid=23 |archive-date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Föri]]'', a small [[ferry]] that transports pedestrians and [[bicycle]]s across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.

With a population of approximately 300,000{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, the [[Turku sub-region|Turku Region]] ([[Local administrative unit|LAU]]&amp;nbsp;1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after [[Greater Helsinki]] and the area around [[Tampere]]. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: [[Askainen]], [[Kaarina]], [[Lemu]], [[Lieto]], [[Masku]], [[Merimasku]], [[Mynämäki]], [[Naantali]], [[Nousiainen]], [[Paimio]], [[Piikkiö]], [[Raisio]], [[Rusko]], [[Rymättylä]], [[Sauvo]], [[Vahto]], and [[Velkua]].

A more exclusive definition for the urban area is the [[Turku sub-region|city region of Turku]] with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.

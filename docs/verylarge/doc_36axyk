In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965), Paul is fifteen years old; the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] orders the family to leave Caladan and govern the desert planet [[Arrakis]] (known as Dune), though Paul's father Duke Leto is in full knowledge that the Emperor is colluding with [[House Harkonnen]] to destroy the Atreides as a perceived threat to the throne. On Dune, the family is betrayed by their [[Suk School|Suk doctor]], [[Wellington Yueh]]. He disables the House defensive shields, allowing the Imperial [[Sardaukar]] troops, dressed in Harkonnen uniforms, to capture Duke Leto and Hawat and to kill most of the Atreides army. Duncan sacrifices himself while attempting to hold off the Sardaukar and ensures Paul's escape. His betrayal motivated by the Baron's capture and torture of his Bene Gesserit wife, Yueh implants a poisonous gas capsule concealed within a false tooth on Duke Leto after his capture and instructs Leto to use it to kill the Baron. Shortly afterward, the Baron has Yueh murdered. Upon meeting Baron Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat [[Piter De Vries]], Leto bites down on the capsule. He succeeds in killing De Vries — and himself — but not the Baron. Fed a poison for which only the Baron has the antidote, Hawat is forced to serve as the new Harkonnen Mentat. With some help from Yueh, Paul and Jessica escape into the desert.

They flee to the [[Fremen]], who see in Paul the ''Lisan al-Gaib'' or &quot;the Voice from the Outer World&quot;, a [[prophet]] they call the [[Mahdi (Dune)|Mahdi]] whom they believe is &quot;The One Who Will Lead Us to Paradise&quot;. Paul and Jessica take shelter in [[Sietch Tabr]], a Fremen settlement led by the [[naib (Dune)|naib]], [[Stilgar]]. Paul and his mother train the Fremen in weapon use and martial arts, creating a formidable army. When Paul is accepted into the Fremen tribe, he is given the secret &quot;sietch name&quot; [[Usul (Dune)|Usul]], the Fremen word meaning &quot;the base of the pillar&quot;. He chooses &quot;Paul Muad'Dib&quot; as his common name of manhood, to be used openly. Muad'Dib is the name of the adapted [[kangaroo mouse]] of Arrakis, and Stilgar relates that Paul's choice pleases the Fremen:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.'  That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;&gt;[[Frank Herbert|Herbert, Frank]] (1965). ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. {{ISBN|0-441-17271-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Paul leads a Fremen campaign of resistance against Harkonnen rule. He and [[Chani (character)|Chani]], daughter of [[Liet-Kynes]], take each other as mates and produce a son, named ''Leto'' in honor of Paul's father. Paul also reunites with Gurney Halleck, who  had sought refuge with smugglers after the Harkonnen attack. In a bid to unlock his latent powers, Paul undergoes the process of [[spice agony]] via the consumption of the [[Water of Life (Dune)|Water of Life]]. He survives, although barely, and the ordeal gives him knowledge of his male and female [[ancestor]]s; this proves Paul is the [[Kwisatz Haderach]].

Awakening, Paul launches an attack on the Harkonnen and Imperial troops with his Fremen army (and with his personal bodyguard, the [[Fedaykin]]), riding the enormous [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] indigenous to the planet. In the attack, he learns that his son Leto has been killed in a Sardaukar raid. They win and Paul requests an audience with Shaddam IV. He threatens to destroy the spice [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], thus making transport between the planets impossible and effectively destroying civilization. In return for preserving the spice, he requires the hand of the Emperor's daughter, the Bene Gesserit-trained [[Princess Irulan]] as well as the Emperor's abdication in favor of Paul. Urged by the [[Spacing Guild]], Shaddam accepts his terms.

===''Dune Messiah''===
In ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), Paul has been Emperor for twelve years. His [[jihad]] has killed sixty billion people across the known universe, but according to his [[prescience|prescient vision]], this is a fate far better than what he has seen. Paul is beleaguered by a need he ''sees'' — to set humanity on a course that does not lead to stagnation and destruction, while at the same time managing both the Empire and the religion built around him.

A Fremen conspiracy attempts to assassinate Paul using a [[stone burner]]. The attempt fails, but the effects of the weapon destroy Paul's eyes. Although he becomes physically blind, his prescience allows him to &quot;see&quot; by tightly locking in reality with his prescient visions.  Afflicted by despair as a result of his prescience, Paul faces another assassination attempt by a conspiracy of the [[Bene Tleilax]], the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. This attempt, made using a [[ghola]] (a resurrected clone) of Paul's friend and mentor Duncan Idaho also fails, but the ordeal seemingly helps the Duncan ghola to regain his memories. At the same time, Chani dies in childbirth, bearing twins: a boy, [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]], and a girl, [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] (which means &quot;spoil of war&quot;). Paul, who did not foresee the birth of twins, loses his prescience after Chani's death and becomes truly blind, although he conceals this. With a knife over the babies, the Tleilaxu [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]] offers to make a ghola of Chani and restore her to life, in exchange for all of Paul's [[CHOAM]] holdings and his effective abdication from the throne. However Paul, seeing through his newborn son's eyes, kills Scytale. Immediately afterwards, the dwarf Tleilaxu Master [[Bijaz]] makes the same offer regarding the Chani ghola; Paul orders Duncan to kill Bijaz. The blind Paul then walks into the desert to die alone, in accordance with Fremen law. He leaves his children in the care of the Fremen, with Paul's sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] set to rule the empire as regent.

===''Children of Dune''===
In ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976) a mysterious figure known as '''The Preacher''' emerges from the desert and preaches among the people of Arrakis. Led around by a boy, he discredits the religion that has been built around Paul Atreides, saying &quot;The religion of Muad'Dib is not Muad'Dib&quot;, and scorns Alia. It is strongly suggested that he is indeed Paul, which is confirmed when he walks past Alia and says, &quot;Stop trying to pull me into the background once more, sister.&quot; Paul meets with his son Leto in the desert. They have both seen mankind's future extinction in their prescient vision; Paul had been unable to face the terrible sacrifice necessary to avoid this future, and hopes Leto will enjoy his life rather than take that path. Leto has decided otherwise, and soon begins the long transformation into a sandworm. Back in [[Arrakeen]], Paul (as the Preacher) speaks out against Alia to the crowd outside Alia's Temple; his words and the actions of Leto cause a riot. Reacting to his blasphemy, Alia's priests rush forward and stab Paul to death, as Alia and the remaining Atreides watch from above.

Over 3,500 years later in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), Leto still rules the universe as the Tyrant. The ego-personas of Paul and Leto's other ancestors &quot;live&quot; within his [[Other Memory]].

At the end of Frank Herbert's sixth and last book in the ''Dune'' series, ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'' (1985), a ghola of Scytale is seemingly the only Tleilaxu Master left alive. He secretly possesses a [[nullentropy]] capsule containing cells carefully and secretly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including cells from Paul himself.

In [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]'s ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'', the 2006 sequel to ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', Scytale is a prisoner on the [[no-ship]] ''[[Ithaca (Dune)|Ithaca]]'', at the mercy of the latest Duncan Idaho ghola and a rebel group of Bene Gesserit. Nearing death from advanced age, a desperate Scytale trades his precious cell samples for permission to grow his own ghola; Duncan and the Bene Gesserit group subsequently grow gholas of Paul, Chani, Jessica, and others. Meanwhile, the independent Face Dancer [[Khrone]] obtains Paul's genetic material from a religious relic on Caladan and tasks his [[Lost Tleilaxu]] prisoner [[Uxtal]] to create his own ghola of Paul. Named '''Paolo''', this ghola is to be &quot;conditioned&quot; by Khrone's sadistic ghola of Baron Harkonnen to become a twisted version of Paul, who will serve the shadowy needs of Krone's mysterious masters, [[Daniel and Marty]].

In 2007's ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'', the young Paul ghola ultimately duels Paolo. Paul is mortally wounded, but the trauma restores his original memories and he manages to heal himself. A power-hungry Paolo overdoses on [[ultraspice]], an incredibly potent form of melange, and falls into a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state. Later on the recovering planet Dune, the awakened gholas of Paul and Chani have reverted to the ways of the ancient Fremen, resolving to lead simple lives and restore the planet to its former glory. Paul reaffirms his love for Chani, telling her he has loved her for five thousand years.

Paul's birth is featured in the Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson [[prequel]] novel ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'' (2001). The 2008 novel ''[[Paul of Dune]]'' explores both Paul's childhood before ''Dune'' and his life between the novels ''Dune'' and ''Dune Messiah''. Brian Herbert and Anderson's ''[[The Winds of Dune]]'' (2009) also relates events from Paul's youth and the period before ''Dune Messiah''.

==Paul as hero==
According to novelist [[Brian Herbert]], Frank Herbert's son and biographer, House Atreides was based on the heroic but ill-fated Greek mythological House [[Atreus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune Afterword&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert |year=1965 |edition=Kindle |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |pages=875–877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the characters in ''Dune'' fit mythological archetypes, Brian Herbert wrote that &quot;Paul is the hero prince on a quest who weds the daughter of a 'king'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune Afterword&quot;/&gt; A primary theme of ''Dune'' and its sequels is Frank Herbert's warning about society's tendencies to &quot;give over every decision-making capacity&quot; to a charismatic leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Touponce 12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Touponce |first=William F. |year=1988 |title=Frank Herbert |chapter=''Dune'': Herbert's Polyphonic Novel |location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall &amp; Co|page=12 |isbn=0-8057-7514-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 1979, &quot;The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clareson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clareson |first=Thomas |title=Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: the Formative Period |location=Columbia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=1992 |pages=169–172 |isbn=0-87249-870-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1985, &quot;''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]] |chapter=Introduction |year=1985 |isbn=0-425-08398-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1970 interview, Herbert noted that the character of Paul was constructed to express &quot;the conflict between absolutes and the necessity of the moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinanvural.com/seksek/inien/tvd/tvd2.htm|title=Interview with Frank Herbert|last=McNelly|first=Willis|year=1970|accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Herbert wrote:
{{quote|Paul Atreides (who is the messianic &quot;Muad'Dib&quot; to the Fremen) resembles Lawrence of Arabia ([[T. E. Lawrence]]), a British citizen who led Arab forces in a successful desert revolt against the Turks during [[World War I]]. Lawrence employed guerrilla tactics to destroy enemy forces and communication lines, and came close to becoming a messiah figure for the Arabs. This historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the possibility of an outsider leading native forces against the morally corrupt occupiers of a desert world, in the process becoming a godlike figure to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune Afterword&quot; /&gt;}}

Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many [[monomyth|stories describing the birth of a hero]]. He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him, and after a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tilley |first=E.

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as [[Superman]], [[A. E. van Vogt|van Vogt]]'s [[Gilbert Gosseyn]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of &quot;painful and slow personal progress&quot;. And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through &quot;the application of mystical philosophies and techniques&quot;. For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit and Mentats).&lt;ref name=&quot;prieto&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prieto-Pablos |first=Juan A. |title=The Ambivalent Hero of Contemporary Fantasy and Science Fiction |journal=[[Extrapolation (journal)|Extrapolation]] |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=64–80 |publisher=The University of Texas at Brownsville |date=Spring 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Villeneuve]], director and co-writer of the 2021 film adaptation ''[[Dune (2021 film)|Dune]]'', compared Paul to the character [[Michael Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'', explaining that &quot;He's training to be the Duke. But as much as he's been prepared and trained for that role, is it really what he dreams to be? That's the contradiction of that character. It's like Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather''–it's someone that has a very tragic fate and he will become something that he was not wishing to become.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-compares-paul-atreides-to-michael-corleone-exclusive-image/|title=''Dune'': Denis Villeneuve Compares Paul Atreides to ''The Godfather''{{'s}} Michael Corleone|date=May 15, 2020|website=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|first=Ben|last=Travis|accessdate=May 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian-Canadian commentator Khalid M. Baheyeldin has enumerated the obviously Islamic concepts and references appearing in ''Dune'', to the level of finding multiple similarities between the career of Herbert's Paul Atreides and that of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Beyond the obvious general resemblance  - both Muhammad and Atreides found a powerful new religion, energizing hitherto disregarded desert-dwellers to topple an old empire and build a new one - Baheyeldin noted various specific similarities between Muhammad's career and that of Atreides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bahayeldin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baheyeldin.com/literature/arabic-and-islamic-themes-in-frank-herberts-dune.html |title=Arabic and Islamic themes in Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' |last=Bahayeldin |first=Khalid |date=January 22, 2004 |accessdate=July 21, 2009 |publisher=Baheyeldin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crisis of the Third Century''', also known as '''Military Anarchy''' or the '''Imperial Crisis''' (235–284 AD), was a period in which the [[Roman Empire]] nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of [[barbarian]] [[invasion]]s and [[Human migration|migration]]s into the Roman territory, [[civil war]]s, [[bagaudae|peasant rebellions]], [[political instability]] (with multiple [[Roman usurper|usurpers]] competing for power), Roman reliance on (and growing influence of) barbarian mercenaries known as [[foederati]] and commanders nominally working for Rome (but increasingly independent), [[Plague of Cyprian|plague]], [[debasement]] of [[Roman currency|currency]], and [[economic collapse|economic depression]].

The crisis began with the [[assassination]] of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]] by his own troops in 235. This initiated a 50-year period during which there were at least 26 claimants to the title of emperor, mostly prominent [[Roman army]] [[general]]s, who assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire. The same number of men became accepted by the [[Roman Senate]] as emperor during this period and so became legitimate emperors.

By 268, the empire had split into three competing states: the [[Gallic Empire]] (including the [[Roman province]]s of [[Gaul]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and, briefly, [[Hispania]]); the [[Palmyrene Empire]] (including the eastern provinces of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria Palaestina]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Aegyptus]]); and, between them, the Italian-centered independent Roman Empire proper. Later, [[Aurelian]] (270–275) reunited the empire. The crisis ended with the ascension of [[Diocletian]] and his implementation of reforms in 284.

The crisis resulted in such profound changes in the empire's institutions, society, economic life, and [[religion in Ancient Rome|religion]] that it is increasingly seen by most historians as defining the transition between the [[periodization|historical periods]] of [[classical antiquity]] and [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Brown|first= Peter Robert Lamont|title = The World of Late Antiquity|location= London|year= 1971|page= 22|publisher = Thames and Hudson|isbn = 978-0500320228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Roman Empire had been stabilized, once again, after the turmoil of the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] (193) in the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], the later [[Severan dynasty]] lost more and more control.

Instead of warring in foreign lands, the Roman empire was increasingly put on the defensive from marauding enemies and civil wars. This cut off the essential source of income gained from plundering enemy countries, while opening up the Roman countryside to economic devastation from both enemy and Roman looting. Frequent civil wars contributed to depletion of the army's manpower, and drafting replacement soldiers strained the labour force further. Fighting on multiple fronts, increasing size and pay of the army, increasing cost of transport, populist &quot;bread and circuses&quot; political campaigns, inefficient and corrupt tax collection, unorganised budgeting, and paying off foreign nations for peace all contributed to financial crisis. The emperors responded by confiscating assets and supplies to fund the deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alaric Watson |title=Aurelian and the Third Century |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1134908156 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of the Roman Empire became dire in 235. Many [[Roman legion]]s had been defeated during a previous campaign against [[Germanic peoples]] raiding across the borders, while the emperor [[Severus Alexander]] had been focused primarily on the dangers from the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Leading his troops personally, the emperor resorted to diplomacy and accepting tribute to pacify the [[Germanic chieftain]]s quickly, rather than military conquest. According to [[Herodian]] this cost Severus Alexander the respect of his troops, who may have felt that more severe punishment was required for the tribes that had intruded on Rome's territory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; Herodian says &quot;in their opinion, Alexander showed no honourable intention to pursue the war and preferred a life of ease, when he should have marched out to punish the Germans for their previous insolence&quot; (Herodian vi.7.10).&lt;/ref&gt; The troops assassinated Severus Alexander and proclaimed the new emperor to be [[Maximinus Thrax]], commander of one of the legions present.

Maximinus was the first of the [[barracks emperor]]s – rulers who were elevated by the troops without having any political experience, a supporting faction, distinguished ancestors, or a hereditary claim to the imperial throne. As their rule rested on military might and generalship, they operated as [[warlord]]s reliant on the army to maintain power. Maximinus continued the campaigns in [[Germania]] but struggled to exert his authority over the whole empire. The Senate was displeased at having to accept a peasant as Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'', Routledge, 2001, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; This precipitated the chaotic [[Year of the Six Emperors]] during which all of the original claimants were killed: in 238 a revolt broke out in Africa led by Gordian I and Gordian II,&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'', Routledge, 2001, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; which was soon supported by the [[Roman Senate]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras]], Compendium of History [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521191250/http://www.ancientsites.com/aw/Post/1049415 extract: ''Zonaras: Alexander Severus to Diocletian: 222–284''] 12:16&lt;/ref&gt; but this was quickly defeated with Gordian II killed and Gordian I committing suicide. The Senate, fearing Imperial wrath,&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'', Routledge, 2001, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; raised two of their own as co-Emperors, Pupienus and Balbinus with Gordian I's grandson Gordian III as ''Caesar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/maxthrax.htm Meckler, Michael L., ''Maximinus Thrax (235–238 A.D.)'', ''De Imperatoribus Romanis''] (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Maximinus marched on Rome but was assassinated by his [[Legio II Parthica]], and subsequently Pupienus and Balbinus were murdered by the [[Praetorian Guard]].

In the following years, numerous generals of the Roman army fought each other for control of the empire and neglected their duties of defending it from invasion. There were frequent raids across the [[Limes Germanicus|Rhine and Danube frontier]] by foreign tribes, including the [[Carpians]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], and [[Alamanni]], and attacks from [[Sassanids]] in the east. [[Climate change (general concept)|Climate changes]] and a [[sea level rise]] disrupted the agriculture of what is now the [[Low Countries]], forcing tribes residing in the region to migrate into Roman lands.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat (2011-02-17). &quot;Third Century Crisis of the Roman Empire&quot;.

Throughout the period, numerous [[usurper]]s claimed the imperial throne. In the absence of a strong central authority, the empire broke into three competing states. The [[Roman province]]s of [[Gaul]], [[Roman Britain|Britain]], and [[Hispania]] broke off to form the [[Gallic Empire]] in 260. The eastern provinces of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Aegyptus]] also became independent as the [[Palmyrene Empire]] in 267. The remaining provinces, centered on Italy, stayed under a single ruler but now faced threats on every side.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Gothic raids in the 3rd century.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Goths|Gothic]] raids in the 3rd century]]
An invasion of Macedonia and Greece by [[Goths]], who had been displaced from their lands on the [[Black Sea]], was defeated by emperor [[Claudius II|Claudius II Gothicus]] at the [[Battle of Naissus]] in 268 or 269. Historians see this victory as the turning point of the crisis. In its aftermath, a series of tough, energetic barracks emperors were able to reassert central authority. Further victories by Claudius Gothicus drove back the [[Alamanni]] and recovered Hispania from the Gallic Empire. He died of the plague in 270 and was succeeded by [[Aurelian]], who had commanded the cavalry at Naissus. Aurelian reigned (270–275) through the worst of the crisis, gradually restoring the empire. He defeated the Vandals, [[Visigoths]], Palmyrene Empire, and finally the remainder of the Gallic Empire. By late 274, the Roman Empire had been reunited into a single entity. However, Aurelian was assassinated in 275, sparking a further series of competing emperors with short reigns. The situation didn't stabilize until [[Diocletian]], himself a barracks emperor, took power in 284.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

More than a century would pass before Rome again lost military ascendancy over its external enemies. However, dozens of formerly thriving cities, especially in the Western Empire, had been ruined. Their populations dead or dispersed, these cities could not be rebuilt, due to the economic breakdown caused by constant warfare. The economy had been ruined by the breakdown in trading networks and the debasement of the currency. Major cities and towns, including Rome itself, had not needed fortifications for many centuries, but now surrounded themselves with thick [[Defensive wall|walls]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Fundamental problems with the empire still remained. The right of imperial succession had never been clearly defined, which was a factor in the continuous civil wars as competing factions in the military, Senate, and other parties put forward their favored candidate for emperor. The sheer size of the empire, which had been an issue since the late [[Roman Republic]] three centuries earlier, continued to make it difficult for a single ruler to effectively counter multiple threats at the same time. These continuing problems were addressed by the radical reforms of Diocletian, who broke the cycle of usurpation. He began by sharing his rule with a colleague, then formally established the [[Tetrarchy]] of four co-emperors in 293.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, Frank (1987). Diocletian und die Erste Tetrarchie. Improvisation oder Experiment in der Organisation monarchischer Herrschaft?, Berlin: de Gruyter. {{ISBN|978-3-11-010934-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians regard this as the end of the crisis period, which had lasted 58 years.  However the trend of civil war would continue after the abdication of Diocletian in the [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy]] (306-324) until the rise of [[Constantine the Great]] as sole Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, Ramsay. Constantine. New York: Dial Press, 1969. {{ISBN|0-7099-4685-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire survived [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|until 476 in the West]] and [[Decline of the Byzantine Empire|until 1453 in the East]].

== Causes ==

=== The problem of succession and civil war ===
From the beginning of the [[Principate]] there were no clear rules for the imperial succession, largely because the empire maintained the facade of a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armstrong.edu/history-journal/history-journal-res-publica-restituta-republic-and-princeps-in-the-early-ro|title=Res Publica Restituta? Republic and Princeps in the Early Roman Empire – Armstrong Undergraduate Journal of History|website=www.armstrong.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early Principate, the process for becoming an emperor relied on a combination of proclamation by the Senate, popular approval, and acceptance by the army, in particular the [[Praetorian Guard]]. A family connection to a previous emperor was beneficial, but it did not determine the issue in the way a formal system of [[hereditary succession]] would. From the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] onwards was sometimes tension between the Senate's preferred choice and the army. As the Senatorial class declined in political influence and more generals were recruited from the provinces this tension increased. 

Whenever the succession appeared uncertain, there was an incentive for any general with support of a sizable army to attempt to seize power, sparking civil war. The most recent example of this prior to the Crisis was the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] which resulted in the victory of [[Septimius Severus]]. After the overthrow of the Severan dynasty, for the rest of the 3rd Century, Rome was ruled by a series of generals, coming into power through frequent civil wars which devastated the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-210/lecture-2|title=The Crisis of the Third Century and the Diocletianic Reforms|last=Freedman|first=Paul|date=Fall 2011|website=Yale University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208024717/http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-210/lecture-2#|archivedate=2017-12-08|url-status=live|accessdate=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural disasters ===
The first and most immediately disastrous of the natural disasters that the Roman Empire faced during the Third Century was the plague. The [[Antonine Plague]] that preceded the Crisis of the Third Century sapped manpower from Roman armies and proved disastrous for the Roman economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sabbatani|first1=S.|last2=Fiorino|first2=S.|date=December 2009|url=|title=The Antonine Plague and the decline of the Roman Empire|journal=Le Infezioni in Medicina: Rivista Periodica di Eziologia, Epidemiologia, Diagnostica, Clinica e Terapia delle Patologie Infettive|volume=17|issue=4|pages= 261–275 |issn=1124-9390|pmid=20046111}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 249 AD to 262 AD, the [[Plague of Cyprian]] devastated the Roman Empire so much so that some cities, such as the [[Alexandria|city of Alexandria]], experienced a 62% decline in population. These plagues greatly hindered the Roman Empire's ability to ward off barbarian invasions but also factored into problems such as [[famine]], with many farms becoming abandoned and unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/solving-the-mystery-of-an-ancient-roman-plague/543528/ |title=Solving the Mystery of an Ancient Roman Plague|last=Harper |first=Kyle|date=2017-11-01|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121010741/https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/solving-the-mystery-of-an-ancient-roman-plague/543528/#|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second and longer-term natural disaster that took place during the Third Century was the increased variability of weather. Drier summers meant less [[agricultural productivity]] and more extreme weather events led to agricultural instability. This could also have contributed to the increased barbarian pressure on Roman borders, as they too would have experienced the detrimental effects of climate change and sought to push inward to more productive regions of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/was-the-roman-empire-a-victim-of-climate-change/6724/|title=Was the Roman Empire a victim of climate change? |work= Need to Know|publisher= PBS|language=en-US|access-date=|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181020224030/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/was-the-roman-empire-a-victim-of-climate-change/6724/#|archive-date=2018-10-20|url-status=live|first = John A.|last = Light|date = 26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign invasions ===

[[File:Barbarian invasions from 3rd century.png|thumb|270px|Barbarian invasions against the Roman Empire in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century]] 
Barbarian invasions came in the wake of civil war, plague, and famine.  Distress caused in part by the changing climate led various barbarian tribes to push into Roman territory.  Other tribes coalesced into more formidable entities (notably the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]] and [[Franks]]), or were pushed out of their former territories by more dangerous peoples such as the [[Sarmatians]] (the [[Huns]] did not appear west of the Volga for another century).  Eventually, the frontiers were stabilized by the [[Illyrian emperors|Illyrian Emperors]]. However, barbarian migrations into the empire continued in greater and greater numbers. Though these migrants were initially  closely monitored and assimilated, later tribes eventually entered the Roman Empire ''en masse'' with their weapons, giving only token recognition of Roman authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roman Empire|last=Nigel.|first=Rodgers|date=2006|publisher=Lorenz Books|others=Dodge, Hazel.|isbn=978-0754816027|location=London|oclc=62177842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defensive battles that Rome had to endure on the Danube since the 230s, however, paled in comparison to the threat the empire faced in the East. There, [[Sassanid Persia]] represented a far greater danger to Rome than the isolated attacks of [[Germanic tribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Wiesehöfer: Das Reich der Sāsāniden, in Klaus Peter Johne, Udo Hartmann, Thomas Gerhardt, Die Zeit der Soldatenkaiser: Krise und Transformation des Römischen Reiches im 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. (235–284) 2008, p. 531ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanids had in 224 and 226 overthrown the Parthian Arsacids, and the Persian King Ardashir I, who also wanted to prove his legitimacy through military successes, had already penetrated into Roman territory at the time of Severus Alexander, probably taking the strategically important cities of Nisibis and Carrhae.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Kettenhofen: Die Eroberung von Nisibis und Karrhai durch die Sāsāniden in der Zeit Kaiser Maximins, 235/236 AD.

As each of the short-lived emperors took power, they needed ways to raise money quickly to pay the military's &quot;accession bonus&quot; and the easiest way to do so was by inflating the coinage severely, a process made possible by debasing the coinage with bronze and copper.

This resulted in runaway rises in prices, and by the time Diocletian came to power, the old coinage of the Roman Empire had nearly collapsed. Some taxes were collected in kind and values often were notional, in [[bullion]] or [[bronze]] coinage. [[Real versus nominal value|Real values]] continued to be figured in gold coinage, but the silver coin, the denarius, used for 300 years, was gone (1 pound of gold = 40 gold [[aureus|aurei]] = 1,000 [[denarius|denarii]] = 4,000 [[sestertius|sestertii]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} This currency had almost no value by the end of the third century, and trade was carried out without retail coinage.

=== Breakdown of internal trade network ===
One of the most profound and lasting effects of the Crisis of the Third Century was the disruption of Rome's extensive internal trade network. Ever since the [[Pax Romana]], starting with [[Augustus]], the empire's economy had depended in large part on trade between Mediterranean ports and across the extensive road systems to the Empire's interior. Merchants could travel from one end of the empire to the other in relative safety within a few weeks, moving agricultural goods produced in the provinces to the cities, and manufactured goods produced by the great cities of the East to the more rural provinces.

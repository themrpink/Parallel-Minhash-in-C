In this work, [[Action (physics)|action]] becomes a sort of opposite to [[entropy]], through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;{\text{action}\over h} = -{\text{entropy}\over k}&lt;/math&gt;
As a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the [[uncertainty principle]] to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to ''reductions in entropy''.

{{essay|WP:NEWLINE}}

If you add two [[newline|line breaks]] (by pressing return twice) to the source text, Wikipedia will create a new paragraph. It is uncontroversial that paragraphs should be used to make articles easy to read. This page, however, refers to single line breaks within article source texts. 

Single line breaks in the source text are not translated to single line breaks in the output (if you ''want'' a single line break to appear in the rendered article, use a &lt;code lang=html&gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag or {{Tlx|Break}} template).  However, single line breaks in the source do have certain effects: Within a list, a single line break starts either the next item or a new paragraph; within an indentation (which, if marked up with leading colons, is really the definition part of a definition list), a single line break aborts the indentation and starts a new paragraph. [[Wikipedia:Links|Links]] do not span line breaks (this is intentional, so that authors do not accidentally turn an entire paragraph into a link etc.).

Regardless, some Wikipedians insert single line breaks into the source text of articles for various reasons; others oppose this practice.
Readers do not need to care about this controversy since it does not affect the appearance of articles.
The two positions are presented below. See the [[Wikipedia talk:Use line breaks|discussion page]] for the current head count for each position.

== Do not use single line breaks ==

Do not use manually entered hard line breaks within paragraphs when editing articles. Reasons for this include:

* If you want to indent a paragraph that includes single line breaks, you first have to remove them.
* If you want to make a list item out of a paragraph that includes single line breaks, you first have to remove them.
* If you want to turn a phrase that contains a line break into a link, or format it in bold or italics, you have to remove the line break first. 
* Many readers expect line breaks only where there is a logical, semantic break. Line breaks in source text will make them pause and search for such a break, and be frustrated when there is none. Consider this example:
*:The consequences of this Amendment to American society have been profound. First Amendment questions have been raised with regard to the separation&lt;br /&gt;of church and state; civil rights issues; pornography and obscenity; political speech and organizations; journalism and its restrictions; involuntary commitment laws; and many more.
* Text is no longer wrapped at the window edge of the text entry area, but where the author chose to make the linebreak. Thus, there will be a lot of whitespace within a paragraph, which may be considered a waste of space and visually distracting.
* The appearance of the article source text becomes different from the appearance of the rendered output; it therefore becomes harder to find a sentence of the rendered output in the source text. Since writers often think in terms of paragraphs, it makes sense to organize the text that way. 
* Single line breaks in source texts may confuse new editors, who may think they are there for a special reason, and avoid editing these paragraphs because they fear they will break something.

Proponents of line breaks within paragraphs claim that they make diffs (the reports showing the differences between two revisions of an article) easier to read.
The diff feature highlights the changes within each line break delimited block of text
and provides unchanged text for additional context up to the third line break below and above that text.
This usually means that it highlights the entire paragraph, and shows one paragraph above and below it for context.
The changed characters are separately highlighted from the changed blocks in a different color.

It is hard to see how individual line breaks help in any way in that comparison, since their only effect will be to reduce the amount of context provided when a line is changed. In fact, arbitrarily entered [http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Ambrose_the_poet&amp;diff=106339&amp;oldid=40753 line breaks ''prevent'' the software from working correctly]: instead of providing the context of a full paragraph, it only shows changes in individual lines of text, respecting not even sentence boundaries.

One undeniable advantage of line breaks within paragraphs is that many [[Unix]] editors do not handle long lines well – they can either wrap characters at the screen boundary, wrap words at a fixed length, or not wrap at all. However, by this logic, line breaks would have to be entered at a fixed width, such as 80 characters, something which most proponents of the &quot;use single line breaks&quot; rule do not want and which, as seen above, completely breaks the diff context feature. Just inserting line breaks into some paragraphs will not make them easier to edit with these tools. Arguably, those who use editors which cannot handle long lines properly should just get better ones. Microsoft Notepad has had this functionality since its very first version, Gedit has it, [[vi]] supports it with the &quot;set lbr&quot; option, and every major graphical [[web browser]] has proper word wrapping even on Unix platforms.

== Use single line breaks ==

Use frequent manually entered hard line breaks within paragraphs when editing the source code of articles,
at least at the end of every sentence, but also in other places as needed.
Manually entered hard line breaks arguably make the article much easier to ''edit'' when the lines
of input text are short.
(The &quot;source code&quot;, &quot;wiki text&quot;, or &quot;input text&quot; is what editors see and change in the text box of the &quot;edit this page&quot; form;
the displayed text is what is shown to the reader.)

One benefit is that the line breaks make [[diff]]s smaller and (arguably) easier to read,
and this was especially true before the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2012-04-23/Technology_report#MediaWiki_releases_edge_forward|changes to the styling of diffs made in 2012]].
In addition, if there is a line break at least at the end of every sentence,
editors can easily locate, rearrange, or modify sentences within a long paragraph.
Since writers often think in terms of sentences, it makes sense to organize the text that way.
This section of the article, for instance, is broken into multiple lines, largely at clause boundaries.

The article on [[Steaming]] is one good example on how the ''diff'' algorithm fails miserably. 
The &quot;very minor&quot; changes dated ''03:48, January 19, 2006'', by user ''64.69.92.30'' in the revision history[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steaming&amp;diff=35803807&amp;oldid=33240110], 
show how the minor changes failed to show up as what they actually are because the minor changes to consecutive paragraphs throw ''diff'' totally off base.
It would have avoided such a big mess if the paragraphs were broken into one line per sentence,
as ''diff'' would have found consecutive identical sentences.

Finally, a rebuttal of many of the above points:

* MediaWiki software does not allow line breaks in the middle of a paragraph indented with &quot;:&quot;, but paragraphs that should be indented are generally shorter than other paragraphs.
* MediaWiki software does not allow line breaks in the middle of a list item, but items in a bulleted list (using &quot;*&quot;) or numbered list (using &quot;#&quot;) are generally shorter than paragraphs. In fact, it is easier to convert the individual sentences of a properly line-broken paragraph to list items or [[Template:Prose|vice versa]].
* MediaWiki software does not allow line breaks in the middle of a link, but linked phrases generally do not start in one [[clause]] and end in another.
* Many editors insert line breaks into the source code only where there is a logical, semantic break. Consider this example:
*:The consequences of this Amendment to American society have been profound.&lt;br&gt;First Amendment questions have been raised with regard to&lt;br&gt;the separation of church and state;&lt;br&gt;civil rights issues;&lt;br&gt;pornography and obscenity;&lt;br&gt;political speech and organizations;&lt;br&gt;journalism and its restrictions;&lt;br&gt;involuntary commitment laws;&lt;br&gt;and many more.
* Text is no longer wrapped only at the window edge of the text entry area, but where the author chose to make the linebreak. Thus, there will be a lot of whitespace within a paragraph, which reinforces the semantic breaks.
* The appearance of the article source text has always been different from the appearance of the rendered output. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[line break]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains brackets, but it is rendered as [[line break]], which does not.

Two of Wikipedia's [[wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|rules to consider]].
Both of these guidelines are controversial.

== Contribute what you know or are willing to learn more about ==

Contribute what you know or are willing to learn about. One of the things that makes the Wikipedia great is that anybody can contribute, however this creates a problem to whether the information posted is true, but another thing that makes it great is that it encourages Wikipedians to stretch their interests and learn about new things, so that they can add to the 'pedia. A third great thing is that it's so easy to create new articles and to learn to wikify articles. 

Some users see the ease in which new articles can be created as problematic. Many [[Wikipedia:user|user]]s know something about a subject, but few have exhaustive knowledge of the subject they are writing about. That leads to users creating [[wikipedia:stub|stub]]s (very short articles) that need to be extended by someone with more knowledge before the article can be useful to anyone. This irritates some because it leaves a lot of unfinished work in Wikipedia. 

Other users have diametrically opposite views of stubs, that an [[iterative development|iterative style of development]] can indeed be beneficial. They feel that the problem described above isn't a problem but a part of the normal [[Wikipedia:wiki process|wiki process]], that a not-so-good article is better      than no article at all.

== Always make articles as complete as possible ==
''(an alternative phrasing)  '' 

Whenever you create a new article, always try to make it as complete and comprehensive as possible.  However, an article that is seriously incomplete but a useful start is welcome, too. But first check so that the article you are about to create doesn't already exist in Wikipedia. Or maybe your new information would be better placed in an already existing article? If you are a [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|newcomer to Wikipedia]], concentrate on adding ''content''; do not worry too much about [[Help:Editing|formatting]]. If anything your edits should cause other editors to get involved by reverting and or further re-editing the article (see [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle]]).</text>

'''Do not make personal attacks''' anywhere on Wikipedia. Comment on &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, not on the &lt;em&gt;contributor&lt;/em&gt;. Personal attacks harm the Wikipedia community and the collaborative atmosphere needed to create a good encyclopedia. Derogatory comments about other editors may be removed by any editor. Repeated or egregious personal attacks may lead to sanctions including [[WP:BLOCK|blocks]] or even [[WP:BAN|bans]].
__TOC__

== {{anchor|WHATIS}}What is considered to be a personal attack? ==
{{shortcut|WP:NPA#WHATIS|WP:WIAPA}}
There is no rule that is objective and not open to interpretation on what constitutes a personal attack as opposed to constructive discussion, but some types of comments are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; acceptable:
* Abusive, defamatory, or derogatory phrases based on [[Racist|race]], [[Sexist|sex]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[Ageist|age]], religious or political beliefs, [[Ableist|disabilities]], ethnicity, nationality, etc. directed against another editor or a group of editors. Disagreement over what constitutes a religion, race, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is not a legitimate excuse.
* Using someone's affiliations as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' means of dismissing or discrediting their views—regardless of whether said affiliations are mainstream. An example could be &quot;you're a railfan so what would you know about fashion?&quot; Note that it is not a personal attack to question an editor about their possible [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict of interest]] on a specific article or topic; but beware{{snd}}speculating on the real-life identity of another editor may constitute [[Wikipedia:Harassment#Posting of personal information|outing]].
* Using someone's political affiliations as an ''ad hominem'' means of dismissing or discrediting their views, such as accusing them of being [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] or [[right-wing politics|right-wing]], is also forbidden. Editors are allowed to have personal political POV, as long as it does not negatively affect their editing and discussions.
* Linking to external attacks, harassment, or other material, for the purpose of attacking another editor.
* Comparing editors to [[Nazism|Nazis]], [[Communism|communists]], [[Terrorism|terrorists]], dictators, or other infamous persons. (See also [[Godwin's law]].)
* {{anchor|accusations}}Accusations about personal behavior [[Wikipedia:Casting aspersions|that lack evidence]]. Serious accusations require serious evidence, usually in the form of [[Wikipedia:Complete diff and link guide|diffs and links]].
* Threats, including, but not limited to:
** [[Wikipedia:No legal threats|Threats of legal action]]
** Threats of violence or other off-wiki action (particularly death threats)
** Threats or actions which deliberately expose other Wikipedia editors to political, religious or other [[persecution]] by a government, their employer, or any others. Violations of this sort may result in a block for an extended period of time, which may be applied immediately by any administrator upon discovery. Admins applying such sanctions should confidentially notify the members of the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]] of what they have done and why.
** Threats to [[WP:OUTING|out]] (give out personal details about) an editor.

These examples are not exhaustive. Insulting or disparaging an editor is a personal attack &lt;em&gt;regardless of the manner in which it is done&lt;/em&gt;. When in doubt, comment on the article's content without referring to its contributor at all.

== Why personal attacks are harmful ==
Personal attacks are disruptive. On article talk pages they tend to move the discussion away from the article and towards individuals. Such attacks tend to draw battle lines and make it more difficult for editors to work together.

Contributors often wish to have their viewpoints included in articles. Through reasoned debate, contributors can synthesize these views into a single article, and this creates a better, more [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral]] article for everyone. Every person who edits an article is part of the same larger community—we are all [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]].

The prohibition against personal attacks applies equally to all Wikipedians. It is as unacceptable to attack a user with a history of foolish or boorish behavior, or one who has been [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]], [[Wikipedia:Banning policy|banned]], or otherwise [[Wikipedia:Sanctions|sanctioned]], as it is to attack any other user. Wikipedia encourages a [[Wikipedia:Civility|civil community]]: people make mistakes, but they are encouraged to learn from them and change their ways. Personal attacks are contrary to this spirit and damaging to the work of building an encyclopedia.

== Avoiding personal attacks ==
{{Policy shortcut|WP:AVOIDYOU}}
{{redirect|WP:AVOIDYOU|the guideline on avoiding second-person pronouns in articles|MOS:YOU}}
As a matter of polite and effective discourse, arguments should not be personalized; that is, they should be directed at content and actions rather than people.

When there are disagreements about &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, referring to other editors is not always a personal attack. A posting that says &quot;Your statement about &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; is wrong because of information at &lt;var&gt;Y&lt;/var&gt;&quot;, or &quot;The paragraph you inserted into the article looks like [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]&quot;, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a personal attack. However, &quot;The statement...&quot; or &quot;The paragraph inserted...&quot; is less likely to be misinterpreted as a personal attack because it avoids referring to the other editor in the &lt;em&gt;[[Grammatical person#Grammatical person in English|second person]]&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;The paragraph inserted here [diff] into the article looks like [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]&quot; is especially advantageous because the [[Help:Diff|diff]] cuts down confusion. Similarly, discussion of a user's conduct or history is not in itself a personal attack when done in the appropriate forum for such discussion (for example, the other editor's talk page, or [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]]).

Editors should be [[Wikipedia:Civility|civil]] and adhere to good [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|etiquette]] when describing disagreements. The appropriate response to an inflammatory statement is to address the issues of content rather than to accuse the other person of violating this policy. Accusing someone of making personal attacks without providing a [[#accusations|justification]] for your accusation is also considered a form of personal attack. (See also: [[Wikipedia:Civility#Incivility|Incivility]].)

== Responding to personal attacks ==
=== First offenses and isolated incidents ===
Often the best way to respond to an isolated personal attack is to simply [[Wikipedia:Ignore personal attacks|ignore it]]. Sometimes personal attacks are not meant as attacks at all, and during heated and [[m:Wikistress|stressful]] debates editors tend to overreact. Additionally, because Wikipedia discussions are in a [[Computer-mediated communication|text-only medium]], nuances and emotions are often conveyed poorly, which can easily lead to misunderstanding (see [[Emotions in virtual communication]]). While personal attacks &lt;em&gt;are not excused&lt;/em&gt; because of these factors, editors are encouraged to disregard angry and ill-mannered postings of others, if it is reasonable to do so, and to continue to focus their efforts on improving and developing the encyclopedia.

If you feel that a response is necessary and desirable, you can leave a polite message on the other user's talk page. Avoid responding on a talk page of an article, as this tends to escalate matters. Likewise, it is important to [[Wikipedia:Don't call the kettle black|avoid becoming hostile and confrontational yourself]], even in the face of abuse. Although [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace/Multi-level templates#Personal attacks|templates]] may be used for this purpose, a customized message relating to the specific situation may be [[Wikipedia:Don't template the regulars|better received]]. If possible, try to find a compromise or common ground regarding the underlying issues of content, rather than argue about behavior.

Attacks that are particularly offensive or disruptive (such as physical threats, legal threats, or blatantly bigoted insults) should not be ignored. Extraordinary situations that require immediate intervention are rare, but may be reported at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]].

Discussion of behavior in an appropriate forum (e.g. user's talk page or Wikipedia noticeboard) does not in itself constitute a personal attack.

=== Recurring attacks ===
Recurring, non-disruptive personal attacks that do not stop after reasoned requests to cease can be resolved through [[Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution]]. In most circumstances, problems with personal attacks can be resolved if editors work together and focus on content, and immediate administrator action is not required.

=== Removal of personal attacks ===
{{Policy shortcut|WP:RPA}}
{{See also|Wikipedia:Civility#Removing uncivil comments}}
Derogatory comments about other editors may be removed by any editor. However, there is no official policy regarding when or whether most personal attacks should be removed, although it has been a topic of substantial debate. Removing unquestionable personal attacks from your own user talk page is rarely a matter of concern. On other talk pages, especially where such text ''is directed against you'', removal should typically be limited to clear-cut cases where it is obvious the text is a true personal attack. The {{tl|RPA}} template can be used for this purpose.

Nevertheless, unusual circumstances do exist.  The most serious types of personal attacks, such as efforts to reveal nonpublic personal information about Wikipedia editors ([[WP:OUTING|outing]]), go beyond the level of mere invective, and so can and should be removed for the benefit of the community and the project whether or not they are directed at you. In certain cases involving sensitive information, a [[WP:RFO|request for oversight]] may also be appropriate.

=== Off-wiki attacks ===
Wikipedia cannot regulate behavior in media not under the control of the Wikimedia Foundation, but personal attacks made elsewhere create doubt about the good faith of an editor's on-wiki actions. Posting personal attacks or [[Wikipedia:Libel|defamation]] off-Wikipedia is harmful to the community and to an editor's relationship with it, especially when such attacks violate an editor's privacy. Such attacks can be regarded as aggravating factors by administrators and are admissible evidence in the dispute-resolution process, including Arbitration cases.

=== External links ===
{{For|policies related to attacks against living persons in general, whether or not they edit Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons}}
Linking to off-site harassment, attacks, or privacy violations against persons who edit Wikipedia for the purpose of attacking another person who edits Wikipedia is never acceptable. Attacking, harassing, or violating the privacy of any person who edits Wikipedia through the posting of external links is not permitted. ''Harassment in this context may include but is not limited to linking to offsite personal attacks, privacy violations, and/or threats of physical violence.'' This is not to be confused with legitimate critique. The inclusion of links in articles is a matter for sound editorial judgment.

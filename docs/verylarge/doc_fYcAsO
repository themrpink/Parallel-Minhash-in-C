Swansea had a population of 241,300 in 2014; the second most [[List of Welsh principal areas by population|populous local authority area]] in Wales after [[Cardiff]]. Together with [[Neath]] and [[Port Talbot]], Swansea formed a wider [[Swansea Urban Area|Urban Area]] of 300,352 in 2011.

During the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the [[Copper extraction|copper-smelting]] industry, earning the nickname ''Copperopolis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576322/Swansea|title=Swansea|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=9 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122101250/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576322/Swansea|archive-date=22 January 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, S.

== Etymologies ==
The [[Welsh toponymy|Welsh name]], ''Abertawe'', translates as ''&quot;mouth/estuary of the Tawe&quot;'' and it is likely this name was used for the area before a settlement was established. The first written record of the Welsh name for the town itself dates from 1150 and appears in the form ''Aper Tyui''.&lt;ref&gt;See Place-Names in Glamorgan, Gwynedd O. Pierce, p 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern name, ''Swansea'', pronounced {{IPA|/ˈswɒnzi/}} (Swans-ee, not 
Swan-sea), is derived from the [[Old Norse]] name of the original [[Viking]] trading post that was founded by King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] (c.960–1014).&lt;ref name=&quot;William2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= David William|title= Life in the United Kingdom: The Land and the People|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx3ATOg_MSoC&amp;pg=PA247|date= October 2010|publisher= Intercontinental Books|isbn= 978-9987-16-017-4|page= 247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser1952&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Maxwell Fraser|title= Wales|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W1sKAQAAMAAJ|year= 1952|publisher= Hale|page= 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Glanmor Williams |title= Swansea, An Illustrated History |publisher= Christopher Davies |date= 26 July 2007|isbn= 978-0-7154-0714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, it was the name of the king, 'Svein' or 'Sweyn' with the suffix of '-ey', &quot;island&quot; referring to either a bank of the river at its mouth, or an area of raised ground in marshland.&lt;ref&gt;Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R. (2008) ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. Llandysul: Gomer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Norse termination ''-ey'', can mean &quot;inlet&quot; and the name may simply refer to the mouth of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Alban|first= JR|title= Swansea 1184–1984|year= 1984|publisher= Swansea City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Swansea}}

===Ancient history===
The area around Swansea has a unique [[Archaeology|archaeological history]] dating back to the [[Palaeolithic]]. Finds at [[Long Hole Cave]] on the [[Gower Peninsula]] have been interpreted as that of the first modern humans in Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinnis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinnis|first1=R|title=Identification Of Longhole (Gower) As An Aurignacian Site|journal=Lithics: The Journal of the Lithic Studies Society|date=2012|volume=33|pages=17–29|url=http://journal.lithics.org/index.php/lithics/article/view/347|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same area is also home to the [[Red Lady of Paviland|oldest ceremonial burial]] in Western Europe, discovered at [[Paviland]] in 1823, and dated to 22,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|first=Ewen|last=Callaway|authorlink=|title=Archaeology: Date with history|date=2 May 2012|volume=485|pages=27–29|issue=7396|doi=10.1038/485027a|pmid=22552075|bibcode=2012Natur.485...27C|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area also has many [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] sites, such as the burial mound at Cillibion and the [[hill fort]] at Cil Ifor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis-HoW&quot;&gt;''A History of Wales'', John Davies, Penguin, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the remains of a [[Roman villa]] again on the Gower peninsula.

===Medieval Swansea=== 
The area that would become Swansea is located on the eastern edge of the [[cwmwd]] of Gwyr, in the Cantref Eginawc, the easternmost Cantref of [[Ystrad Tywi]]. The area was noted for its valuable land and was highly contested by the early Welsh kingdoms. During the [[Viking Age]], the mouth of the Tawe became a focus for trade, and a trade post may have been founded sometime between the 9th and 11th centuries. When the Normans took control of the settlement, they built [[Swansea Castle]] {{circa|1106}} and minted coins bearing the names ''Swensi'', ''Sweni'' and ''Svenshi'' {{circa|1140}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A hoard of coins found at [[Rhiwbina]] in the north of [[Cardiff]] in 1980 contained ... minted at Swansea ''c.'' 1140 and bore abbreviated forms of the name: SWENSI, SWENS, SVEN, SWENI, SVENSHI.&quot; Quoted from ''Place-names in Glamorgan'', Gwynedd O. Pierce, 2002. {{ISBN|1-898937-57-5}}; pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[charter]] was granted sometime between 1158 and 1184 by William de Newburgh, 3rd [[Earl of Warwick]]. This charter contains the earliest reference in English to ''Sweynesse'' and gave it the status of a [[borough]], granting the townsmen (called [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 [[John of England|King John]] granted a second charter, in which the name appears as ''Sweyneshe''. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as ''Sweyse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Swansea |volume=26 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Swansea/Timeline.html | title= Swansea Timeline | publisher= Genuki | year= 2007 | accessdate= 29 July 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070705060006/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Swansea/Timeline.html | archive-date= 5 July 2007 | url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Norman conquest]], a [[Welsh Marches|marcher lordship]] was granted by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] under the title of [[Gower (Lordship)|Gower]]. It included land around [[Swansea Bay]] as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself. Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received a [[Municipal charter|borough charter]] at some point between 1158 and 1184 (and a more elaborate one in 1304).&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;&gt;The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales.

===Industrial Revolution===

[[File:View of the Copper-works, Swansea, Glamorganshire.jpeg|thumb|A romanticised depiction of early copper smelting works in the Lower Swansea Valley ({{circa}} 1800)]]

From the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading [[Copper extraction|copper-smelting]] area.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters is now active.

The port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in [[coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; After the invention of the [[reverbatory furnace]] in the late 1600s, copper smelting was able to use coal rather than more-expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than send the coal to Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Symonds, The Mining and Smelting of Copper in England and Wales, Thesis, Coventry University, Jan. 2003, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunt, British Mining (London: Crosby Lockwood, 1887) 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More [[coal mining|coal mines]] opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to [[Clyne Valley Country Park|Clyne]] and [[Llangyfelach]]. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining. .&lt;ref name=&quot;H. Dennis 1963&quot;&gt;W. H. Dennis, 100 Years of Metallurgy (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smelters also processed [[arsenic]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and other metals. Nearby factories produced [[tinplate]] and [[pottery]]. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Otis E. Young Jr., ''Western Mining'', (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1970) 143, 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed &quot;Copperopolis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%—the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than [[Glamorgan]]'s county town, [[Cardiff]], and was the second most populous town in Wales behind [[Merthyr Tydfil]] (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the [[borough]]; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales—in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser, C. and Harris, C.C. (1998) ''The Family and Social Change: A Study of Family and Kinship in a South Wales Town''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from £112 in 1860 to £35 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.&lt;ref name=&quot;H. Dennis 1963&quot;/&gt;
The [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the [[Clyne valley]] to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.

===20th century===
Through the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the [[Lower Swansea Valley]] filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present [[Swansea Enterprise Park|Enterprise Zone]] was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now [[Parc Tawe]] and South Dock became the [[Maritime Quarter|Marina]].

In the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the [[Swansea Blitz]] on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1969 Swansea was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]]&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette, issue no. 44986, 12 December 1969&lt;/ref&gt; to mark [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]'s investiture as the [[Prince of Wales]].

Within the city centre are the ruins of the [[Swansea Castle|castle]], the Marina, the [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]], [[Swansea Museum]], the [[Dylan Thomas Centre]], the [[Environment Centre (Swansea)|Environment Centre]], and the [[Swansea Market|Market]], which is the largest covered market in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to [[Mumbles]]; up the Swansea Valley past [[Landore]] and Morriston to [[Clydach, Swansea|Clydach]]; over [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] and [[Mayhill]] to [[Cwmbwrla]], [[Penlan]], [[Treboeth]] and [[Fforestfach]]; through [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]], [[Sketty]], [[Killay, Swansea|Killay]] to [[Dunvant]]; and east of the river from [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] to [[Bonymaen]], [[Llansamlet]] and [[Birchgrove, Swansea|Birchgrove]]. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by [[Gowerton]], [[Gorseinon]] and [[Loughor]] along with the satellite communities of [[Penllergaer]] and [[Pontarddulais]]. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast—the [[River Loughor|Loughor Estuary]], Swansea Bay and the [[Bristol Channel]].

The geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from [[Carboniferous Limestone]] cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to [[Rhossili|Worm's Head]] and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the [[Loughor estuary]] to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The [[South Wales Coalfield]] reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by [[sandstone]] [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] [[ridge]]s including the prominent [[Cefn Bryn]]. The traditional agricultural landscape consists in a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich [[deciduous]] [[woodland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SwanseaGeography&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitswanseabay.com/media/pdf/o/j/student_info_geography_1.pdf | title=Student information&amp;nbsp;– Swansea geography | publisher=City and County of Swansea | year=2007 | access-date=26 July 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808205931/http://www.visitswanseabay.com/media/pdf/o/j/student_info_geography_1.pdf | archive-date=8 August 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of [[Mawr]]. Areas up to {{convert|185|m|ft|0}} range across the central section: [[Kilvey Hill]], [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] and [[Llwynmawr, Swansea|Llwynmawr]] separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. [[Cefn Bryn]], a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and [[Llanmadoc Hill]] are up to {{convert|193|m|ft|0}} high. The highest point is located [[Penlle'r Castell]] at {{convert|374|m|ft|0}} on the northern border with [[Carmarthenshire]].

==Demographics==
From 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s. In the [[21st century]], Swansea is experiencing a small amount of population growth; the local authority area had an estimated population of 228,100 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2009/090326walespop09en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514052919/http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2009/090326walespop09en.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 May 2009|title=Wales's Population A Demographic Overview 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts===
The [[Swansea Grand Theatre|Grand Theatre]] in the centre of the city is a Victorian theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1997 and which has a capacity of a little over a thousand people. It was opened by the celebrated opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] and was refurbished from 1983 to 1987. The annual programme ranges from pantomime and drama to opera and ballet.
Fluellen Theatre Company is a professional theatre company based in Swansea who perform at the Grand Theatre and the Dylan Thomas Centre. The [[Taliesin Arts Centre|Taliesin building]] on the university campus has a theatre, opened in 1984. Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near [[Gorseinon]]. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at [[Oystermouth Castle]], and [[Singleton Park]] is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor [[Proms]]. A folk festival is held on Gower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/festivals_000.htm | title=The Living Tradition Festival Listing, 2007 | publisher=The Living Tradition | year=2007 | accessdate=26 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730050914/http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/festivals_000.htm | archive-date=30 July 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the [[Patti Pavilion]]; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The [[Brangwyn Hall]] is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for [[Swansea University]]. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/brangwyn.shtml | title=Brangwyn Hall &amp; The Empire Panels | publisher=BBC | year=2006 | accessdate=27 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405174517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/brangwyn.shtml | archive-date=5 April 2006 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swansea is home to the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea|Palace Theatre]]. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.

In 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Florence + The Machine]] and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at £18 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/tickets-swanseas-biggest-weekend-sold-14277218|title=Tickets for Swansea's Biggest Weekend sold out in minutes|author=Katie Bellis|website=WalesOnline|access-date=27 May 2018|date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527202504/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/tickets-swanseas-biggest-weekend-sold-14277218|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welsh language===
There are many [[Welsh language]] chapels and churches in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward [[Mawr]] are able to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]], as can 38% of the ward of [[Pontarddulais (electoral ward)|Pontarddulais]]. [[Clydach (electoral ward)|Clydach]], [[Kingsbridge, Swansea|Kingsbridge]] and [[Upper Loughor]] all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than [[Penderry]] and [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] wards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php?id=2082.6 |title=Results of the 2001 Census of Population on the Language in Electoral Wards |publisher=Welsh Language Board |year=2007 |access-date=26 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090448/http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php?id=2082.6 |archive-date=20 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique feature is the use of semi-circular arches. The building has been described as the &quot;Nonconformist Cathedral of Wales&quot; and has been listed as Grade I on the basis that it is &quot;the most ambitious grand chapel in Wales, its interior and fittings remain virtually unaltered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llgc.org.uk/ardd/pensaeri/arch010.htm |title=Libanus (Tabernacle) Chapel, Morriston |work=Religious Architecture |publisher=The National Library of Wales |accessdate=30 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601040751/https://www.llgc.org.uk/ardd/pensaeri/arch010.htm |archive-date=1 June 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guildhall is one of the main office buildings in the centre of the city and was designed by [[Percy Thomas]] and opened in 1934. It is faced in white [[Portland stone]] and includes a tall clock-tower which makes it a landmark. The building comprises the City Hall, the [[Brangwyn Hall]] concert venue and the County Law Courts. It is considered &quot;the most important building in Wales of its period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-14594-swansea-new-guildhall-uplands |title=Swansea New Guildhall |publisher=British Listed Buildings |accessdate=30 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235749/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-14594-swansea-new-guildhall-uplands |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
{{see also|Category:People from Swansea|List of people from Swansea}}
[[File:Statue of Dylan Thomas, Swansea.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Thomas in Swansea|alt=A bronze statue of Thomas in the Maritime Quarter, Swansea]]
The poet [[Dylan Thomas]] is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby [[Cwmdonkin Park]]; he described Swansea as an &quot;ugly lovely town&quot;. In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as [[The Kardomah Gang]], which met in the [[Kardomah Café]] which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/dylan-thomas-and-the-kardomah-set-525736.html|title=Dylan Thomas and the Kardomah set|work=The Independent|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907032951/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/dylan-thomas-and-the-kardomah-set-525736.html|archive-date=7 September 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, the [[Vivian family (British Isles)|Vivian family]] did much to develop Swansea. Their wealth and influence came from large copper-mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea ([[Vivian &amp; Sons]]), and is still visible today in their former family residences: [[Singleton Abbey]] (now used by [[Swansea University]]), [[Sketty Hall]], [[Clyne Castle]] and [[Clyne Gardens]]. [[Henry Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea|Henry Vivian]] became the first [[Baron Swansea|Lord Swansea]] in 1893.

==Voyager Golden Record==
{{main|Voyager Golden Record}}
Both spacecraft carry a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170905&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferris-201205&quot; /&gt; The record is intended as a combination [[time capsule]] and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included [[Timothy Ferris]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferris-201205&quot; /&gt; and was chaired by [[Carl Sagan]].

== ''Pale Blue Dot'' ==
{{main|Pale Blue Dot}}
The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as a ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'', taken in 1990 by ''Voyager 1'', and popularized by Carl Sagan,

{{quote|Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.}}

{{Wikiquote|patience}}
'''&lt;span lang=&quot;en-au&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Patience&lt;/span&gt;''' (or '''[[wikt:forbearance#English|forbearance]]''') is the ability to endure difficult circumstances such as perseverance in the face of delay; tolerance of provocation without responding in annoyance/[[anger]]; or forbearance when under strain, especially when faced with longer-term difficulties. Patience is the level of endurance one can have before negativity. It is also used to refer to the [[character trait]] of being steadfast. [[Antonyms]] include [[Wiktionary: hasty|hastiness]] and [[wiktionary: impetuous|impetuousness]].

== Scientific perspectives ==
{{See also|Delayed gratification|Reward dependence|Reward system}}

In [[psychology]] and in [[cognitive neuroscience]], patience is studied as a [[decision-making]] problem, involving the choice of either a small reward in the short-term, versus a more valuable reward in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O.,G.,J.|first=Al-Ubaydli,Jones,Weel|date=2013|title=Patience, cognitive skill, and coordination in the repeated stag hunt.|journal=Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics|volume=6|issue=2|pages=71–96|doi=10.1037/npe0000005|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/27723/1/MPRA_paper_27723.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study involving [[common marmoset]]s and [[cottontop tamarin]]s, animals of both species faced a [[self-control]] [[Elysium|paradigm in which individuals chose between taking an immediate small reward and waiting a variable amount of time for a large reward]]. Under these conditions, marmosets waited significantly longer for food than tamarins. This difference cannot be explained by life history, social behaviour or brain size. It can, however, be explained by feeding ecology: marmosets rely on [[Gum (botany)|gum]], a food product acquired by waiting for exudate to flow from trees, whereas tamarins feed on [[insect]]s, a food product requiring impulsive action. [[Foraging]] ecology, therefore, may provide a selective pressure for the evolution of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The ecology and evolution of patience in two New World monkeys |journal= Biology Letters|volume= 1|issue= 2|pages= 223–226|pmc=1626214|year= 2005|last1= Stevens|first1= J.

[[File:Abandonment rate of online video users for different Internet connectivities.jpg|thumbnail|Patience in waiting for a video to start is impacted by the Internet speeds that one is accustomed to.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.cs.umass.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/HOME_files/imc208-krishnan.pdf| title= Video Stream Quality Impacts Viewer Behavior, by Krishnan and Sitaraman, ACM Internet Measurement Conference, Nov 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users accustomed to faster Internet connectivity (e.g., fiber) abandon a slow-loading video at a faster rate than users with slower Internet connectivity (e.g., cable or mobile).]]

Patience of human users in the online world has been the subject of much recent scientific research. In a 2012 study&lt;ref name=&quot;people.cs.umass.edu&quot;/&gt; involving tens of millions of users who watched videos on the Internet, Krishnan and [[Ramesh Sitaraman|Sitaraman]]  show that online users lose patience in as little as two seconds while waiting for their chosen video to start playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that users who are connected to the Internet at faster speeds are less patient than their counterparts connected at slower speeds, demonstrating a link between the human expectation of speed and human patience. These and other scientific studies of patience have led many social commentators to conclude that the rapid pace of technology is rewiring humans to be less and less patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonglobe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious perspectives ==
[[File:Three virtues Patientia.jpg|thumb|Three virtues by Jan Saenredam after Hendrik Goltzius. This is plate 2, titled Patientia.]]

=== Judaism ===
Patience and fortitude are prominent themes in [[Judaism]]. The [[Talmud]] extols patience as an important personal trait. The story of Micah, for example, is that he suffers many challenging conditions and yet endures, saying &quot;I will wait for the God who saves me.&quot; Patience in God, it is said, will aid believers in finding the strength to be delivered from the evils that are inherent in the physical life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firestone |first=Reuven |title=Patience |url=http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |accessdate=2008-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117061152/http://www.huc.edu/chronicle/60/patience.shtml |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sefer Torah|Hebrew Torah]], patience is referred to in several proverbs, such as &quot;The patient man shows much good sense, but the quick-tempered man displays folly at its height&quot; ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14:29, NAB); &quot;An ill-tempered man stirs up strife, but a patient man allays discord.&quot; (Proverbs 15:18, NAB); and &quot;A patient man is better than a warrior, and he who rules his temper, than he who takes a city.&quot; (Proverbs 16:32). The emotion is also discussed in other sections, such as Ecclesiastes: &quot;Better is the patient spirit than the lofty spirit. Do not in spirit become quickly discontented, for discontent lodges in the bosom of a fool.&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes]] 7:8-9, NAB).

=== Christianity ===
In the [[Christianity|Christian religion]], patience is one of the most valuable [[virtue|virtues]] of [[Life expectancy|life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford, LLD|first=Thomas|date=1811|title=The Dignity and Duty of Magistrates. A Sermon [on Job Xxix. 14-17] Preached ... at the Assizes ... in St. Martin Church, Leicester, August 8, 1811|url=|journal=|publisher=The High-Sheriff and the Grand Jury|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing patience is viewed as the work of the [[Holy Ghost]] in the Christian who has accepted the gift of [[salvation]]. While patience is not one of the traditional biblical three [[theological virtues]] nor one of the traditional [[cardinal virtues]], it is part of the [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]], according to the [[Apostle Paul]] in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]].&lt;ref&gt;See David Baily Harned, ''Patience: How We Wait Upon the World'', rev. ed. (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2015), chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patience was included in [[Seven virtues#Seven virtues and the seven capital sins|later formulations of the seven virtues]].

In the [[Christian Bible]], patience is referred to in several sections. The [[Book of Proverbs]] notes that &quot;through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone&quot; ({{bibleref2|Proverbs|25:14-16|NIV}}, NIV); [[Ecclesiastes]] points out that the &quot;end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride&quot; ({{bibleref2|Ecclesiastes|7:7-9|NIV}}, NIV); and [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] states that we should &quot;be patient with all. See that no one returns evil for evil; rather, always seek what is good for each other and for all&quot; ({{bibleref2|1 Thessalonians|5:14-15|NAB}}, NAB). In the [[Epistle of James]], the Bible urges Christians to be patient, and &quot; see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth,...until it receives the early and the late rains.&quot; ({{bibleref2|James|5:7-11|NAB}}, NAB). In [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], patience is listed as part of the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot;: &quot;love, joy, peace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=1814|title=The Literary Panorama|url=|journal=The Literary Panorama|volume=15|pages=1010|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law&quot;. ({{bibleref2|Galatians|5:21-23|NIV}}, NIV). In Timothy, the Bible states that &quot;Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life&quot;.({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|1:15-17|NIV}} [[NIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harned, David Baily (2015). Patience: How We Wait Upon the World. Afterword: &quot;Leadership and Unnatural Virtues: George Washington and the Patience of Power.&quot; Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Sabr (Islamic term)|l1=Sabr}}

Patience with steadfast belief in [[Allah]] is called ''sabr'' ({{lang-ar|صَبْرٌ ṣabr}}), one of the best virtues of life in Islam. Through [[Sabr (Islamic term)|sabr]], a Muslim believes that an individual can grow closer to God and thus attain true peace. It is also stressed in Islam, that Allah is with those who are patient, more specifically during calamity and suffering. Several verses in Quran urge Muslims to seek Allah's help when faced with fear and loss, with patient prayers and perseverance for Allah. For example:&lt;ref&gt;see also: {{Cite quran|3|195|end=200}}, {{Cite quran|41|24|end=35}}, and {{Cite quran|11|114|end=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits (of your toil), but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere; who say, when afflicted with calamity: &quot;To Allah We belong, and to Him is our return&quot;.|Quran|{{Cite quran|2|155|end=156|expand=no}}}}

Similarly, patience is mentioned in hadith [[Sahih Bukhari]]:

{{quote|Narrated Aisha: I asked Allah’s rasool about the plague. He said, “That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whomsoever He wished, but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but '''has patience and hopes for Allah’s reward''', and knows that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|77|616}}|}}

In Islamic tradition,(''Ayyoob'') illustrates a story where he demonstrated patience and steadfast belief in [[Allah]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] narrates the story in the following manner: Job was a very rich person with much land, and many animals and children — all of which were lost and soon he was struck with disease as a test from Allah. He remained steadfast and patient in his prayers to Allah, so Allah eventually relieved him of the disease, gave him double the money he lost, and raised to life twice the number of children who had died before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ibn Kathir |authorlink= |title=Stories of the Prophet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_053Peu7XSgC |accessdate= |year= 2001|publisher=Dar Al-Manarah | isbn=977-6005-17-9 |pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Kshanti}}

In [[Buddhism]], patience ([[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''kshanti''; [[Pali]]: ''khanti'') is one of the &quot;perfections&quot; (''[[paramita]]s'') that a [[bodhisattva]] trains in and practices to realize perfect enlightenment (''[[bodhi]]''). The Buddhist concept of patience is distinct from the English definition of the word. In Buddhism, patience refers to not returning harm, rather than merely enduring a difficult situation. It is the ability to control one's emotions even when being criticized or attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-ten-perfections-in-theravada-mahayana-and-bon |title=Alexander Berzin, The Ten Perfections in Theravada, Mahayana and Bon, 1995 |publisher=StudyBuddhism.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 184 of the [[Dhammapada]] it is said that 'enduring patience is the highest austerity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buddharakkhita|first1=Acharya|title=Dhammapada, 184|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.budd.html#dhp-184|website=Access to Insight|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===

Patience, in Hindu philosophy, is the cheerful endurance of trying conditions and the consequence of one's action and deeds ([[karma]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gsoy/gsoy06.htm Shankaracharya's Vedānta] Ernest Wood, {{ISBN|978-1425482596}}, see Chapter 4, under GNYANA-YOGA, pp 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the capacity to wait, endure opposites - such as pain and pleasure, cold and heat, sorrows and joys - calmly, without anxiety, and without a desire to seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Nathan (2000), Hinduism that is Sanatana Dharma, {{ISBN|81-7597-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tattvabhushan, S. (1898), Sankvracharya (His life and teaching: a translation of Atma-Bodha), 2nd Edition, The Society for the Resuscitation of Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt; In interpersonal relationships, virtuous ''titiksha'' means that if someone attacks or insults without cause, one must endure it without feeling enmity, anger, resentment or anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, A. and Rigby, A. (2009), [http://curve.coventry.ac.uk/open/file/a9392056-ec87-76d1-89ac-b9b379a28501/1/huntergandhi.pdf Gandhi and the virtue of forgiveness], Gandhi Marg 30 (4), see page 430&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of patience is explained as being more than trust, and as a value that reflects the state of one's body and mind.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; The term ''pariksaha'' is sometimes also translated as test or exam, in other contexts. Some of these concepts have been carried into the spiritual understanding of yoga. Sandilya [[Upanishad]] of Hinduism identifies ten sources of patience and forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. In each of these ten forbearances, the virtuous implicit belief is that our current spirit and the future for everyone, including oneself, will be stronger if these forbearances are one's guide. Each source of those ten pariksaha (patience and forbearances) are:&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3).

* [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) is not being violent to any human being and any living being at any time through one's action, with words one speaks or writes, or in one's thoughts.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T.

* Satya is expressing and acting with truth.
* Asteya is not coveting of another’s property through any act of one’s mind, speech, or body.
* Brahmacharya is willingness to remain a bachelor by one's actions of mind, speech or body.
* Daya is unconditional kindness to everyone and all creatures.
* Arjava is the refusal to deceive or wrong others either by the performance or by non-performance of actions of one's mind, speech or body.
* Kshama is acceptance of suffering while forgiving all pleasant or unpleasant things, such as praise or blow by others.
* Dhriti is the will to remain of calm mind and spirit during periods of gain or loss of wealth or relatives.
* Mitahara is moderation and restraint in consumption of food, drinks and wealth.
* Saucha is the cleansing of the body by earth and water; and of the mind by the pursuit of understanding oneself.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]]'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It too discusses patience and forbearance, dedicating Chapter 16 of Book 1 to it. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' suggests ''patience'' is necessary for an ethical life and one's long term happiness, even if patience is sometimes difficult in the short term. Some of the verse excerpts from this book are: &quot;our conduct must always foster forbearance&quot;; &quot;one must patiently endure rude remarks, because it delivers us to purity&quot;; &quot;if we are unjustly wronged by others, it is best to conquer our hurt with patience, accept suffering, and refrain from unrighteous retaliation&quot;; &quot;it is good to patiently endure injuries done to you, but to forget them is even better&quot;; &quot;just as the Earth bears those who dig into her, one must with patience bear with those who despise us&quot;, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

=== Meher Baba ===
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that &quot;[O]ne of the first requirements of the [spiritual] aspirant is that he should combine ''unfailing enthusiasm with unyielding patience''....Spiritual effort demands not only physical endurance and courage, but also unshrinking forbearance and unassailable moral courage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''3'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 118-119. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
In ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that &quot;being able to wait is so hard that the greatest poets did not disdain to make the inability to wait the theme of their poetry.&quot; He notes that &quot;Passion will not wait&quot;, and gives the example of cases of duels, in which the &quot;advising friends have to determine whether the parties involved might be able to wait a while longer. If they cannot, then a duel is reasonable [because]...to wait would be to continue suffering the horrible torture of offended honor...&quot;.

== Impatience ==

Examples of impatience can be seen in common social situations, such as:
* Traffic - for example a car at a stoplight [[Vehicle horn|honking]] at the car in front of it immediately after the light has turned green, or honking during a [[traffic jam]] which is unlikely to unclog the road. Impatience may be a contributing factor to [[road rage]].
* Complaints or rude behavior while waiting for food at a [[restaurant]]
* Anger at waiting [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]] for telephone service and support

[[Larry Wall]], inventor of the [[Perl]] programming language, declared impatience a virtue which leads programmers to write programs that serve their needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threevirtues.com/ ''The Three Virtues'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trogons''' and '''[[quetzal]]s''' are [[bird]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Trogoniformes''' {{IPAc-en|t|r|oʊ|ˈ|g|ɒ|n|ᵻ|f|ɔr|m|iː|z}} which contains only one family, the '''Trogonidae'''. The family Trogonidae contains 46 species in seven [[genus|genera]]. The [[fossil]] record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the Early [[Eocene]]. They might constitute a member of the basal radiation of the order [[Coraciiformes]] and order [[Passeriformes]]&lt;ref name=Johansson/&gt; or be closely related to [[mousebird]]s and [[owl]]s.&lt;ref name=McCormack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hackett/&gt; The word ''trogon'' is [[greek language|Greek]] for &quot;nibbling&quot; and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests.

Trogons are residents of [[tropical forest]]s worldwide. The greatest [[biodiversity|diversity]] is in the [[Neotropics]], where four genera, containing 24 species, occur. The genus ''[[Apaloderma]]'' contains the three [[Africa]]n [[species]]. The genera ''[[Harpactes]]'' and ''[[Apalharpactes]]'', containing twelve species, are found in southeast Asia.&lt;ref name =&quot;HBW&quot;/&gt;

They feed on [[insect]]s and [[fruit]], and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Trogons are generally not [[bird migration|migratory]], although some species undertake partial local movements. Trogons have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They are the only type of animal with a [[Dactyly#Heterodactyly|heterodactyl]] toe arrangement. They nest in holes dug into trees or termite nests, laying 2–4 white or pastel-coloured eggs.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
[[Image:Dans l'ombre des dinosaures - Masillatrogon - 018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fossil of ''[[Masillatrogon]]'' from [[Messel]]]]
The position of the trogons within the class Aves has been a long-standing mystery.&lt;ref name =&quot;HBW&quot;&gt;Collar, N.J. (2001). &quot;Family Trogonidae (Trogons)&quot;, pp. 80–129 in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. &amp; Sargatal, J. (eds.). (2001) ''Handbook of the Birds of the World, Vol. 6 Mousebirds to Hornbills''. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain. {{ISBN|84-87334-30-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of relations have been suggested, including the parrots, cuckoos, toucans, jacamars and puffbirds, rollers, owls and nightjars. More recent morphological and molecular evidence has suggested a relationship with the [[Coliiformes]]. The unique arrangement of the toes on the foot (see morphology and flight) has led many to consider the trogons to have no close relatives, and to place them in their own order, possibly with the similarly atypical [[mousebird]]s as their closest relatives.

The earliest formally described fossil specimen is a cranium from the [[Fur Formation]] [[Lower Eocene]] in Denmark (54 [[mya (unit)|mya]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristoffersen 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristoffersen| first=Anette Vedding | year=2002| title=An early Paleocene Trogon (Aves: trogoniformes) from the Fur Formation, Denmark|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=22| issue=3|pages=661–666| doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2001)022[0661:AEPTAT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other trogoniform fossils have been found in the [[Messel pit]] deposits from the mid-[[Eocene]] in Germany (49 [[mya (unit)|mya]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayr 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr| first=Gerald | year=2005| title=New trogons from the early Tertiary of Germany|journal=Ibis|volume=147| issue=3|pages=512–518| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919x.2005.00421.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Oligocene and Miocene deposits from Switzerland and France respectively. The oldest New World fossil of a trogon is from the comparatively recent [[Pleistocene]] (less than 2.588 mya).

The family had been thought to have an Old World origin&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa de los Monteros&quot; /&gt; notwithstanding the current richness of the family, which is more diverse in the Neotropical New World. DNA evidence seemed to support an African origin for the trogons, with the African genus ''[[Apaloderma]]'' seemingly basal in the family, and the other two lineages, the Asian and American, breaking off between 20–36 million years ago. More recent studies&lt;ref name=&quot;Moyle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Johansson 2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oliveros|first=Carl H.|last2=Andersen|first2=Michael J.|last3=Hosner|first3=Peter A.|last4=Mauck|first4=William M.|last5=Sheldon|first5=Frederick H.|last6=Cracraft|first6=Joel|last7=Moyle|first7=Robert G.|date=2020|title=Rapid Laurasian diversification of a pantropical bird family during the Oligocene–Miocene transition|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ibi.12707|journal=Ibis|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=137–152|doi=10.1111/ibi.12707|issn=1474-919X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the DNA evidence gives contradictory results concerning the basal phylogenetic relationships; so it is currently unknown if all extant trogons are descended from an African or an American ancestor or neither.

The trogons are split into three subfamilies, each reflecting one of these splits, Aplodermatinae is the African subfamily and contains a single genus, ''Apaloderma.'' Harpactinae is the Asian subfamily and contains two genera, ''Harpactes'' and ''Apalharpactes''. ''Apalharpactes'', consisting of two species in Java and Sumatra, has only recently been accepted as a separate genus from ''Harpactes''.&lt;ref name =&quot;Collar 2002&quot;/&gt; The remaining subfamily, the Neotropical Trogoninae, contains the remaining four genera, ''Trogon, Priotelus, Pharomachrus'' and ''Euptilotis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBW&quot; /&gt;[[File:TrogonPlantarTendon.jpg|thumb|The tendons of the foot, showing the arrangement with a reversed second toe. The plantar tendon on the front (''flexor perforans digitorum'') splits into two sections, and enters the front toes while the hind plantar (''flexor longus hallucis'') splits and enters the hind toes.]]
&lt;nowiki&gt; The two Caribbean species of &lt;/nowiki&gt;''Priotelus'' were formerly different ones (''Temnotrogon'' on Hispaniola), and are extremely ancient. The two quetzal genera, ''Pharomachrus'' and ''Euptilotis'' are possibly derived from the final and most numerous genus of trogons in the Neotropics, ''Trogon''. A 2008 study of the genetics of ''Trogon'' suggested the genus originated in Central America and radiated into South America after the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] (as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]), thus making trogons relatively recent arrivals in South America.&lt;ref name=Dacosta/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Priotelus temnurus -Matanzas Province, Cuba-8.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cuban trogon]] is one of two species restricted to the islands of the Caribbean]]
The majority of trogons are birds of tropical and subtropical forests. They have a cosmopolitan distribution in the worlds wet tropics, being found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A few species are distributed into the temperate zone, with one species, the [[elegant trogon]], reaching the south of the United States, specifically southern Arizona and the surrounding area. The [[Narina trogon]] of Africa is slightly exceptional in that it utilises a wider range of habitats than any other trogon, ranging from dense forest to fairly open savannah, and from the Equator to southern [[South Africa]]. It is the most widespread and successful of all the trogons. The [[eared quetzal]] of Mexico is also able to use more [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric]] habitats, but preferentially inhabits forests. Most other species are more restricted in their habitat, with several species being restricted to undisturbed primary forest. Within forests they tend to be found in the mid-story, occasionally in the canopy.

It has gradually become a major commercial event, with special pastries, flowers and other presents offered by retailers. Day-cares and primary schools often encourage children to make cards and other gifts.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]], Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. Media channels celebrate with special shows. Individuals honor their mothers by giving gifts and commemorative articles. Individuals who have lost their mothers pray and pay their respects to their loved ones lost. Schools hold special programs in order to acknowledge the efforts of their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arynews.tv/en/mothers-day-being-observed-today/|title=World marks Mother's Day with Utmost Love, Respect|access-date=12 June 2017|newspaper=ARY News|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panama====
In [[Panama]], Mother's Day is celebrated on 8 December, the same day as the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]]. This date was suggested in 1930 by the wife of Panama's President [[Florencio Harmodio Arosemena]]. 8 December was adopted as Mother's Day under Law 69, which was passed the same year.&lt;ref name=panama&gt;{{citation |work= [[Crítica]] |title= Bendita Madre |author= editorial |language= es |date= 8 December 2001 |url= http://www.critica.com.pa/archivo/12082001/opinion.html |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927162051/http://www.critica.com.pa/archivo/12082001/opinion.html |archivedate= 27 September 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another account, in 1924 the [[Rotary Club]] of Panama asked that Mother's Day be celebrated on 11 May. Politician Aníbal D. Ríos changed the proposal so that the celebration would be held on 8 December. He then established Mother's Day as a national holiday on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Origins.

====Paraguay====
In [[Paraguay]], Mother's Day is celebrated on 15 May, the same day as the ''Dia de la Patria'', which celebrates the [[History of Paraguay#Independence|independence of Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=paraguay1/&gt; This date was chosen to honor the role played by Juana María de Lara in the events of 14 May 1811 that led to Paraguay's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Session of the Honorable Cámara de Senadores.

In 2008, the Paraguayan Minister of Culture, Bruno Barrios, lamented this coincidence because, in Paraguay, Mother's Day is much more popular than independence day and the independence celebration goes unnoticed. As a result, Barrios asked that the celebration be moved to the end of the month.&lt;ref name=paraguay2/&gt; A group of young people attempted to gather 20,000 signatures to ask the Parliament to move Mother's Day.&lt;ref name=paraguay2&gt;{{citation|title=Buscan que se cambie fecha del día de la madre|date=14 May 2008|work=Radio Viva 90.1 FM Paraguay|url=http://www.radioviva.com.py/articulo.php?ID=2478}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the ''Comisión de festejos'' (Celebration Committee) of the city of [[Asunción]] asked that Mother's Day be moved to the second Sunday of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=27 July 2008|title=Hoy miércoles 27 de agosto se inician las acciones de la Comisión de Festejos por el Bicentenario, con una retreta en la Plaza de los Héroes|author=Municipality of [[Asuncion]]|url=http://www.mca.gov.py/noticias/270808_2.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510082053/http://www.mca.gov.py/noticias/270808_2.htm|archivedate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], Mother's Day is officially celebrated on the second Sunday of May, but it is not a public holiday.&lt;ref name=proclamation1998&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1998/12/11/proclamation-no-58-s-1998/ | title=Proclamation No. 58, s. 1998 | newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]] | date=11 December 1998 | accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a traditional Filipino holiday, the occasion owes its popularity to [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American Colonial Period]] influence.

According to a 2008 article by the [[Philippine News Agency]], in 1921 the [[Ilocos Norte]] Federation of Women's Clubs asked to declare the first Monday of December as Mother's Day &quot;to honor these fabulous women who brought forth God's children into this world.&quot; In response, [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Charles Yeater]] issued Circular No. 33 declaring the celebration. In 1937 [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] issued Presidential Proclamation No. 213, changing the name of the occasion from &quot;Mother's Day&quot; to &quot;Parent's Day&quot; to address the complaints that there wasn't a &quot;Father's Day&quot;. In 1980 President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Presidential Proclamation No. 2037 proclaiming the date as both Mother's Day and Father's Day. In 1988 President [[Corazon Aquino]] issued Presidential Proclamation No. 266, changing Mother's Day to the second Sunday of May, and Father's Day to the third Sunday of June, discontinuing the traditional date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The First Monday of December is Mother's Day and Father's Day |date= 1 December 2014 |author= Content Manager 03 |publisher= [[Malacañan Palace]] (official residence of the [[President of the Philippines]]) |url= http://malacanang.gov.ph/74663-the-first-monday-of-december-is-mothers-day-and-fathers-day/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 President [[Joseph Estrada]] returned both celebrations to the first Monday of December.&lt;ref name=proclamation1998/&gt;

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]], the &quot;Dia da Mãe&quot; (&quot;Mother's Day&quot;) is an unofficial holiday held each year on the first Sunday of May (sometimes coinciding with [[May Day#Portugal|Labour Day]]). The weeks leading up to this Sunday, school children spend a few hours a day to prepare a gift for their mothers, aided by their school teachers. In general, mothers receive gifts by their family members and this day is meant to be celebrated with the whole family.
It used to be celebrated on 8 December, the same date of the Conception of the Virgin celebration.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Romania====
In [[Romania]], Mother's Day has been celebrated on the first Sunday of May since 2010. Law 319/2009 made both Mother's Day and Father's Day official holidays in Romania. The measure was passed thanks to campaign efforts from the Alliance Fighting Discrimination Against Fathers (TATA).&lt;ref name=&quot;romania&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Romania Celebrates Fathers' Day On Second Sunday Of May|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/english/romania-celebrates-fathers-day-on-second-sunday-of-may-6088334|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=[[Mediafax]]|date=4 May 2010|location=Bucharest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129091127/http://www.mediafax.ro/english/romania-celebrates-fathers-day-on-second-sunday-of-may-6088334|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Mother's Day was celebrated on 8 March, as part of [[International Women's Day]] (a tradition dating back to when Romania was part of the [[Eastern bloc]]).

Women's Day was first celebrated on the last Sunday in February in 1913 in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|title=About International Women's Day|website=International Women's Day|access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, demonstrations marking International Women's Day in [[Saint Petersburg]] on the last Sunday in February (which fell on 8 March on the [[Gregorian calendar]]) initiated the [[February Revolution]]. Following the [[October Revolution]] later that year, the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] persuaded [[Vladimir Lenin]] to make it an official holiday in the Soviet Union, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

On 8 May 1965, by the decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the Soviet Union &quot;in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their [[Fatherland]] during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]], in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last =Балаховская| first =Л.

====Samoa====
In [[Samoa]], Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in May, and as a recognised national holiday on the Monday following.

====Singapore====
In [[Singapore]], Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is not recognized as a holiday by the government.

====Slovakia====
[[Czechoslovakia]] celebrated only Women's Day until the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989. After the country split in 1993, [[Slovakia]] started celebrating both Women's Day and Mother's Day. The politicization of Women's Day has affected the official status of Mother's Day. Center-right parties want Mother's Day to replace Women's Day, and social-democrats want to make Women's Day an official holiday. Currently, both days are festive, but they are not &quot;state holidays&quot;. In the Slovak Republic, Mother's Day is celebrated every second Sunday in May.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastern&quot;/&gt;

====South Africa====
In [[South Africa]], Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is not recognized as a holiday by the government. The tradition is to give cards and gifts and to serve mothers breakfast in bed or to go out to lunch together as a family.

====South Sudan====
In [[South Sudan]], Mother's Day is celebrated on the first Monday in July. The president [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] proclaimed Mother's Day as the first Monday in July after handing over from Sudan. Children in South Sudan are presenting mothers with gifts and flowers. The first Mother's Day was held in that country on 2 July 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Spain====
In Spain, Mother's Day or Día de la Madre is celebrated on the first Sunday of May. The weeks leading up to this Sunday, school children spend a few hours a day to prepare a gift for their mothers, aided by their school teachers. In general, mothers receive gifts by their family members &amp; this day is meant to be celebrated with the whole family. It is also said to be celebrated in May, as May is the month dedicated to the Virgin Mary (mother of Jesus) according to Catholicism.The idea of a month dedicated specifically to Mary can be traced back to baroque times. Although it wasn't always held during May, Mary Month included thirty daily spiritual exercises honoring Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/mfenelon/why-is-may-the-month-of-mary|title=Why is May the Month of Mary?|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 the Valencian poet [[Julio Menéndez García]] published a ''Hymn to Mother'' in a pamphlet in which he proposed the celebration of Mother's Day in all Spanish-speaking countries. &lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'', 25 September 1925 &lt;/ref&gt; The official declaration was never produced, but at that time the initiative was adopted at a local level on different dates; thus, for example, in Madrid, Mother's Day was celebrated on 4 October 1926.&lt;ref&gt;''La Opinión: diario independiente de la mañana'', 4 October 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 the [[Frente de Juventudes|Youth Front]] of [[FET y de las JONS]] party, promoted the celebration of Mother's Day coinciding with the feast of the Immaculate Conception, on 8 December.

In the early 1960s, on the initiative of a chain of department stores ([[Galerías Preciados]]), which copied the custom established in Cuba, Mother's Day was also celebrated on the first Sunday of May ([[El Corte Inglés]], the great competitor of Galerías Preciados, celebrated the holiday in December). The two dates, May and December, coexisted until 1965 when the ecclesiastical authorities chose to celebrate the festival in May, within the month consecrated to the Virgin, to recover the authentic character of the Day of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;''Nueva Alcarria'', 5 December 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May.

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], Mother's Day was first celebrated in 1919, by an initiative of the author Cecilia Bååth-Holmberg. It took several decades for the day to be widely recognized. Swedes born in the early nineteen hundreds typically did not celebrate the day because of the common belief that the holiday was invented strictly for commercial purposes. This was in contrast to Father's Day, which has been widely celebrated in Sweden since the late 1970s. Mother's Day in Sweden is celebrated on the last Sunday in May. A later date was chosen to allow everyone to go outside and pick flowers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], the &quot;règle de Pentecôte&quot; law allows Mother's Day to be celebrated a week late if the holiday falls on the same day as Pentecost. In 2008, merchants declined to move the date.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= La Fête des Mères 2008 ne sera pas reportée |language= fr |author= Fleurop-Interflora (Suisse) |date= 22 April 2008 |url= http://www.presseportal.ch/fr/print.htx?nr=100559568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This holiday has its roots in the church and was originally unrelated to the American holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; Most historians believe that Mothering Sunday evolved from a medieval practice of visiting one's mother church annually on [[Laetare Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higdon |first1=David Leon |title=The Wife of Bath and Refreshment Sunday |journal=Papers on Language and Literature |date=1972 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=199–201 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/950908498b6f12eb4101e772a0c0e480/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States celebrates Mother's Day on the second Sunday in May. In 1872 [[Julia Ward Howe]] called for women to join in support of disarmament and asked for 2 June 1872, to be established as a &quot;Mother's Day for Peace&quot;. Her 1870 &quot;Appeal to womanhood throughout the world&quot; is sometimes referred to as [[Mother's Day Proclamation]]. But Howe's day was not for honouring mothers but for organizing pacifist mothers against war. In the 1880s and 1890s there were several further attempts to establish an American &quot;Mother's Day&quot;, but these did not succeed beyond the local level.&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{Cite book|title=The family in America: an encyclopedia|chapter=Mother's Day|first=Virginia|last=Bernhard|editor=Joseph M.

&lt;!--The current [[Secular holiday|holiday]] was created by [[Anna Jarvis]] in [[Grafton, West Virginia]] in 1908 as a day to honour one's mother.&lt;ref name=vancouversun /&gt; Jarvis wanted to accomplish her mother's dream of making a celebration for all mothers, although the idea did not take off until she enlisted the services of wealthy Philadelphia merchant John Wanamaker, who celebrated it on 8 May 1910 in Bethany Temple Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, PA of which he was the founder. In a letter to the pastor, she said it was, &quot;our first Mother's Day&quot;.&lt;ref name=rouvalis&gt;Cristina Rouvalis, [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08132/880876-85.stm For the mother of Mother's Day, it's just never been right], Cristina Rouvalis, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis kept promoting the holiday until President Woodrow Wilson made the day an official national holiday in 1914.&lt;ref name=virginia /&gt;

The holiday eventually became so highly commercialized that many, including its founder, Anna Jarvis, considered it a &quot;[[Hallmark holiday]],&quot; ''i.e.'' one with an overwhelming commercial purpose. Jarvis eventually ended up opposing the holiday she had helped to create.&lt;ref name=vancouversun /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newcomer 135–136&quot;/&gt; This economic modernization was inspired by US models and was sponsored by the state.

Many worshippers celebrate the day with [[carnations]], coloured if the mother is living and white if she is dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Churchgoing&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Ellsworth Kalas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQpXwIt3ihAC&amp;q=%22third+only+to+Christmas+Eve+and+Easter%22&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Preaching the Calendar: Celebrating Holidays and Holy Days |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]]|quote=Church attendance on this day is likely to be third only to Christmas Eve and Easter.

Mother's Day continues to be one of the most commercially successful U.S. occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mother's Day Dining Fact Sheet | date = 28 April 2006 | publisher = [[National Restaurant Association]] | url = http://www.restaurant.org/Pressroom/Press-Releases/Mother-s-Day-Dining-Fact-Sheet | quote = Mother's Day is the most popular day of the year to dine out, with 38 percent of consumers reporting doing so | access-date = 29 December 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170627080205/http://www.restaurant.org/Pressroom/Press-Releases/Mother-s-Day-Dining-Fact-Sheet | archive-date = 27 June 2017 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the holiday would have withered over time without the support and continuous promotion of the florist industries and other commercial industries. Other Protestant holidays from the same time, such as [[Children's Day]] and [[Temperance Sunday]], do not have the same level of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, p.

'''Ukrainian''' ({{lang|uk|українська мова}} {{transl|uk|ukrayins'ka mova}} {{IPA-uk|ʊkrɐˈjinʲsʲkɐ ˈmɔwɐ|}}) is an [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]]. It is the [[official language|official state language]] of [[Ukraine]] and one of the three official languages in the [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized state]] of [[Transnistria]], the other two being [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the [[Cyrillic script]] (see [[Ukrainian alphabet]]).

Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the [[Old East Slavic]] of the early medieval state of [[Kyivan Rus']]. After the fall of the Kyivan Rus' as well as the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], the language developed into a form called the [[Ruthenian language]]. Along with Ruthenian, on the territory of modern Ukraine, the Kyiv version (izvod) of [[Church Slavonic]] was also used in liturgical services.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Hrebeniuk. ''[https://www.pravoslaviavolyni.org.ua/stattia/530-ptsu-i-tserkovnoslovianska-mova/ (ПЦУ і церковнослов’янська мова)]''. Volhynian diocese ([[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]]). 9 April 2019&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. From 1804 until the [[Russian Revolution]], the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the [[Russian Empire]], of which the [[Dnieper Ukraine|biggest part of Ukraine]] (Central, Eastern and Southern) was a part at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee/page/216 Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (p. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; It has always maintained a sufficient base in [[Western Ukraine]], where the language was never banned,&lt;ref name=&quot;WUkraineL&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AP2Hh3LVGaUC&amp;pg=PA309 Purism and Language: A Study in Modem Ukrainian and Belorussian Nationalism] by [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]], [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|087750-175-0}} (page 309)&lt;/ref&gt; in its folk songs, [[kobzar|itinerant musicians]], and prominent authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;WUkraineL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UkrGrammar30&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/contestedtongues00bila/page/76 Contested Tongues: Language Politics and Cultural Correction in Ukraine] by [[Laada Bilaniuk]], [[Cornell Univ.

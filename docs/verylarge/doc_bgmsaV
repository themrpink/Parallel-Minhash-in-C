De Gaulle described his adversarial relationship with Churchill in these words: &quot;When I am right, I get angry. Churchill gets angry when he is wrong.

After his initial support, Churchill, emboldened by American antipathy to the French general, urged his [[War Cabinet]] to remove de Gaulle as leader of the Free France. But the War Cabinet warned Churchill that a precipitate break with de Gaulle would have a disastrous effect on the whole resistance movement. By autumn 1943, Churchill had to acknowledge that de Gaulle had won the struggle for leadership of Free France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/06/world/churchill-and-roosevelt-wanted-de-gaulle-out-britain-discloses.html &quot;Churchill and Roosevelt Wanted de Gaulle Out, Britain Discloses&quot;], ''New York Times'', 6 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's relations with Washington were even more strained. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] for a long time refused to recognize de Gaulle as the representative of France, insisting on negotiations with the Vichy government. Roosevelt in particular hoped that it would be possible to wean Pétain away from Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War: Churchill V Roosevelt V De Gaulle|last=Berthon|first=Simo|date=4 June 2001|publisher=Collins|place=London|isbn=978-0-00-711622-5|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt maintained recognition of the Vichy regime until late 1942, and saw de Gaulle as an impudent representative of a minority interest.&lt;ref&gt;Julius W.

After 1942, Roosevelt championed General [[Henri Giraud]], more compliant with US interests than de Gaulle, as the leader of the Free France. At the [[Casablanca Conference]] (1943), Roosevelt forced de Gaulle to cooperate with Giraud, but de Gaulle was considered as the undisputed leader of the Resistance by the French people and Giraud was progressively deprived of his political and military roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QN9k6DW5uN0C&amp;pg=PA68|title=When Roosevelt Planned to Govern France|work=google.fr|isbn=978-1-55849-881-5|page=68|last1=Robertson|first1=Charles L.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British and Soviet governments urged Roosevelt to recognise [[French Committee of National Liberation|de Gaulle's provisional government]], but Roosevelt delayed doing so as long as possible and even recognised the Italian provisional government before the French one.

===Plane sabotage===
On 21 April 1943, de Gaulle was scheduled to fly in a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bomber]] to Scotland to inspect the [[Free French Navy]]. On take-off, the bomber's tail dropped, and the plane nearly crashed into the airfield's embankment. Only the skill of the pilot, who became aware of sabotage on takeoff, saved them. On inspection, it was found that aeroplane's separator rod had been sabotaged, using acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Picknett-Prince-Prior p. 301&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Picknett|Prince|Prior|2005| p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breuer p. 143-145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Breuer|2008|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secret Intelligence Service|Britain's MI6]] investigated the incident, but no one was ever apprehended. Publicly, blame for the incident was cast on German intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Charles de Gaulle World War II Database https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=68&lt;/ref&gt; however behind closed doors de Gaulle blamed the Western Allies, and later told colleagues that he no longer had confidence in them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breuer p. 143-145&quot;/&gt;

===Algiers===
[[File:Gen De Gaulle &amp; Catroux - North Africa.jpg|thumb|Generals de Gaulle and [[Georges Catroux|Catroux]], North Africa]]

Working with the [[French Resistance]] and other supporters in France's colonial African possessions after [[Operation Torch]] in November 1942, de Gaulle moved his headquarters to [[Algiers]] in May 1943, leaving Britain to be on French territory. He became first joint head (with the less resolutely independent General [[Henri Giraud]], the candidate preferred by the US who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet) and then—after squeezing out Giraud by force of personality—sole chairman of the [[French Committee of National Liberation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle was held in high regard by Allied commander General [[Dwight Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan298&quot;&gt;Keegan p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave de Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]] would be transferred from North Africa to the UK to carry out that liberation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan298&quot;/&gt; Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the [[Free French Forces]] and &quot;grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance&quot;; he also detected how strongly devoted many were to de Gaulle and how ready they were to accept him as the national leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan298&quot;/&gt;

===Preparations for D-Day===
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}
As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the US in particular found de Gaulle's tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome. Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as &quot;an apprentice dictator&quot;, a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]. Roosevelt directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; De Gaulle refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Simon (2000). The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography. Anchor; {{ISBN|0-385-49532-3}}. &lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few days before D-Day, Churchill, whose relationship with the General had deteriorated since he arrived in Britain, decided he needed to keep him informed of developments, and on 2 June he sent two passenger aircraft and his representative, [[Duff Cooper]], to Algiers to bring de Gaulle back to Britain. De Gaulle refused because of Roosevelt's intention to install a provisional Allied military government in the former occupied territories pending elections, but he eventually relented and flew to Britain the next day.

[[File:Winston Churchill with General de Gaulle during an inspection of French troops at Marrakesh in Morocco, January 1944. TR1505.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Winston Churchill with General de Gaulle during an inspection of French troops at Marrakesh in Morocco, January 1944. TR1505.jpg|thumb|left|Winston Churchill and General de Gaulle at [[Marrakesh]], January 1944]]
Upon his arrival at [[RAF Northolt]] on 4 June 1944 he received an official welcome, and a letter reading &quot;My dear general! Welcome to these shores, very great military events are about to take place!&quot;&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; Later, on his personal train, Churchill informed him that he wanted him to make a radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise his right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested he request a meeting with Roosevelt to improve his relationship with the president, de Gaulle became angry, demanding to know why he should &quot;lodge my candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt; the French government exists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

De Gaulle became worried that the German withdrawal from France might lead to a breakdown of law and order in the country and even a possible communist takeover.&lt;ref name=Beevor&gt;Beevor, Antony (2009) ''D-Day: The Battle for Normandy'', Penguin Group, {{ISBN|1101148721}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the general conversation which followed with those present, de Gaulle was involved in an angry exchange with the Labour minister, [[Ernest Bevin]], and, raising his concerns about the validity of the new currency to be circulated by the Allies after the liberation, de Gaulle commented scornfully, &quot;go and wage war with your false money&quot;. De Gaulle was very concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Churchill then lost his temper, saying that Britain would always be an ally to the United States, and that under the circumstances, if they had to choose between France and the US, Britain would always choose the latter. De Gaulle replied that he realised this would always be the case. The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation as the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France. It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a &quot;gangster&quot;. Churchill accused de Gaulle of treason in the height of battle, and demanded that he be flown back to Algiers &quot;in chains if necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;

De Gaulle and Churchill had a complex relationship during the wartime period. De Gaulle did show respect and admiration for Churchill, and even some light humorous interactions between the two have been noted by observers such as Duff Cooper, the British Ambassador to the French Committee of Liberation.&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/894-lion-of-britain-cross-of-lorraine-churchill-and-de-gaulle|title=Lion of Britain, Cross of Lorraine: Churchill and de Gaulle|publisher=winstonchurchill.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521023613/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/894-lion-of-britain-cross-of-lorraine-churchill-and-de-gaulle|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all|date=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill explained his support for de Gaulle during the darkest hours, calling him &quot;L'homme du destin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/take-a-frenchman-an-englishman-and-then/207280.article|title=Take a Frenchman, an Englishman and then...|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Casablanca in 1943, Churchill supported de Gaulle as the embodiment of a French Army that was otherwise defeated, stating that &quot;De Gaulle is the spirit of that Army. Perhaps the last survivor of a warrior race.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt; Churchill supported de Gaulle as he had been one of the first major French leaders to reject Nazi German rule outright, stating in August 1944 that &quot;I have never forgotten, and can never forget, that he [de Gaulle] stood forth as the first eminent Frenchman to face the common foe in what seemed to be the hour of ruin of his country and possibly, of ours.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt;

In the years to come, the sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly dependent wartime relationship of de Gaulle and his future political peers reenacted the historical national and colonial rivalry and lasting enmity between the French and the British,&lt;ref&gt;Bohlen, Avis (2007) {{cite web |url=http://www.europeaninstitute.org/Summer/Fall-2007/europes-most-influential-love-hate-relationship.html |title=Europe's Most Influential Love-Hate Relationship |accessdate=2010-12-28 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606230257/http://www.europeaninstitute.org/Summer/Fall-2007/europes-most-influential-love-hate-relationship.html |archivedate=6 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.

===Return to France===
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}
De Gaulle ignored ''les Anglo-Saxons'', and proclaimed the authority of [[Free France]] over the metropolitan territory the next day.{{when|date=December 2014}} Under the leadership of [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre de Tassigny]], France fielded an entire army – a joint force of Free French together with French colonial troops from North Africa – on the Western Front. Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and participated in the invasion and occupation of Germany. As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France.

[[File:HD-SN-99-02715.JPEG|thumb|left|General de Gaulle delivering a speech in liberated [[Cherbourg]] from the hôtel de ville (town hall)]]

On 14 June 1944, he left Britain for France for what was supposed to be a one-day trip. Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt; De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. The visit was 'devoid of trust on both sides' according to the French representative,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt; however, Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration.

Meanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Macksey&gt;Macksey, Kenneth (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 123. &quot;The Liberation of Paris&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation of the French capital was not high on the Allies' list of priorities as it had comparatively little strategic value, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the French 2nd Armored Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were still extremely concerned about a communist takeover. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], the commander of the garrison, was instructed by [[Adolf Hitler]] to raze the city to the ground, however, he simply ignored the order and surrendered his forces.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

It was fortunate for de Gaulle that the Germans had forcibly removed members of the Vichy government and taken them to Germany a few days earlier on 20 August; it allowed him to enter Paris as a liberator in the midst of the general euphoria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;&gt;Mondal, Jacques (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 72 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance, which had done so much to clear the way for the military, would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own 'Peoples' Government' in the capital. De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs-Élysées]], &quot;as much for prestige as for security&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else. In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital. Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor General [[Marie-Pierre Koenig]] as Governor of Paris.

As his procession came along the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and [[fifth column]]ists. Later, on entering the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] to be received as head of the provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but de Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked slowly down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the [[Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur|FFI]] and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported;

{{quote|... the General is being presented to the people. He is being received...they have opened fire! ... firing started all over the place ... that was one of the most dramatic scenes I have ever seen. ... General de Gaulle walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire ... but he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the centre aisle, even while the bullets were pouring about him. It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen ... there were bangs, flashes all about him, yet he seemed to have an absolutely charmed life.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'', 4 September 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in the great hall of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], de Gaulle was greeted by a jubilant crowd and, proclaiming the continuity of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], delivered a famous proclamation;

{{quote|Paris! Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the assistance of the armies of France, with the support and assistance of the whole of France! ... The enemy is faltering but he is not yet beaten. He is still on our soil. It will not suffice that we, with the assistance of our dear and admirable allies, will have chased him from our home in order to be satisfied after what has happened. We want to enter his territory, as is fitting, as conquerors. ... It is for this revenge, this vengeance and this justice, that we will continue to fight until the last day, until the day of the total and complete victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|title=Discours de l'Hôtel de Ville de Paris, 25 août 1944|publisher=charles-de-gaulle.org|accessdate=14 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127174456/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/accueil/discours/pendant-la-guerre-1940-1946/discours-de-l-hotel-de-ville-de-paris-25-aout-1944.php|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That evening, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later de Gaulle, still unsure of the trend of events asked General Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength. This he did 'not without some satisfaction',&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; and so, on 29 August, the US 28th Infantry Division was rerouted from its journey to the front line and paraded down the Champs Elysees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech made by General de Gaulle at the Hotel de Ville in Paris on August&amp;nbsp;25th 1944|publisher=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|year=2008|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=514|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141748/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=514|archivedate=16 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, Washington and London agreed to accept the position of the Free French. The following day General Eisenhower gave his de facto blessing with a visit to the General in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britain-recognizes-general-charles-de-gaulle-as-the-leader-of-the-free-french|title=Britain recognizes General Charles de Gaulle as the leader of the Free French|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1944–1946: Provisional Government of Liberated France==
Roosevelt insisted that an [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories]] (AMGOT) should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both the Secretary of War and the Under-Secretary for War, as well as by Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from the President on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. De Gaulle would later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Munholland, ''Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940–1945'', Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the prewar parties and most of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as [[Hotel de Matignon]] or the presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in his old office at the War Ministry. When he was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, they moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of [[Bois de Boulogne]] which had once been set aside for [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Werth&quot;&gt;De Gaulle. Alexander Werth (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions immediately after the liberation were even worse than under German rule. About 25% of the city was in ruins and public services and fuel were almost nonexistent. Large-scale public demonstrations erupted all over France, protesting the apparent lack of action at improving the supply of food, while in Normandy, bakeries were pillaged. The problem was not French agriculture, which had largely continued operating without problems, but the near-total breakdown of the country's infrastructure. Large areas of track had been destroyed by bombing, most modern equipment, rolling stock, lorries and farm animals had been taken to Germany and all the bridges over the [[Seine]], the [[Loire]] and the [[Rhone]] between Paris and the sea had been destroyed. The black market pushed real prices to four times the level of 1939, causing the government to print money to try to improve the money supply, which only added to inflation.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by de Gaulle and the two together were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] stated that [[Anthony Eden]] told him that &quot;not for one moment did Winston stop crying, and that he could have filled buckets by the time he received the Freedom of Paris.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt; He said &quot;they yelled for Churchill in a way that he has never heard any crowd yell before.&quot; At an official luncheon, de Gaulle said, &quot;It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if our old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world. There is no French man or woman who is not touched to the depths of their hearts and souls by this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;winstonchurchill.org&quot;/&gt;

===Curbing the Communist Resistance===
After the celebrations had died down, de Gaulle began conferring with leading Resistance figures who, with the Germans gone, intended to continue as a political and military force, and asked to be given a government building to serve as their headquarters. The Resistance, in which the Communists were competing with other trends for leadership, had developed its own manifesto for social and political change known as the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) Charter, and wanted special status to enter the army under their own flags, ranks and honours. Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the Resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and, that unless they joined the regular army, they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

Believing them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias. The communists were not only extremely active, but they received a level of popular support that disturbed de Gaulle. As early as May 1943, the US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him to take action to attempt to curb the rise of communism in France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

===Provisional Government of the French Republic===
{{Main|Provisional Government of the French Republic}}
On 10 September 1944 the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity formed. It included many of de Gaulle's Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialists]] and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister. The president of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second-ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government. While they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only Augustin Laurent and [[Charles Tillon]]—who as head of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] had been one of the most active members of the resistance—were given ministries. However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' by the French government for desertion. On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered.

There were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle's recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognized the need for unity and served as Commissioner for Economic Planning. Of equal rank to ministers and answerable only to the prime minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la République) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government. A number of former Free French associates served as commissioners, including [[Henri Fréville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debré]], who was charged with reforming the civil service. Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation. (Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but continued to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris massacre of 1961]], eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998.)

In social policy, legislation was introduced{{by whom|date=January 2016}} in February 1945 that provided for the establishment of works committees in all private industrial establishments employing more than 50 (originally more than 100) people.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Encyclopaedia new edition, Volume V: Edward-Franks, George Newnes Ltd. 1959, supplementary information 1961, printed and bound in England by Hazel Watson and Viney Ltd., Aylesbury and Slough.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tour of major cities===
De Gaulle's policy was to postpone elections as long as 2.6&amp;nbsp;million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]] he became irate when he had to sit next to former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquisard]] parades which preceded his speech.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

During the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin. Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering, together they would rise again. During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing ''La Marseillaise'', before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying &quot;Vive la France!&quot;&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

===Legal purges (Épuration légale)===
As the war entered the final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Perry, K. (1976) ''Modern European History'', W.H. Allen; {{ISBN|0750604824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of aiding, abetting, and taking German soldiers as lovers were subjected to public humiliations such as being shaved bald and paraded through the streets in their underwear. Women who got this treatment were lucky as many others were simply attacked by lynch mobs. With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4,500 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the chanteuse [[Édith Piaf]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[François de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[Épuration légale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt; Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and [[René Bousquet]]—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

Later, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France. Marshal Pétain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, Pétain received a death sentence which his old protégé de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted. Three Vichy leaders were executed. [[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945. [[Fernand de Brinon]], the third-ranking Vichy official, was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947. The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews, were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonized the court throughout with his bizarre behavior. He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval's execution was &quot;an indispensable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state&quot;. There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

===Winter of 1944===
The winter of 1944{{ndash}}45 was especially difficult for most of the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt; In some cases, unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. ''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

During this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies. The British ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at whatever possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt; De Gaulle believed Britain and the US were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over its overseas possessions and to prevent it from regaining its political and economic strength. In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

On Armistice Day in 1945, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau]]. The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle's wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared. De Gaulle had instructed that there be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement. When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, &quot;Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Visit to the Soviet Union===
With the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German-held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of eastern Europe. In fact, in October 1944, Churchill had agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robottom&quot;&gt;Robottom, John (1972) ''Modern Russia'', McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was to retain hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Soviet hands under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London.&lt;ref name=Robottom/&gt; De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the '[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]' Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

De Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt; He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944. In his memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to the Soviet Union, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Soviets, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eyewitness accounts.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

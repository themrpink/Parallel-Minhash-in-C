Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal found that thalidomide was a particularly effective [[antiemetic]] that had an inhibitory effect on [[morning sickness]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks ME, Macpherson GR, Figg WD | title = Thalidomide | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9423 | pages = 1802–11 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15172781 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16308-3 | s2cid = 208789946 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1259793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began marketing it under the trade name Contergan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grunenthal.com/about-us/history Grünenthal: Where we come from].

During this period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt; Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the [[placental barrier]] and harm the developing fetus,&lt;ref name=Chem1994&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Heaton CA | title = The Chemical Industry | publisher = Springer | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-7514-0018-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the [[Alcohol and pregnancy|effect of alcohol on fetal development]] had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Rouquette (1957) cited by {{cite journal | vauthors = Landesman-Dwyer S | title = Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome | journal = Applied Research in Mental Retardation | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–63 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7149705 | doi = 10.1016/0270-3092(82)90018-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There soon appeared reports of abnormalities in children being born to mothers using thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that [[peripheral neuritis]] developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelsey FO | title = Events after thalidomide | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 1201–5 | year = 1967 | pmid = 5235007 | doi = 10.1177/00220345670460061201 | s2cid = 11175347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for [[teratogenic]] deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public.&lt;ref name=&quot;50year&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Thalidomide: The Fifty Year Fight (no longer available) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLbhOyLLMY |access-date=13 September 2015 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany.{{citation needed |date=March 2017}} The regulatory authorities in [[East Germany]] did not approve thalidomide.&lt;ref name=&quot;oncozine.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first = Peter |last = Hofland |name-list-style = vanc |url = https://oncozine.com/reversal-of-fortune-how-a-vilified-drug-became-a-life-saving-agent-in-the-war-against-cancer/ |title = Reversal of Fortune: How a Vilified Drug Became a Life-saving Agent in the &quot;War&quot; Against Cancer |work = Onco'Zine |date = December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;VFA&quot;&gt;[http://www.vfa.de/de/arzneimittel-forschung/artikel-arzneimittel-forschung/teratogenitaet.html VFA: teratogenic effects] 6.

In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company [[The Distillers Company]] (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd (now part of [[Diageo plc]]), marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for [[morning sickness]] throughout the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that &quot;Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oncozine.com&quot;/&gt; Globally, more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid-1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under at least 37 different trade names.

In the US, representatives from Chemie Grünenthal approached [[Smith, Kline &amp; French]] (SKF), now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK), with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the FDA shows that, as part of its in-licensing approach, Smith, Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the US involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grünenthal to be &quot;sleep inducing&quot;, the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, Chemie Grünenthal, in 1958, reached an agreement with William S Merrell Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, ([[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|later Richardson-Merrell]], now part of [[Sanofi]]), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the US&lt;ref name=&quot;oncozine.com&quot;/&gt;

The US FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer [[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|Richardson-Merrell]] had applied for its approval in September 1960.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The official in charge of the FDA review, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the US. Oldham Kelsey was given a Presidential award for distinguished service from the federal government for not allowing thalidomide to be approved for sale in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | title = Report | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512235601/https://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | archive-date = 12 May 2009 | date = 12 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JF | title = Canadian Thalidomide Experience | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 89 | pages = 987–92 | date = November 1963 | pmid = 14076167 | pmc = 1921912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt; It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, Israeli physician [[Jacob Sheskin]] administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited [[Erythema nodosum|erythema nodosum leprosum]] (ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of [[leprosy]]. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silverman WA | title = The schizophrenic career of a &quot;monster drug&quot; | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 110 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 404–6 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12165600 | doi = 10.1542/peds.110.2.404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castilla EE, Ashton-Prolla P, Barreda-Mejia E, Brunoni D, Cavalcanti DP, Correa-Neto J, Delgadillo JL, Dutra MG, Felix T, Giraldo A, Juarez N, Lopez-Camelo JS, Nazer J, Orioli IM, Paz JE, Pessoto MA, Pina-Neto JM, Quadrelli R, Rittler M, Rueda S, Saltos M, Sánchez O, Schüler L | display-authors = 6 | title = Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America | journal = Teratology | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–7 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9098920 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199702)55:2&lt;156::AID-TERA6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests. Despite this, cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paumgartten FJ, Chahoud I | title = Thalidomide embryopathy cases in Brazil after 1965 | journal = Reproductive Toxicology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16427249 | doi = 10.1016/j.reprotox.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Correio | last = Braziliense | name-list-style = vanc | date = January 2006 | title = Talidomida volta a assustar | trans-title = Thalidomide again scare | language = pt | url = http://www.saude.df.gov.br/003/00301009.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=31041 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313095445/http://www.saude.df.gov.br/003/00301009.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=31041 | archive-date = 13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 100 cases identified in Brazil between 2005 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Brazil's new generation of Thalidomide babies | date = 23 July 2013 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23418102 | last = Crawford | first = Angus | name-list-style = vanc | newspaper = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5.8 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout Brazil in this time period, largely to poor Brazilians in areas with poor access to healthcare, and these cases have occurred despite the controls.

In 1998, the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-fda&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html | title = Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen | newspaper = New York Times | first = Sheryl Gay | last = Stolberg | name-list-style = vanc | access-date=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that [[Celgene Corporation]], which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name ''Thalomid'', establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-fda&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) stated that it did not recommend thalidomide for leprosy due to the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of [[clofazimine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy|last=Anon|work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |access-date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer treatment===
Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Kyle&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 2962–72 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18332230 | pmc = 2265446 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-10-078022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Kyle/&gt;

[[Judah Folkman]] pioneered studies into the role of [[angiogenesis]] (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that [[solid tumors]] could not expand without it.&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;{{cite web | first = Patricia K | last = Donahoe | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/folkman-judah.pdf | title = Judah Folkman: 1933–2008.

After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed [[multiple myeloma]] patients.&lt;ref name=Beilenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-thalidomide|publisher=National Cancer Institute|access-date=8 January 2012|title=FDA Approval for Thalidomide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also evaluated whether thalidomide can be combined with melphalan and prednisone for patients with multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs probably results in an increase of the overall survival &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piechotta V, Jakob T, Langer P, Monsef I, Scheid C, Estcourt LJ, Ocheni S, Theurich S, Kuhr K, Scheckel B, Adams A, Skoetz N | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide for first-line treatment in adults with transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma: a network meta-analysis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | issue = 11 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31765002 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD013487 | pmc = 6876545 | editor-last = Cochrane Haematology Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Birth defect crisis===

[[Image:NCP14053.jpg|thumb|Baby born to a mother who had taken thalidomide while pregnant]]
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities, such as [[phocomelia]], as a consequence of thalidomide use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bren&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Bren L | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer|publisher =U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =28 February 2001 | access-date =23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days gestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;50year&quot;/&gt;

The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Years: The Kefauver-Harris Amendments|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm320924.htm|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]]|access-date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (U.S.), [[Directive 65/65/EEC1]] (E.U.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thalidomide |url=http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |publisher=[[National Health Service (England)]] |access-date=6 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020225/http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medicines Act 1968]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conroy S, McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Unlicensed and off label drug use in neonates | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood.

=== Quality of life ===
In the 1960s, thalidomide was successfully marketed as a safer alternative to [[barbiturate]]s. Due to a successful marketing campaign, thalidomide was widely used by pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, thalidomide is a [[teratogenic]] substance, and a proportion of children born during the 1960s were afflicted with a syndrome known as thalidomide embryopathy (TE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadman e0210222&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbronner E, Glendinning C, Atkin K, Wadman R | title = The health and quality of life of Thalidomide survivors as they age - Evidence from a UK survey | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = e0210222 | date = 2019-01-16 | pmid = 30650111 | pmc = 6334953 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0210222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these babies born with TE, &quot;about 40% of them died before their first birthday&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;40 years later: the health related&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nippert I, Edler B, Schmidt-Herterich C | title = 40 years later: the health related quality of life of women affected by thalidomide | journal = Community Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 209–16 | date = 2002 | pmid = 14960874 | doi = 10.1159/000066691 | s2cid = 29641011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving individuals are now middle-aged and they report experiencing challenges (physical, psychological, and socioeconomic) related to TE.

Individuals born with TE frequently experience a wide variety of health problems secondary to their TE. These health conditions include both physical and psychological conditions. When compared to individuals of similar demographic profiles, those born with TE report less satisfaction with their quality of life and their overall health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadman e0210222&quot;/&gt; Access to health care services can also be a challenge for these people, and women in particular have experienced difficulty in locating healthcare professionals who can understand and embrace their needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;40 years later: the health related&quot;/&gt;

===Brand names===
Brand names include Contergan, Thalomid, Talidex, Talizer, Neurosedyn, Distaval and many others.

===Cost===
In the United Kingdom, it costs the [[NHS]] about £1,194 per month as of 2018.&lt;ref name=BNF76/&gt; This amount in the United States costs about US$9,236 as of 2019.&lt;ref name=Price2019/&gt;

==Research==
Research efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide.

===Thalidomide analogs===
{{Main|Development of analogs of thalidomide}}
The exploration of the [[antiangiogenic]] and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide [[Functional analog (chemistry)|analog]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10447943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah JH, Swartz GM, Papathanassiu AE, Treston AM, Fogler WE, Madsen JW, Green SJ | title = Synthesis and enantiomeric separation of 2-phthalimidino-glutaric acid analogues: potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 16 | pages = 3014–7 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10447943 | doi = 10.1021/jm990083y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11740816&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Amato RJ, Lentzsch S, Anderson KC, Rogers MS | title = Mechanism of action of thalidomide and 3-aminothalidomide in multiple myeloma | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 597–601 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11740816 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-7754(01)90031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as [[lenalidomide]], that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects&amp;nbsp;— except for greater [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao KV | title = Lenalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 1799–807 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17724360 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp070029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for [[lenalidomide]] (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, [[pomalidomide]], is now FDA approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=pomalidomide&amp;submit=Search |title=Search of: pomalidomide|publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[apremilast]] was approved by the FDA in March 2014.

It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent &lt;ref name=pmid11740816/&gt;  and also acts as an [[immunomodulator]].

===Clinical research===

A '''magnet''' is a material or object that produces a [[magnetic field]]. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other [[ferromagnetic material]]s, such as [[iron]], and attracts or repels other magnets. 

A '''permanent magnet''' is an object made from a material that is [[magnetize]]d and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a [[refrigerator magnet]] used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] (or [[ferrimagnetic]]). These include the elements [[iron]], [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]] and their alloys, some alloys of [[rare-earth element|rare-earth metals]], and some naturally occurring minerals such as [[lodestone]]. Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only ones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic, all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of [[magnetism]].

Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically &quot;soft&quot; materials like [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] [[iron]], which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized, and magnetically &quot;hard&quot; materials, which do. Permanent magnets are made from &quot;hard&quot; ferromagnetic materials such as [[alnico]] and [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture to align their internal [[Crystallite|microcrystalline]] structure, making them very hard to demagnetize. To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, and this threshold depends on [[coercivity]] of the respective material. &quot;Hard&quot; materials have high coercivity, whereas &quot;soft&quot; materials have low coercivity.  The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its [[magnetic moment]] or, alternatively, the total [[magnetic flux]] it produces. The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its [[magnetization]].

An [[electromagnet]] is made from a coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an [[electric current]] passes through it but stops being a magnet when the current stops.  Often, the coil is wrapped around a [[magnetic core|core]] of &quot;soft&quot; ferromagnetic material such as [[mild steel]], which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.

Ancient people learned about magnetism from [[lodestone]]s (or [[magnetite]]) which are naturally magnetized pieces of iron ore. The word ''[[:wikt:magnet|magnet]]'' was adopted in [[Middle English]] from [[Latin]] ''magnetum'' &quot;[[lodestone]]&quot;, ultimately from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μαγνῆτις [λίθος]}} (''magnētis [lithos]'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BkS2KW7u76MC ''Platonis Opera''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235807/https://books.google.com/books?id=BkS2KW7u76MC&amp;dq= |date=2018-01-14 }}, Meyer and Zeller, 1839, p. 989.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;[stone] from Magnesia&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The location of Magnesia is debated; it could be [[Ancient Magnesia|the region in mainland Greece]] or [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]].

{{Main|Magnetic field}}

The [[magnetic field|magnetic flux density]] (also called magnetic '''B''' field or just magnetic field, usually denoted '''B''') is a [[vector field]]. The magnetic '''B''' field [[Euclidean vector|vector]] at a given point in space is specified by two properties:

# Its ''direction'', which is along the orientation of a [[compass|compass needle]].
# Its ''magnitude'' (also called ''strength''), which is proportional to how strongly the compass needle orients along that direction.

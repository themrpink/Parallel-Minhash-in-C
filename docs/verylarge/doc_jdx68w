== Loop connectedness ==
The loop connectedness of a CFG is defined with respect to a given [[depth-first search]] tree (DFST) of the CFG. This DFST should be rooted at the start node and cover every node of the CFG.

Edges in the CFG which run from a node to one of its DFST ancestors (including itself) are called back edges.

The loop connectedness is the largest number of back edges found in any cycle-free path of the CFG. In a reducible CFG, the loop connectedness is independent of the DFST chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kam|first=John B.|last2=Ullman|first2=Jeffrey D.|date=1976-01-01|title=Global Data Flow Analysis and Iterative Algorithms|journal=Journal of the ACM|volume=23|issue=1|pages=158–171|doi=10.1145/321921.321938|issn=0004-5411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.umb.edu/~offner/files/flow_graph.pdf|title=Notes on Graph Algorithms Used in Optimizing Compilers|last=Offner|first=Carl|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Niklaus Chodowiecki''' (16 October 1726 – 7 February 1801) was a [[Germany|German]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Chodowiecki-Daniel;3885657.html Chodowiecki Daniel - Encyklopedia PWN]&lt;/ref&gt; painter and [[printmaker]] with Huguenot and Polish ancestry, who is most famous as an [[Etching|etcher]]. He spent most of his life in [[Berlin]], and became the director of the [[Berlin Academy of Art]].

==Family==
He was born in the city of [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) in [[Poland]], and in a letter “in typical Berlin humor”{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} wrote, “that he moved to Berlin, Germany, which shows for sure, that he is a 'genuine Pole'.”{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} He kept close to the [[Huguenot]] scene, due to his ancestry. 

His grandfather Bartholomāus Chodowiecki had lived in the 16th century in [[Greater Poland]]. Gottfried Chodowiecki, Daniel's father, was a tradesman in Danzig and his mother, Henriette Ayrer born in [[Switzerland]], was a Huguenot. Daniel's grandfather Christian had been a tradesman in the city as well. When his father died, both Daniel (aged 16) and his younger brother Gottfried Chodowiecki went to live with their uncle in Berlin, who offered to educate them, and where Daniel received an artistic training with the painter Haid in [[Augsburg]]. His brother also became a painter.

{{anchor|Jeannette Papin}}
He had three daughters, [[Jeannette Papin|Jeannette]] (b. 1761, married the French-reformed preacher Jacques Papin), [[Suzanne Chodowiecka|Suzanne]] (1763&amp;ndash;1819) and Henriette (1770&amp;ndash;1880). Jeannette's daughter Marianne Chodowiecka Papin (married Gretschel, 1794&amp;ndash;1870) and her son Heinrich Papin (1786&amp;ndash;1839) also became artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/people/detail.php?ID=8227|title=Jeannette Papin (German, 1761 – 1835) – The Athenaeum|website=www.the-athenaeum.org|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chodowiecki Raubdruck 1781.jpg|thumb|300px|Cartoon [[etching]] by Chodowiecki, 1781, on the [[Partition of Poland]]]]
Soon Daniel was able to earn a living by painting. He was admitted to the Berlin Academy in 1764 and became vice-director under [[Bernhard Rode]] in 1788. He had found his true calling and became the most famous German graphic artist of his time. His works includes several thousand [[etching]]s, usually rather small, and many drawings and paintings. His book illustrations embrace almost all the great classics. His prints represent in great detail the life of the bourgeoisie during the ''Zopfstil'' period, a time between [[Rococo]] and [[Classicism]]. In 1797 Chodowiecki was appointed director of the Academy of Arts in Berlin, where he died on 7 February 1801. The bulk of his work was in illustrating scientific books by [[Johann Bernhard Basedow|Basedow]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Lavater]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and others. He also painted many portraits of Polish gentry and was interested in Huguenot and Polish history as well, making some paintings on the topic. 
He was in tune with the developing spirit of the age, and many works reflect the cult of [[sensibility]], and then the revolutionary and German [[nationalism|nationalist]] feelings of the end of the centu 

In [[printmaking]], he is credited with the invention of the deliberate ''remarque'', a small sketch on a plate, lying outside the main image.  These were originally little sketches or doodles by artists, not really meant to be seen, but Chodowiecki turned them into &quot;bonus items&quot; for collectors.

Chodowiecki, though speaking only French and German&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Boockmann, Ostpreussen und Westpreussen, Siedler 2002, {{ISBN|3-88680-212-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (due to his offices in the Huguenot French community in Berlin he often spoke French), many times also declared his Polish allegiance and had his son Isaac Heinrich, born in Berlin, painted as a very young child with a Polish outfit and haircut. After [[Partitions of Poland]] Chodowiecki wrote to Gräfin Solms-Laubach: &quot;From father's side I'm Polish, a descendant of a brave nation which will soon vanish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Charlotte Steinbrücker: Listy D. Chodowieckiego. Berlin, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Józef Łęcki]], the Polish astronomer, he wrote: ''&quot;I consider it an honour to be a genuine Pole, even though I am now living in Germany&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Because of his mother's and his wife's Huguenot descent he was very close to the Huguenots of Berlin. Nearly all his life and career was spent in Germany, writing in German and living in Berlin from the age of almost 17.

One of his most popular books is &quot;Journey from Berlin to Danzig&quot; ({{lang-de|&quot;Die Reise von Berlin nach Danzig&quot;}}, 1773) with many illustrations. He purchased a horse rather than going by stage coach. This was his first return after 30 years absence and he went specifically to see his elderly mother and sisters in Danzig again. He made only one more trip to Danzig afterwards, to his mother's funeral. He describes and illustrates towns and people in Pomerania and Prussia on the way.

Chodowiecki is buried at the ''Französischer Friedhof'' cemetery in Berlin.

A short animation entitled &quot;Chodowiecki&quot;, based on Chodowiecki's life and work, was produced in 2020 by Polish director [[Jakub Paczek]]. All the scenes in the film were composed of animated Chodowiecki's graphics, which were digitized, processed and animated for this sole purpose.

In [[music]], a '''cadenza''' (from {{lang-it|cadenza|link=no}} {{IPA-it|kaˈdɛntsa|}}, meaning [[cadence]]; plural, ''cadenze'' {{IPA-it|kaˈdɛntse|}}) is, generically, an [[improvisation|improvised]] or written-out [[ornament (music)|ornamental]] [[passage (music)|passage]] played or sung by a [[solo (music)|soloist]] or soloists, usually in a &quot;free&quot; [[rhythm]]ic style, and often allowing [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] display. During this time the [[accompaniment]] will rest, or sustain a note or chord. Thus an improvised cadenza is indicated in written notation by a [[fermata]] in all parts. A cadenza will usually occur over the final or penultimate note in a piece, the lead-in ({{lang-de|Eingang|link=no}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keefe|first=Simon P.|author-link=Simon P. Keefe|title=The Cambridge Companion to Mozart|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page=265|isbn=9781139826648}}&lt;/ref&gt; or over the final or penultimate note in an important subsection of a piece. It can also be found before a final [[coda (music)|coda]] or [[ritornello]].{{sfn|Randel|2003}}

==In concerti==
The term ''cadenza'' often refers to a portion of a [[concerto]] in which the [[orchestra]] stops playing, leaving the soloist to play alone in [[free time (music)|free time]] (without a strict, regular pulse) and can be written or improvised, depending on what the composer specifies. Sometimes, the cadenza will include small parts for other instruments besides the soloist; an example is in [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], where a solo flute, clarinet and horn are used over rippling arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza normally occurs near the end of the first movement, though it can be at any point in a [[concerto]]. An example is [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|First Piano Concerto]], where in the first five minutes a cadenza is used.  The cadenza is usually the most elaborate and virtuosic part that the solo instrument plays during the whole piece. At the end of the cadenza, the orchestra re-enters, and generally finishes off the movement on their own, or, less often, with the solo instrument.

==As a vocal flourish==
The cadenza was originally, and remains, a vocal flourish improvised by a performer to elaborate a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] in an [[aria]]. It was later used in instrumental music, and soon became a standard part of the concerto. Cadenzas for voice and wind instruments were to be performed in one breath, and they should not use distant [[key (music)|keys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agricola|first=Johann Friedrich|author-link=Johann Friedrich Agricola|title=Introduction to the Art of Singing|translator=[[Julianne Baird|Julianne C. Baird]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=211|isbn=9780521454285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was improvised in this context as well, but during the 19th century, [[composer]]s began to write cadenzas out in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|last=Latham|first=Alison|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780198662129|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/194 194]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third parties also wrote cadenzas for works in which it was intended by the composer to be improvised, so the soloist could have a well formed solo that they could practice in advance. Some of these have become so widely played and sung that they are effectively part of the standard repertoire, as is the case with [[Joseph Joachim]]'s cadenza for [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s set of cadenzas for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto no. 20]], and [[Estelle Liebling]]'s edition of cadenzas for operas such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti's]]'s ''[[La fille du régiment]]'' and ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.

==In jazz==
Perhaps the most notable deviations from this tendency towards written (or absent) cadenzas are to be found in [[jazz]], most often at the end of a [[ballad (music)|ballad]], though cadenzas in this genre are usually brief. Saxophonist [[John Coltrane]], however, usually improvised an extended cadenza when performing &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot;, in which he showcased his predilections for scalar improvisation and [[multiphonic]]s. The recorded examples of &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot; (''[[Live at Birdland (John Coltrane album)|Live at Birdland]]'' and ''[[Afro Blue Impressions]]'') are approximately 8 minutes in length, with Coltrane's unaccompanied cadenza taking up approximately 3 minutes. More sardonically, jazz critic [[Martin Williams (writer)|Martin Williams]] once described Coltrane's improvisations on &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; as &quot;essentially extended cadenzas to pieces that never get played.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reitzes.com/coltrane1.html |title=A Love Supreme: God Breathes Through John Coltrane |author=Reitzes, David |year=1998 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally noteworthy is saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]]' shorter improvised cadenza at the close of &quot;Three Little Words&quot; (''[[Sonny Rollins on Impulse!]]'').

Cadenzas are also found in instrumental solos with piano or other accompaniment, where they are placed near the beginning or near the end or sometimes in both places (e.g. &quot;The Maid of the Mist,&quot; cornet solo by [[Herbert L. Clarke]], or a more modern example: the end of &quot;Think of Me&quot;, where Christine Daaé sings a short but involved cadenza, in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'').

==Notable examples==

{{Refimprove section|date = October 2012}}

*Concertos are not the only pieces that feature cadenzas; ''Scena di Canta Gitano'', the fourth movement of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Capriccio Espagnol]]'', contains cadenzas for [[French horn|horns]] and [[trumpet]]s, [[violin]], [[Western concert flute|flute]], [[clarinet]], and [[harp]] in its beginning section.
*[[Johann Strauss II]] unusually wrote a cadenza-like solo for cello and flute for the final section of his ''[[Kaiser-Walzer|Emperor Waltz]]'', before a round of trumpets and then the whole orchestra bring the piece to its end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=Heinrich Eduard|author-link=Heinrich Eduard Jacob|title=Johann Strauss – A Century of Light Music|publisher=Hutchinson|page=294|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The second movement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Brandenburg Concertos#No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048|third Brandenburg Concerto]] consists of just two chords; it is generally taken to indicate a cadenza to be improvised around that [[cadence (music)|cadence]].
*The first movement of Bach's [[Brandenburg Concerto No. 5|fifth Brandenburg Concerto]] features an extensive written cadenza for harpsichord.
*The coloratura arias of [[bel canto]] composers [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], and [[Gioachino Rossini]].
*Mozart wrote the cadenzas for violin and viola duet in the first and second movements of the [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|''Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola, and Orchestra'', K. 364]].
*Mozart wrote a cadenza into the third and final movement of [[Piano Sonata No. 13 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata in B-flat major, K. 333]], which was an unusual (but not unique) choice at that time because the movement is otherwise in [[Sonata rondo form|sonata-rondo form]].
*[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|&quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto]] contains a notated cadenza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove&quot;/&gt; It begins with a cadenza that is partly accompanied by the orchestra. Later in the first movement, the composer specifies that the soloist should play the music that is written out in the score, and not add a cadenza on one's own.
* Beethoven famously included a cadenza-like solo for [[oboe]] in the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section of the first movement of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]].
*[[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|first piano concerto]] is notable not only for having a cadenza within the first few minutes of the first movement, but also for having a ''second'' – substantially longer – cadenza in a more conventional place, near the end of the movement.
*[[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], in which the first movement features a long and incredibly difficult [[toccata]]-like cadenza with an even longer alternative or [[ossia]] cadenza written in a heavier chordal style. Both cadenzas lead to an identical section with arpeggios in the piano and a solo flute accompanying, before the cadenza ends quietly.
*[[Fritz Kreisler]]'s cadenzas for the first and third movements of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]].
* [[Aaron Copland]] uses a cadenza in his [[Clarinet Concerto (Copland)|Clarinet Concerto]] to connect the two movements.
*[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed five ensemble cadenzas in his wind quintet ''[[Zeitmaße]]'' (1955–56),&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Kohl, ''Karlheinz Stockhausen: Zeitmaße'', Landmarks in Music Since 1950, edited by Wyndham Thomas (Abingdon, Oxon; London; New York: Routledge, 2017): 89–121. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5334-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; cadenzas for piccolo trumpet and piccolo in ''[[Samstag aus Licht#Scene 3: Luzifers Tanz|Luzifers Tanz]]'' (1983), and a cadenza for cor anglais in his trio ''[[Klang (Stockhausen)#Seventh Hour: Balance|Balance]]'' (2007)
* [[Karol Szymanowski]]'s two violin concertos both feature cadenzas written by the violinist who was intended to play them, [[Paweł Kochański]].
* In the third movement of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|Violin Concerto]], there is an unexpected cadenza in which the orchestra supports the solo with a pizzicato tremolando effect (&quot;cadenza accompagnato&quot;).
* [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2]] for piano contains the instruction ''cadenza [[ad libitum]]'' before the final coda, meaning it is at the pianist's discretion that such a cadenza is added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove&quot;/&gt; Whilst most performers prefer to decline the invitation, some pianists such as [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Marc-André Hamelin]] have produced notable cadenzas for the work.
* Pianists [[Chick Corea]] and [[Makoto Ozone]] incorporated jazz cadenzas into an otherwise traditional performance in Japan of the [[Piano Concerto No. 10 (Mozart)|Mozart Double Piano Concerto]].
* [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]] features numerous cadenzas for violin.
* Mozart wrote a cadenza in his own [[Horn Concerto No. 3 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 3]], towards the end of the first of three movements.
* [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)|second piano concerto]] contains a taxing five-minute cadenza that closes out the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)#Andantino-Allegretto|first movement]].
* In [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|first cello concerto]] the third movement on its own is a cadenza connecting the second and fourth movements.
* [[Carlos Chávez]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Chávez)|Violin Concerto]] has a seven-minute unaccompanied cadenza as the third of its five main sections, despite the fact that the soloist plays almost without a break throughout the rest of the 35-minute-long composition

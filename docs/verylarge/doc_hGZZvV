==Productions==
[[File:Pinaforeplaybill.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Poster illustration from original 1878 production]]
''Pinafore'' opened on 25 May 1878 at the [[Opera Comique]], before an enthusiastic audience, with Sullivan conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|After opening night, the company's musical director, Alfred Cellier, conducted most of the performances. [[Eugène Goossens, père|Eugène Goossens]] conducted the piece in late July and August 1878, while Cellier was assisting Sullivan at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theatres&quot;, ''The Era'', 21 July 1878, p. 8; 28 July 1878, p. 8; and 4 August 1878, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie. [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/004.html &quot;The Life and Reminiscences of Jessie Bond&quot;, Chapter 4], John Lane, 1930, accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley116&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves in the summer of 1878 were short and transient.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show.&lt;ref name=Jacobs122/&gt; In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices.&lt;ref name=Jacobs122&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 July 1878, p. 1 announced that Eugène Goossens would conduct.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 1878, Sullivan used some of the ''Pinafore'' music, arranged by his assistant [[Hamilton Clarke]], during several successful promenade concerts at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; By September, ''Pinafore'' was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique. The piano score sold 10,000&amp;nbsp;copies,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the financial resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of the Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present ''Pinafore'' for the duration of the initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/pinafore/reviews/op_com1878-80/era790209.html &quot;Opera Comique&quot;]. ''The Era'', 9 February 1879, reprinted at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when ''Pinafore'' resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.&lt;ref name=Stedman170&gt;Stedman, p. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 165–67 and 194–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous versions of ''Pinafore'', unauthorised by its creators, began playing in America with great success, beginning with a production in [[Boston]] that opened on 25 November 1878.&lt;ref name=Bradley116/&gt; ''Pinafore'' became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the exchange:

[[File:PinFirstNightProg.jpg|right|thumb|Opening night programme cover]]
In February 1879, ''Pinafore'' resumed operations at the Opera Comique.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The opera also resumed touring in April, with two companies crisscrossing the British provinces by June, one starring [[Richard Mansfield]] as Sir Joseph, the other [[W. S. Penley]] in the role. Hoping to join in on the profits to be made in America from ''Pinafore'', Carte left in June for New York to make arrangements for an &quot;authentic&quot; production there to be rehearsed personally by the author and composer. He arranged to rent a theatre and auditioned chorus members for the American production of ''Pinafore'' and a new Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be premiered in New York, and for tours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ainger169&quot;/&gt;

Sullivan, as had been arranged with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce ''Pinafore'' with them and that he would be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July.&lt;ref name=Ainger169&gt;Ainger, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 89: Sullivan wrote to [[John Hollingshead]], saying: &quot;You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the ''Merry Wives of Windsor''&amp;nbsp;... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over.&amp;nbsp;...' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' also at once. I am detaining the parts of ''Pinafore'', so that the directors shall not take them away from the [[Opera Comique|Comique]] tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent ''you'' set.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play ''Pinafore'' at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of ''Pinafore'' more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Aeneas Joseph Dymott, accepted.&lt;ref name=Rollins6/&gt; They engaged the [[Imperial Theatre, London|Imperial Theatre]] but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt; Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although the stage manager, [[Richard Barker (stage manager)|Richard Barker]], and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted &quot;Fire!&quot; George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html &quot;The Fracas at the Opera Comique&quot;], ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

After his return to London, Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Pinafore'' continued to play strongly.

===Taking ''Pinafore'' to the United States===
Approximately 150&amp;nbsp;unauthorised productions of ''Pinafore'' sprang up in the [[United States]] in 1878 and 1879, and none of these paid royalties to the authors.  Gilbert and Sullivan called them &quot;pirated&quot;, although the creators did not have any international copyright protection.&lt;ref name=Prestige&gt;Prestige, Colin. &quot;D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates: The Original New York Productions of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot;, pp. 113–48 at p. 118, ''Gilbert and Sullivan [http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/handle/1808/5875 Papers Presented at the International Conference] held at the [[University of Kansas]] in May 1970'', Edited by James Helyar.

[[File:HMSPinafore2.png|thumb|left|Advertisement for a (probably unlicensed) American production of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'']]
These unauthorised performances took many forms, including [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], productions with men playing women's roles and vice versa, spoofs, variety acts, [[Minstrel show]] versions,&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; all-black and Catholic productions, German, [[Yiddish]] and other foreign-language versions,&lt;ref name=Jones7&gt;Jones, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; performances on boats or by church choirs,&lt;ref name=Stedman169&gt;Stedman, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and productions starring casts of children.&lt;ref name=Bradley116/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; Few purported to play the opera as written.{{refn|James C.

They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after ''Pinafore'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', by giving the official premiere in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Zvi S.

Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of ''Pinafore'' in America.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager [[John T. Ford]]{{refn|Ford had been one of the few managers who had paid Gilbert and Sullivan any kind of fee for performing ''Pinafore'' in America, and his reward for a small gesture was great.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} to present, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], the first authorised American production of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref name=Ainger169/&gt; In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including [[J. H. Ryley]] as Sir Joseph, [[Blanche Roosevelt]] as Josephine, [[Alice Barnett]] as Little Buttercup, [[Furneaux Cook]] as Dick Deadeye, [[Hugh Talbot]] as Ralph Rackstraw and [[Jessie Bond]] as Cousin Hebe.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129&gt;Jacobs, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; To these, he added some American singers, including [[Signor Brocolini]] as Captain Corcoran.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Cellier]] came to assist Sullivan, while his brother [[François Cellier|François]] remained in London to conduct ''Pinafore'' there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pinafore'' opened in New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of ''Pinafore''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, ''The Pirates of Penzance'', which premiered with much success on 31 December.&lt;ref name=Jacobs129/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing ''Pinafore'' alongside ''Pirates''.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stedman175&gt;Stedman, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's production===
[[File:Grattanpin.jpg|thumb|1880 programme for Carte's ''Children's Pinafore'']]
The unauthorised juvenile productions of ''Pinafore'' were so popular that Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Kanthor, Hal.

Carte's children's production earned enthusiastic reviews from the critic [[Clement Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Clement. [http://savoyoperas.org.uk/pinafore/childpin.html &quot;Our Play-Box.

He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning&amp;nbsp;...

===Subsequent productions===
After the opera became successful in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as many as three, played ''Pinafore'' under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 7–164&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pin15 1.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Ruth Vincent]] as Josephine in 1899]]
Until 1908, revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress, with ladies' costumes executed by couture houses such as [[Redfern (couture)|Redfern]].&lt;ref name=rw&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p.

The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not allow any other professional company to present the Savoy operas in Britain until the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so, beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=copyright&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/gondoliers/doc_67/67docprod.html l &quot;The 1968 D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Production of ''The Gondoliers''&quot;], reprinted from theatre programme of 29 January 1968, ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', Retrieved on 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After 1961, other professional companies mounted productions of the opera in Britain.

==Reception==

===Initial critical reception===
The early reviews were mostly favourable.&lt;ref name=Allenfn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stedman161/&gt; ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Seldom indeed have we been in the company of a more joyous audience.&amp;nbsp;... [Gilbert and Sullivan] have on previous occasions been productive of such legitimate amusement, such novel forms of drollery, such original wit, and unexpected whimsicality, that nothing was more natural than for the audience to anticipate an evening of thorough enjoyment. The expectation was fulfilled completely. Those who believed in the power of Mr Gilbert to tickle the fancy with quaint suggestions and unexpected forms of humour were more than satisfied, and those who appreciate Mr Arthur Sullivan's inexhaustible gift of melody were equally gratified; while that large class of playgoers who are pleased with brilliant dresses and charming stage effects declared themselves delighted. The result, therefore, was &quot;a hit, a palpable hit&quot;&amp;nbsp;... there were some slight drawbacks [such] as the severe cold that affected Mr. Rutland Barrington [the captain], and almost prevented his singing.}}

''The Era'' also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Era'', 2 June 1878, Country Edition, 40(2071): p. 5, cols. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Entr'acte and Limelight'' commented that the opera was reminiscent of ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Sorcerer'' but found it diverting and called the music &quot;very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics, is funny&quot;.&lt;ref name=Limelight&gt;&quot;London Theatres. Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Entr'acte and Limelight: Theatrical and Musical Critic and Advertiser'', 1 June 1878, 466: p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trovatore&gt;''Pinafore'' parodies the baby-switching plot device in ''[[Il Trovatore]]''. See, e.g., Gurewitsch, Matthew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/24/arts/music-there-will-always-be-a-trovatore.html?pagewanted=all &quot;There Will Always Be a ''Trovatore''&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 24 December 2000, accessed 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph, noting with amusement that he was made up to look like portraits of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], &quot;and his good introductory song seems levelled at&quot; [[William Henry Smith (1825–1891)|W. H. Smith]]. It opined, further, that &quot;He Is an Englishman&quot; is &quot;an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English&quot;. It found the piece, as a whole, well presented and predicted that it would have a long run.&lt;ref name=Limelight/&gt;

[[File:Punch - Sullivan's knighthood.png|right|thumb|''Punch'' cartoon mocking Sullivan for his focus on comic opera]]
Similarly, ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' concluded that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's &quot;caustic humour and quaint satire&quot;. It found that there was &quot;much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits.&amp;nbsp;... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expression&amp;nbsp;... The piece is well performed throughout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opera Comique&quot;, ''The Illustrated London News'', 1 June 1878, 72(2031): 515&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', ''The Globe'', ''[[The Times]]'' (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'' concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, &quot;adds to the reality of the illusion&quot;.&lt;ref name=Allenfn/&gt; ''The Times'' also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a &quot;national musical stage&quot; with a libretto free from risqué French &quot;improprieties&quot; and without the &quot;aid&quot; of Italian and German musical models.&lt;ref name=Timesrev&gt;''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', however, greeted the opera with only mixed praise.&lt;ref name=Stedman161/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walbrook&gt;Walbrook, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Musical Times]]'' complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was &quot;detrimental to the art-progress of either&quot; because, although it was popular with audiences, &quot;something higher is demanded for what is understood as 'comic opera'&quot;. The paper commented that Sullivan had &quot;the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition&quot;. It concluded, however, by saying how much it enjoyed the opera: &quot;Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opera-Comique&quot;, ''The Musical Times'', 1 June 1878, 19(424): 329&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' and several of the other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art. Only ''The Figaro'' was actively hostile to the new piece.&lt;ref name=Allenfn/&gt; Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by ''The Academy'' joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for ''Pinafore'' and hoped that he would turn to projects &quot;more worthy of his great ability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Academy'', 13 July 1878, new series 14(323): p. 49, col. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The many unauthorised American productions of 1878–79 were of widely varying quality, and many of them were adaptations of the opera. One of the more &quot;authentic&quot; ones was the production by the [[Boston Ideal Opera Company]], which was first formed to produce ''Pinafore''. It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an &quot;ideal&quot; production. The ''Boston Journal'' reported that the audience was &quot;wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval&quot;. The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider ''Pinafore'' a burlesque, &quot;for while irresistibly comical it is not ''bouffe'' and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost&quot;.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; The ''Journal'' described the opera as &quot;classical&quot; in method and wrote that its &quot;most exquisite satire&quot; lay in its &quot;imitation of the absurdities&quot; of grand opera. The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' wrote that &quot;the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight&amp;nbsp;... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard&quot;.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;

===Subsequent reception===
When ''Pinafore'' was first revived in London in 1887, it was already treated as a classic. ''The Illustrated London News'' observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue, jokes and songs, but concluded that this was for the best, as the public would have missed the &quot;time-honoured jokes, such as 'Hardly Ever.' The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Playhouses&quot;, ''The Illustrated London News'', 19 November 1887, 91(2535): 580, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Theatre'' concurred, stating that since the opera &quot;has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere, there is not much occasion to descant&quot;. It called the revival a &quot;most brilliant&quot; success and predicted another long run.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Our Omnibus-Box&quot;, ''The Theatre'', New Series, 1 December 1887, 10: 337&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BarringtonCaptain.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rutland Barrington]] as Captain Corcoran in the first London revival, 1887]]
Reviewing the 1899 revival, ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's critique of Sullivan. On the one hand, &quot;The ''Pinafore''&amp;nbsp;... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character&amp;nbsp;... it is delicately scored, and in many ways displays ability of a high order&quot;. On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his [[Symphony in E, Irish|symphony]], &quot;he would have produced still higher results; in like manner ''Pinafore'' set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Athenæum'', 10 June 1899, 3737: 730–731&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote: &quot;No other comic opera ever written – no other stage play, indeed, of any sort – was ever so popular.&amp;nbsp;... ''Pinafore''&amp;nbsp;... has been given, and with great success, wherever there are theaters – from Moscow to [[Buenos Aires]], from [[Cape Town]] to [[Shanghai]]; in [[Madrid]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Melbourne]]; even in Paris, Rome, [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. [http://gsarchive.net/pinafore/html/pinafore_by_mencken.html &quot;Pinafore at 33&quot;], ''[[Baltimore Evening Sun]]'', 1911, reproduced at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Gilbert and Sullivan, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] retained exclusive rights to perform their operas in Great Britain until 1962, touring throughout Britain for most of the year and, beginning in 1919, often performing in London for a season of about four months. ''The Times'' gave the company's 1920 London production an enthusiastic review, saying that the audience was &quot;enraptured&quot;, and regretting that ''Pinafore'' would be played for only two weeks. It praised the cast, singling out [[Leo Sheffield]] as the Captain, [[Henry Lytton]] as Sir Joseph, [[Elsie Griffin]] as Josephine, James Hay as Ralph, [[Bertha Lewis]] as Little Buttercup and the &quot;splendid&quot; choral tone. It concluded that the opera made a &quot;rollicking climax to the season&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''H.M.S. Pinafore''. Revival at [[Princes Theatre]]&quot;, ''The Times'', 21 January 1920, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, it gave an even more glowing report of that season's performances, calling [[Derek Oldham]] an &quot;ideal hero&quot; as Ralph, noting that [[Sydney Granville]] &quot;fairly brought down the house&quot; with his song, that [[Darrell Fancourt]]'s Deadeye was &quot;an admirably sustained piece of caricature&quot; and that it was a &quot;great pleasure&quot; to hear the returning principals.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''H.M.S. Pinafore''. Sullivan Opera Season Nearing The End&quot;, ''The Times'', 3 January 1922, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A 1961 review of the company's ''Pinafore'' is much the same.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Novelty and Tradition in Savoy Operettas&quot;, ''The Times'', 12 December 1961, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, [[J. C. Williamson]] acquired the exclusive performing rights to ''Pinafore'' in Australia and New Zealand. His first production earned public and critical acclaim. Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, [[Maggie Moore]] played Josephine. Praising the production and all the performers, the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' noted that the production though &quot;abounding in fun&quot; was dignified and precise, that many numbers were encored and that laughter and applause from the &quot;immense audience&amp;nbsp;... was liberally bestowed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 17 November 1879&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson's company continued to produce ''Pinafore'' in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success. As Williamson said, &quot;If you need money, then put on G&amp;S&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Pinafore'' continued to garner praise outside Britain. The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen, for example, was revived repeatedly, playing for well over 100&amp;nbsp;performances to &quot;packed houses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;H.M.S. Pinafore Again Delights the Danes&quot;, ''The Times'', 16 October 1959, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as [[Samarkand]] in Uzbekistan have been successful.&lt;ref name=Brad4&gt;Bradley (2005), Chapter 4, describing numerous productions beginning with 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan's performance copyright was never in force,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A New Approach to ''H.M.S. Pinafore''&quot;, ''The Times'', 9 March 1960, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pinafore'' continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies. ''The New York Times'', in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat [[New York Hippodrome]] a &quot;royal entertainment [that] comes up smiling&quot;. The opera had been turned into a &quot;mammoth spectacle&quot; with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour. Buttercup made her entrance by rowing over to the three-masted ''Pinafore'', and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash. The ''Times'' praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs to be &quot;shouted&quot;. The production took some liberties, including interpolated music from other Sullivan works. The paper concluded, &quot;the mild satire of ''Pinafore'' is entertaining because it is universal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''H.M.S. Pinafore'' a la Hippodrome; They Sail the Ocean Tank and Their Saucy Ship's a Beauty&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 10 April 1914, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The same newspaper deemed [[Winthrop Ames]]' popular Broadway productions of ''Pinafore'' in the 1920s and 1930s &quot;spectacular&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brooks Atkinson|Atkinson, J. Brooks]], &quot;G. &amp; S., Incorporated&quot;, ''The New York Times'', 25 April 1926, p. X1&lt;/ref&gt; Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received. ''The New York Times'' review of [[The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players]]' 2008 season at [[New York City Center]] commented, &quot;Gilbert's themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated. But the lasting appeal of ''Pinafore'' and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan's generous supply of addictive melodies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve.

With the expiry of the copyrights, companies around the world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. Productions of ''Pinafore'', both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful [[Essgee Entertainment]] (formed by [[Simon Gallaher]]) in Australia and [[Opera della Luna]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=Brad4/&gt; Since its original production, ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas.&lt;ref name=Bradley117&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sobelsohn, David.

Hundreds of productions of ''Pinafore'' are presented every year worldwide.&lt;ref name=Brad4/&gt;

==Analysis==
Theatre historian [[John Bush Jones]] wrote that ''Pinafore'' has &quot;everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [and] has a score that&amp;nbsp;... has plenty of tunes for the audience to go away humming&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jones8&gt;Jones, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that the secret of the success of the Savoy operas is the way in which &quot;Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Original Rackstraw&quot;, ''The Era'', 18 July 1908, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on &quot;mirth and silliness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635159512/Pinafore-focuses-on-mirth-and-silliness.html?pg=all &quot;''Pinafore'' focuses on mirth and silliness&quot;], ''Deseret News'', 10 November 2005, accessed 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a [[pinafore]], to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like ''[[HMS Victory|Victory]]'', ''[[HMS Goliath|Goliath]]'', ''[[HMS Audacious|Audacious]]'' and ''[[HMS Minotaur|Minotaur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benford, Harry. ''The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Lexicon'', Third Edition, p. 39, Houston: Queensbury Press (1999) {{ISBN|0-9667916-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satiric and comic themes===
Gilbert's biographer Jane Stedman wrote that ''Pinafore'' is &quot;satirically far more complex&quot; than ''The Sorcerer''. She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from &quot;Captain Reece&quot; (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from &quot;General John&quot; (1867). Dick Deadeye, based on a character in &quot;Woman's Gratitude&quot; (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding &quot;face and form&quot; makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense.&lt;ref name=Stedman161/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew. &quot;Hunchbacks, Misanthropes and Outsiders: Gilbert's Self-Image&quot;, ''Gilbert and Sullivan Boys and Girls'' (GASBAG) no. 206 (Winter 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' which includes the device of baby-switching.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PinaforeCups1.jpg|left|thumb|Souvenir programme cover from 1878 during the run of the original production]]
Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that ''Pinafore'' &quot;satirizes the type of nautical drama of which [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'' is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or nothing to help one's country&quot;.&lt;ref name=Walbrook/&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton]] agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of &quot;being proud of yourself for being a citizen&quot; of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the &quot;temptations to belong to other nations&quot; but is merely an excuse for pride.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterton, G. K., introduction to Godwin, Augustine Henry. ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan: A Critical Appreciation of the Savoy Operas'', E.P. Dutton &amp; Co (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, &quot;they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military&amp;nbsp;... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole [[jingoism]] that is the British Empire.&quot;&lt;ref name=MusicShow&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/musicshow/stories/2005/1378819.htm Interview of Stuart Maunder],  ''The Music Show'', [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Radio National, Australia, 14 May 2005, accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: &quot;''H.M.S.

One of Gilbert's favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility. In ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position. In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty.{{refn|Stedman, pp. 106–10; &quot;My dear, it's one of the beautiful principles of our system of government never to appoint anybody to any post to which he is at all fitted.  Our government offices are as so many elementary schools for the instruction of ministers.  To take a minister who knows his duties, and to send him to an elementary school to learn them, is an obvious waste of educational power.  Nature has pointed you out as eminently qualified for First Lord of the Admiralty, because you don't know anything about ships. You take office – you learn all about ships – and when you know all about ships, the opposition comes in, out you go, and somebody else who doesn't know anything about ships comes in and takes your place.  That's how we educate our ministers.&quot;|group= n}}&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, pp. 166–67&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pinafore'', Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by &quot;never go[ing] to sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=Walbrook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischler, Alan. ''Modified Rapture: comedy in W. S. Gilbert's Savoy operas'', pp. 91–92, Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley in ''Pirates'', and Ko-Ko in ''[[The Mikado]]'', are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications. Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph &quot;always voted at [his] party's call&quot;, he sacrificed his personal integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;commercial middle class&quot; (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed.&lt;ref name=T1929&gt;&quot;Savoy Theatre: The Sullivan Opera Season, ''H.M.S. Pinafore''&quot;, ''The Times'', 10 December 1929, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''.&lt;ref name=Stedman160/&gt; ''The Times'' wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that ''Pinafore'' was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a &quot;paternal&quot; Captain and the &quot;ethics&amp;nbsp;... of all romanticism&quot; are accepted &quot;unflinchingly&quot; and taken to their logical conclusion: &quot;It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out&quot;.&lt;ref name=T1929/&gt;

[[File:Circa-1879-DOyly-Carte-HMS-Pinafore-from-Library-of-Congress2.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre poster for an American production, c.&amp;nbsp;1879]]
A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks. In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ''The Sorcerer'', a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different [[social class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pinafore'', the captain's daughter, Josephine, loves and is loved by a common sailor, but she dutifully tells him, &quot;your proffered love I haughtily reject&quot;. He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with &quot;I am a British sailor, and I love you&quot;. It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she. This is a parody of the Victorian &quot;equality&quot; drama, such as [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'' (1838), where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech, ending with &quot;I am a peasant!&quot;&lt;ref name=Stedman162&gt;Stedman, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; It then turns out that he has become her social superior. Furthermore, in ''Pinafore'', Sir Joseph assures Josephine that &quot;love levels all ranks&quot;. In [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''The Serf'', the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank, and she declares happily at the end that &quot;love levels all&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stedman162/&gt; In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical [[melodrama]], Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are &quot;any man's equal&quot; (excepting his), and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor. Conversely, he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him &quot;dance a hornpipe on the cabin table&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stedman162/&gt; Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine &quot;becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of Buttercup's inadvertent switching of the infants&quot; and concludes that Gilbert is a &quot;conservative satirist [who] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo&amp;nbsp;... [and] set out to show [that] love definitely ''does not'' level all ranks&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jones8/&gt;

There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is, as Jones argues, a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest &quot;against the follies of his age&quot;.&lt;ref name=Land&gt;Crowther, Andrew. &quot;The Land Where Contradictions Meet&quot;, ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 2, no. 11, pp. 325–31, Autumn 2000 (discussing the views of various scholars)&lt;/ref&gt; The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert's &quot;techniques of inversion – with irony and topsyturvydom&quot;, which lead to &quot;the surface meaning of his writings&quot; being &quot;the opposite of their underlying meaning&quot;. Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to &quot;celebrate&quot; society's norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions. In ''Pinafore'', which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that &quot;also had tremendous appeal to the general public&quot;.&lt;ref name=Land/&gt; He creates &quot;a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama&amp;nbsp;... [though] controlled by the conventions it mocks&quot;.&lt;ref name=Land/&gt; While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in ''Pinafore'' Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself.{{refn|Crowther notes that Alexis in ''The Sorcerer'' is also such a &quot;misguided superior&quot;. See also Stedman, p. 162.|group= n}} The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain's daughter, throwing over the accepted &quot;fabric of social order&quot;. At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert's satiric argument should result in Ralph's arrest. But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies. By an &quot;accident of birth&quot;, Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once.&lt;ref&gt;See also Jones, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Crowther concludes, &quot;We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule.&quot; Thus, ''Pinafore'' found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the &quot;existing social order&quot; and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.&lt;ref name=Land/&gt;

===Songs and musical analysis===
According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot &quot;admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jacobs118&gt;Jacobs, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan embraces the nautical setting; in &quot;We Sail the Ocean Blue&quot;, for example, he &quot;presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCGuide/&gt; In the Captain's opening song, &quot;I am the Captain of the Pinafore&quot;, he admits that his gentlemanliness &quot;never&amp;nbsp;... well, hardly ever&quot; gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he &quot;hardly ever&quot; suffers from seasickness.&lt;ref name=BBCGuide&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A620993 &quot;'HMS Pinafore' – the Comic Opera&quot;], Edited Guide Entry from ''The Lives and Works of Gilbert and Sullivan'', BBC h2g2, 24 August 2001, accessed 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan &quot;unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase 'What never?'&amp;nbsp;... cunningly sharpened&amp;nbsp;... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jacobs119&gt;Jacobs, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Audrey Williamson argued that the music of ''Pinafore'' is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score, from the &quot;glee&quot; for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to &quot;For He Is an Englishman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had introduced this character in his 1870 Bab Ballad &quot;The Bumboat Woman's Story&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;A British tar&quot; (a [[glee (music)|glee]] for three men describing the ideal sailor), composed by Sir Joseph &quot;to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man's equal, excepting mine&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jacobs118/&gt; Sullivan's voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the &quot;equality&quot; plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph.&lt;ref name=Land/&gt; Another popular number is Sir Joseph's song &quot;When I was a Lad&quot;, recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of [[William Henry Smith (1825–1891)|W. H. Smith]], the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877.&lt;ref name=Walbrook/&gt;

In ''Pinafore'', Sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect, for instance in &quot;Kind Captain, I've important information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in &quot;Sorry her lot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The musicologist Gervase Hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes &quot;a rousing nautical tune&amp;nbsp;... in a key of no nonsense, C major&amp;nbsp;... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of &quot;Sorry her lot&quot; in 2/4 [time]. After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup&amp;nbsp;... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz.&quot; He continues, &quot;the bassoon and basses&amp;nbsp;... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore&amp;nbsp;... in the improbable key of A flat minor.&amp;nbsp;... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a [[Cadential six four|good old 6/4]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jacobs, &quot;Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their interactive music (particularly 'Never mind the why and wherefore'), and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama, Little Buttercup with 'gypsy blood in her veins' and the heavy-treading Dick Deadeye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, ''quoted'' in Holden, p. 1060&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs also opined that the [[Leading-tone|leading tone]] that begins &quot;Never mind the why and wherefore&quot; &quot;serves to emphasize the phrase like a [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss-ian]] grace-note&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jacobs118/&gt; The Sullivan scholar [[David Russell Hulme]] noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, &quot;particularly the [[Handel]]ian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hulme, ''quoted'' in Sadie, vol. 2, p. 727&lt;/ref&gt; Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from [[Franz Schubert]]'s &quot;[[Der Erlkönig|The Erl-King]]&quot; and also parodies the opera ''[[Il Trovatore]]''.&lt;ref name=Trovatore/&gt; Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in &quot;[[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizettian]] recitative&quot;. But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by &quot;subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jacobs119/&gt;

==Revisions and cut material==

===Ballad for Captain Corcoran, &quot;Reflect, my child&quot;===
During rehearsals for the original production, Gilbert added a ballad for Captain Corcoran in which he urged his daughter to forget the common sailor with whom she is in love, because &quot;at every step, he would commit solecisms that society would never pardon.&quot; The ballad was meant to be sung between No. 5 and No. 6 of the current score, but it was cut before opening night. The words survive in the libretto that was deposited with the [[Lord Chamberlain]] for licensing. Before 1999, all that was known to survive of Sullivan's setting was a copy of the leader violin part.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;Perry, Helga J.

In April 1999, Sullivan scholars Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry announced that they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts. These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Bruce.

===Dialogue for Cousin Hebe===
In the licensing copy of the libretto, Sir Joseph's cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II. In the scene that follows No. 14 (&quot;Things are seldom what they seem&quot;), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord's dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet, eliciting the response &quot;Crushed again!&quot; Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''. Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 (&quot;Carefully on tiptoe stealing&quot;) and again after No. 19 (&quot;Farewell, my own&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd and Walters, pp. 751–52 and p. 754; and [http://www.gsarchive.net/pinafore/html/hebe.htm Hebe's cut dialogue after Nos. 14 and 19], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=critical&gt;Young, Percy M.

Late in rehearsals for the original production, Jessie Bond assumed the role of Hebe, replacing [[Mrs Howard Paul]]. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd and Walters, pp. 596–99&lt;/ref&gt; Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

'''Bernardo Bertolucci''' ({{IPA-it|berˈnardo bertoˈluttʃi|lang}}; 16 March 1941 – 26 November 2018) was an Italian director and screenwriter, whose films include ''[[The Conformist (1970 film)|The Conformist]]'', ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'', ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]), ''[[The Sheltering Sky (film)|The Sheltering Sky]]'', ''[[Little Buddha]]'', ''[[Stealing Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]].''

In recognition of his work, he was presented with the inaugural Honorary [[Palme d'Or]] Award at the opening ceremony of the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernardo Bertolucci to receive Palme d'Or honour|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13041286|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|access-date=25 August 2012|author=BBC News|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979 until his death in 2018, he was married to screenwriter [[Clare Peploe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Philip|title=The Triumph of Clare Peploe|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-triumph-of-clare-peploe/|access-date=29 June 2015|work=Movie Maker|date=3 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730150949/http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/the-triumph-of-clare-peploe/|archive-date=30 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Bertolucci was born in the Italian city of [[Parma]], in the region of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. He was the elder son of Ninetta (Giovanardi), a teacher, and [[Attilio Bertolucci]], who was a poet, a reputed art historian, anthologist and film critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Bernardo-Bertolucci.html |title=Bernardo Bertolucci Biography (1940-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was born in Australia, to an Italian father and an Irish mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bernardo Bertolucci: Interviews|author1=Bertolucci, B.|author2=Gerard, F.S.|author3=Kline, T.J.|author4=Sklarew, B.H.|date=2000|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781578062058|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXjyHVUD-GcC&amp;pg=PR17|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;corriere&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=BERTOLUCCI+Bernardo|publisher=cinquantamila.corriere.it|title=Bernardo Bertolucci - biografia|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been raised in an artistic environment, Bertolucci began writing at the age of fifteen, and soon after received several prestigious literary prizes including the ''Premio Viareggio'' for his first book. His father's background helped his career: the elder Bertolucci had helped the Italian filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] publish his first novel, and Pasolini reciprocated by hiring Bertolucci as first assistant in Rome on ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961).

Bertolucci had one brother, the theatre director and playwright [[Giuseppe Bertolucci|Giuseppe]] (27 February 1947 – 16 June 2012). His cousin was the film producer Giovanni Bertolucci (24 June 1940 – 17 February 2005), with whom he worked on a number of films.

== Career ==
=== Directorial breakthrough ===
Bertolucci initially wished to become a poet like his father. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A YOUNG BERTOLUCCI TALKS ABOUT PASOLINI (from &quot;Pasolini l'Enragé&quot;)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0D8nuI1iE|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|access-date=25 August 2012|author=theblackpaul|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Bertolucci left the University without graduating. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called ''[[La commare secca]]'' (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute's homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed ''[[Before the Revolution]]'' (''Prima della rivoluzione'', 1964).

The boom of [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], which gave Bertolucci his start, slowed in the 1970s as directors were forced to co-produce their films with several of the American, Swedish, French, and German companies and actors due to the effects of the global economic recession on the Italian film industry.

Bertolucci caused controversy in 1972 with the film ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], [[Jean-Pierre Léaud]] and [[Massimo Girotti]]. The film presents Brando's character, Paul, as he copes with his wife's suicide by emotionally and physically dominating a young woman, Jeane (Schneider). The depictions of Schneider, then 19 years old, were regarded as exploitative. In one scene, Paul anally rapes Jeane using butter as a lubricant. The use of butter was not in the script; Bertolucci and Brando had discussed it, but they did not tell Schneider. She said in 2007 that she had cried &quot;real tears&quot; during the scene and had felt humiliated and &quot;a little raped&quot;.&lt;ref name=Izadi5Dec2016&gt;Izadi, Elahe (5 December 2016).

Following the scandal surrounding the film's release, Schneider became a drug addict and suicidal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLellan|first1=Dennis|title=Maria Schneider dies at 58; actress in 'Last Tango in Paris'|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/04/local/la-me-maria-schneider-20110204|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=24 March 2015|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal proceedings were brought against Bertolucci in Italy for the rape scene; the film was sequestered by the censorship commission and all copies were ordered destroyed. An Italian court revoked Bertolucci's [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] for five years and gave him a four-month [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernardo Bertolucci |url=http://www.rannakino.ee/en/programm/july-2012.html?id=348 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213033410/http://www.rannakino.ee/en/programm/july-2012.html?id=348 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |work=Rannakino |publisher=Rannakino |access-date=26 August 2012 |author=Rannakino |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the Appeals Court of [[Bologna, Italy|Bologna]] ordered three copies of the film to be preserved in the national film library with the stipulation that they could not be viewed, until Bertolucci was later able to re-submit it for general distribution with no cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rashkin|first1=Esther|title=Unspeakable Secrets and the Psychoanalysis of Culture|date=2008|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany, New York|isbn=978-0791475348|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuQmXl2j9cgC&amp;pg=PA223|access-date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/last-tango-in-paris-director-says-maria-schneider-butter-scene-not-consensual|title=Last Tango in Paris director suggests Maria Schneider 'butter rape' scene not consensual|first1=Bonnie|last1=Malkin|last2=agencies|date=3 December 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-reacts-disgust-outrage-last-tango-paris-directors-resurfaced-rape-scene-confession-95|title=Hollywood Reacts With Disgust, Outrage Over 'Last Tango in Paris' Director's Resurfaced Rape Scene Confession}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-consensual-bernardo-bertolucci-1201933117/|title='Last Tango in Paris' Rape Scene Was Not Consensual, Director Bernardo Bertolucci Admits|first=Seth|last=Kelley|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertolucci increased his fame with his next few films, from ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' (1976), an epic depiction of the struggles of farmers in [[Emilia-Romagna]] from the beginning of the 20th century up to [[World War II]] with an international cast ([[Robert De Niro]], [[Gérard Depardieu]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Dominique Sanda]]) to ''[[La Luna (1979 film)|La Luna]]'', set in [[Rome]] and in [[Emilia-Romagna]], in which Bertolucci deals with the thorny issue of drugs and [[incest]], and finally ''[[Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man|La tragedia di un uomo ridicolo]]'' (1981), with [[Ugo Tognazzi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man: A Kidnaping as Seen by Bertolucci |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=12 February 1982 |work=The New York Times |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E5DA103BF931A25751C0A964948260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then wrote two screenplays based on [[Dashiell Hammett]]’s [[Red Harvest]]. He hoped this would be his first film set in America, but nothing came of it.&lt;ref name=guardobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/26/bernardo-bertolucci-obituary|title=Bernardo Bertolucci obituary |work=The Guardian|date=26 November 2018|access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Last Emperor'' and later career ===
In 1987, Bertolucci directed the epic ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', a biographical film telling the life story of [[Aisin-Gioro]] [[Puyi]], the [[Qing Dynasty|last Emperor of China]]. The film was independently produced by British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], with whom Bertolucci worked almost exclusively from then on. The film was independently financed and three years in the making. Bertolucci, who co-wrote the film with [[Mark Peploe]], won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. The film uses Puyi's life as a mirror that reflects China's passage from [[feudalism]] through revolution to its current state.

At the [[60th Academy Awards]], ''The Last Emperor'' [[List of films receiving six or more Academy Awards|won all nine Oscars]] for which it was nominated: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].&lt;ref name=nyt88&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/12/movies/the-last-emperor-wins-9-oscars-and-is-named-best-film-of-1987.html|title='The Last Emperor' Wins 9 Oscars And Is Named Best Film of 1987|work=The New York Times|date=12 April 1988|access-date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Last Emperor'' was the first feature film ever authorized by the government of the People's Republic of China to film in the [[Forbidden City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,967235,00.html Love And Respect, Hollywood-Style], an April 1988 article by [[Richard Corliss]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertolucci had proposed the film to the Chinese government as one of two possible projects. The other film was ''[[La Condition Humaine]]'' by [[André Malraux]]. The Chinese government preferred ''The Last Emperor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-06/entertainment/ca-26851_1_bernardo-bertolucci|title=Bertolucci: The Emperor's New Clothier|work=Los Angeles Times|date=6 December 1987|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Last Emperor'', ''[[The Sheltering Sky (film)|The Sheltering Sky]]'' and ''[[Little Buddha]]'', Bertolucci returned to Italy to film, and to revisit his old themes but with varying results from both critics and the public. He filmed ''[[Stealing Beauty]]'' in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/liv-tyler-stealing-beauty-summer-movie|title=Why Stealing Beauty Is the Ultimate Summer Movie|work=Vogue|access-date=12 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'' in 2003, which describes the political passions and sexual revolutions of two siblings in Paris in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1141606,00.html|title=The Dreamers|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|date=6 December 2004|access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bertolucci received the Golden Lion Award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for his life's work, and in 2011 he also received the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinematografo.it/news/speciale-palma-doro-a-bertolucci/ |title=Speciale Palma d'Oro a Bertolucci |publisher=Cinematografo.it |access-date=2 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, his final film, ''[[Me and You (film)|Me and You]]'' was screened out of competition at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |access-date=26 May 2012 |work=Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latinamericanfilm&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/22/me-and-you-review?newsfeed=true |title=Cannes 2012: Me and You (Io e Te) – review |access-date=26 May 2012 |work=Latin American Film |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released early in 2013 in the UK. The film is an adaptation of [[Niccolò Ammaniti]]'s young-adult's book ''[[Me and You (novel)|Me and You]]''. The screenplay for the movie was written by Bertolucci himself, Umberto Contarello and Niccolò Ammaniti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bernardo Bertolucci girerà il suo prossimo film in 3D |first=Nicoletta |last=Gemmi |date=18 February 2011 |url=http://www.primissima.it/cinema_news/scheda/bernardo_bertolucci_girera_il_suo_prossimo_film_in_3d/ |access-date=1 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126135138/http://www.primissima.it/cinema_news/scheda/bernardo_bertolucci_girera_il_suo_prossimo_film_in_3d/ |archive-date=26 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertolucci originally intended to shoot the film in [[3D film|3D]] but was forced to abandon this plan due to cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|title=Bertolucci abandons 3D plan for 'Me and You'|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118044104?refcatid=19|access-date=21 April 2012|work=Variety|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertolucci appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio Four]] programme [[Start the Week]] on 22 April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s09js|title=Start the week|date=22 April 2013|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]] on 29 April 2013, where he chose ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', a film directed by [[Federico Fellini]], for the &quot;Cultural Exchange&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02p38dh|title=Cultural Exchange|date=29 April 2013|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2018, in an interview with the Italian edition of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)#International editions|Vanity Fair]], Bertolucci announced that he was preparing a new film.  He stated, &quot;The theme will be love, let's call it that. In reality, the theme is communication and therefore also incommunicability. The favorite subject of [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and the condition I found myself facing when I moved on from my films for the few, those of the sixties, to a broader cinema ready to meet a large audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=vanit2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.it/show/cinema/2018/11/26/addio-a-bernardo-bertolucci-morto-roma-regista|title=Addio a Bernardo Bertolucci. L'ultima intervista|date=November 2018|access-date=30 November 2018|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a screenwriter, producer and actor ===
Bertolucci wrote many screenplays, both for his own films and for films directed by others, two of which he also produced.

He was an actor in the film ''[[Golem, the Spirit of the Exile|Golem: The Spirit of Exile]]'', directed by [[Amos Gitai]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kviff.com/en/programme/film/03154-golem-the-spirit-of-exile/|title= Archive of films Golem: The Spirit of Exile / Golem: L'esprit de l'exil |publisher=Karlovy Vary International Film Festival|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and personal beliefs ==
Bertolucci was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymovies.it/critica/persone/critica.asp?id=37880&amp;r=3121 |title=Interview to Mymovies |publisher=Mymovies.it |access-date=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertolucci's films are often very political. He was a professed [[Marxist]] and, like [[Luchino Visconti]], who similarly employed many foreign artists during the late 1960s, Bertolucci used his films to express his political views; hence they are often autobiographical as well as highly controversial. His political films were preceded by others re-evaluating history. ''[[The Conformist (1970 film)|The Conformist]]'' (1970) criticised [[Fascist]] ideology, touched upon the relationship between nationhood and nationalism, as well as issues of popular taste and collective memory, all amid an international plot by [[Benito Mussolini]] to assassinate a politically active [[left-wing politics|leftist]] professor of philosophy in Paris. ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' also analyses the struggle of Left and Right.

On 27 September 2009, Bertolucci was one of the signatories of the appeal to the Swiss government to release [[Roman Polanski]], who was being held awaiting extradition to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Andre Soares|date=30 September 2009|title=Penelope Cruz, Bernardo Bertolucci, Gael Garcia Bernal Sign Polanski Petition|publisher=Alt Film Guide|access-date=31 August 2013|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/politics/penelope-cruz-bertolucci-bernal-polanski-petition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Twitter]] on 24 April 2015, Bertolucci participated in #whomademyclothes, Fashion Revolution's anti-[[sweatshop]] campaign commemorating the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Revolution: who made your clothes?|url=http://www.mindfood.com/article/fashion-revolution-who-made-your-clothes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertolucci advocated the practice of Transcendental Meditation: &quot;We want to evoke the present and it is difficult to do it all together, we can only meditate , as in transcendental meditation. One of the most powerful experiences. Either you meditate or watch a good movie, then the two things start to touch ... &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sguardidiconfine.com/bertolucci-addio-sguardo-eclettico-sulla-realta/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Bertolucci died of [[lung cancer]] in [[Rome]] on 26 November 2018, at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/cinema/2018/11/26/news/e_morto_bernardo_bertolucci-212656049/ |title=È morto Bernardo Bertolucci, l'ultimo grande maestro |newspaper=[[La Repubblica]] |date=26 November 2018 |access-date=26 November 2018 |first=Irene |last=Bignardi |publisher=Divisione Stampa Nazionale |agency=[[GEDI Gruppo Editoriale]] S.p.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46342644 |title=Oscar-winning director Bertolucci dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=26 November 2018 |access-date=27 November 2018 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bernardo-bertolucci-dead-oscar-winning-italian-director-was-77-1163744 |title=Bernardo Bertolucci, Oscar-Winning Italian Director of 'The Last Emperor,' Dies at 77 |first=Georg |last=Szalai |date=26 November 2018 |access-date=27 November 2018 |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2e1a502-f311-11e8-938a-543765795f99|title=Bernardo Bertolucci, film director, 1941-2018|work=Financial Times|author=Nigel Andrews|date=29 November 2018|access-date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

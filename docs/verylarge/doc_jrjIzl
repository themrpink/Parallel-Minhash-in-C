The [[limnology]] of the lake shows it contains approximately 280 million tons of dissolved salts, with the [[salinity]] varying depending upon the amount of water in the lake at any given time. Before 1941, average salinity was approximately 50&amp;nbsp;grams per liter (g/l) (compared to a value of 31.5 g/l for the world's oceans). In January 1982, when the lake reached its lowest level of {{convert|6372|ft|m|0}}, the salinity had nearly doubled to 99 g/l. In 2002, it was measured at 78 g/l and is expected to stabilize at an average 69 g/l as the lake replenishes over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlcfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake FAQ|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/faq|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615160759/http://monolake.org/about/faq|archive-date=2010-06-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unintended consequence of ending the water diversions was the onset of a period of [[Meromictic|&quot;meromixis&quot;]] in Mono Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jellison|first=R.|author2=J.

In meromictic lakes, the deeper waters do not undergo this mixing; the deeper layers are more saline than the water near the surface, and are typically nearly devoid of oxygen. As a result, becoming meromictic greatly changes a lake's ecology.

Mono Lake has experienced meromictic periods in the past; this most recent episode of meromixis, brought on by the end of the water diversions, commenced in 1994 and had ended by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Jellison|first1=R.|last2=Roll|first2=S.|date=June 2003|url=http://www.monolake.uga.edu/public/files/Mono_Lake_Mixing.pdf|title=Weakening and near-breakdown of meromixis in Mono Lake|via=monolake.uga.edu|accessdate=2008-11-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030045630/http://www.monolake.uga.edu/public/files/Mono_Lake_Mixing.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole food chain of the lake is based on the high population of single-celled [[plankton]]ic [[algae]] present in the [[photic zone]] of the lake. These algae reproduce rapidly during winter and early spring after winter runoff brings nutrients to the surface layer of water. By March the lake is &quot;as green as pea soup&quot; with photosynthesizing algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake|work=Ecoscenario|url=http://www.fossweb.com/CA/modules3-6/Environments/activities/mono/content_old.html|accessdate=2007-01-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115927/http://www.fossweb.com/CA/modules3-6/Environments/activities/mono/content_old.html|archivedate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is famous for the Mono Lake brine shrimp, ''[[Artemia monica]]'', a tiny species of [[brine shrimp]], no bigger than a thumbnail, that are [[endemic]] to the lake. During the warmer summer months, an estimated 4–6 trillion brine shrimp inhabit the lake. Brine shrimp have no food value for humans, but are a staple for birds of the region. The brine shrimp feed on microscopic algae.

Alkali flies, ''[[Ephydra hians]]'' live along the shores of the lake and walk underwater, encased in small air bubbles for grazing and to lay eggs. These flies are an important source of food for migratory and nesting birds.

8 [[Nematode]] species were found living in the littoral sediment:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shih|first1=Pei-Yin|last2=Lee|first2=James Siho|last3=Shinya|first3=Ryoji|last4=Kanzaki|first4=Natsumi|last5=Pires-daSilva|first5=Andre|last6=Badroos|first6=Jean Marie|last7=Goetz|first7=Elizabeth|last8=Sapir|first8=Amir|last9=Sternberg|first9=Paul W.|date=2019-09-26|title=Newly Identified Nematodes from Mono Lake Exhibit Extreme Arsenic Resistance|journal=Current Biology|language=en|volume=29|issue=19|pages=3339–3344.e4|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2019.08.024|pmid=31564490|s2cid=202794288|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/98870/2/1-s2.0-S0960982219310401-mmc1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
[[File:Mono Lake South Tufa Area (2013) 33.JPG|thumb|right|A female [[Audubon's warbler]] on tufa in the &quot;South Tufa&quot; area]]
Mono Lake is a vital resting and eating stop for migratory [[wader|shorebirds]] and has been recognized as a site of international importance by the [[Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake|work=Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network|url=http://www.whsrn.org/site-profile/mono-lake|accessdate=2011-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231259/http://www.whsrn.org/site-profile/mono-lake|archive-date=2011-07-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nearly 2,000,000 [[waterbird]]s, including 35 [[species]] of shorebirds, use Mono Lake to rest and eat for at least part of the year. Some shorebirds that depend on the resources of Mono Lake include [[American avocet]]s, [[killdeer]] and [[sandpiper]]s. Over 1.5 million [[black-necked grebe|eared grebes]] and [[phalarope]]s use Mono Lake during their long migrations.

Late every summer tens of thousands of [[Wilson's phalarope]]s and [[red-necked phalarope]]s arrive from their nesting grounds, and feed until they continue their migration to [[South America]] or the tropical oceans respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlcbirds&quot;/&gt;

In addition to migratory birds, a few species spend several months to nest at Mono Lake. Mono Lake has the second largest nesting population of [[California gull]]s, ''Larus californicus'', second only to the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah. Since abandoning the landbridged Negit Island in the late 1970s, California gulls have moved to some nearby islets and have established new, if less protected, nesting sites. [[Cornell University]] and [[Point Blue Conservation Science]] have continued the study of nesting populations on Mono Lake that was begun 35 years ago. [[Snowy plover]]s also arrive at Mono Lake each spring to nest along the remote eastern shores.

===Native Americans===
{{Further|Kucadikadi|Population of Native California}}
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Mono Lake are from a band of the [[Northern Paiute]], called the [[Kutzadika'a]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mono&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa|title=Kutzadika'a People: Living in Harmony with the Mono Basin|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=31 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615164727/http://monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa|archive-date=15 June 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Northern Paiute language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictdl.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926145711/http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictdl.shtml|archivedate=2010-09-26|title=California Indians and Their Reservations: K|work=SDSU Library and Information Access|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kutzadika'a traditionally forage alkali fly pupae, called kutsavi in their language.&lt;!--- described in kutzadikaa.htm, next sentence ---&gt; Mono Lake was also referred to as Teniega Bah. The origin of the name &quot;Kutzadika'a&quot; is uncertain but could be a [[Yokutsan languages|Yokut]] Native American term for &quot;fly eater&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525094607/http://monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa |archive-date=2017-05-25 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Mono&quot; is derived from &quot;Monachi&quot;, a Yokut term for the tribes that live on both the east and west side of the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Place Names of the High Sierra|first=Francis|last=Farquhar|year=1926|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/m.html|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco|access-date=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606150242/http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/m.html|archive-date=2011-06-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early contact, the first known Mono Lake Paiute chief was [[Captain John (Paiute)|Captain John]]. He was also referred to by the Paiute names of ''Shibana'' or ''Poko Tucket''. Captain John was the son of a Northern Paiute named 'older Captain John.'

The [[Mono tribe]] has two bands: Eastern and Western. The Eastern Mono joined the Western Mono bands' villages annually at [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], [[Yosemite Valley]], and along the [[Merced River]] to gather [[acorn]]s, different plant species, and to trade. The Western Mono traditionally lived in the south-central Sierra Nevada foothills, including [[History of the Yosemite area|Historical Yosemite Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Indians and Their Reservations|work=SDSU Library and Information Access|accessdate=24 July 2009|url=http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictmp.shtml#monowest|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726214650/http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictmp.shtml#monowest|archivedate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|California Water Wars}}

The city of [[Los Angeles]] diverted water from the [[Owens River]] into the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1913. In 1941, the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] extended the Los Angeles Aqueduct system farther northward into the [[Mono Basin]] with the completion of the Mono Craters Tunnel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortieth Annual Report of the Board of Water and Power Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles|url=http://www.monobasinresearch.org/historical/40thannualreport.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414161147/http://monobasinresearch.org/historical/40thannualreport.pdf|archive-date=14 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the Grant Lake Reservoir on Rush Creek and the Upper Owens River. So much water was diverted that [[evaporation]] soon exceeded inflow and the surface level of Mono Lake fell rapidly. By 1982 the lake was reduced to {{convert|37688|acre}}, 69 percent of its 1941 surface area. By 1990, the lake had dropped 45 vertical feet and had lost half its volume relative to the 1941 pre-diversion water level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mono Lake|work=Mono Lake Committee|url=http://monolake.org/about/|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308143123/http://www.monolake.org/about/|archive-date=8 March 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[alkaline]] sands and formerly submerged [[tufa]] towers became exposed, the water salinity doubled, and [[Negit Island]] became a [[peninsula]], exposing the nests of [[California gull]]s to predators (such as  [[coyote]]s), and forcing the gull colony to abandon this site.

In 1974, [[Stanford University]] graduate student [[David Gaines (environmentalist)|David Gaines]] studied the Mono Lake ecosystem, and he became instrumental in alerting the public of the effects of the lower water level.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlchist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/mlc/history|title=History of the Mono Lake Committee|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206052125/http://monolake.org/mlc/history|archive-date=2011-02-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]] funded the first comprehensive ecological study of Mono Lake, conducted by Gaines and undergraduate students from the [[University of California at Davis]], the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]], and [[Earlham College]]. In June 1977, the Davis Institute of Ecology of the [[University of California]] published a report, &quot;An Ecological Study of Mono Lake, California,&quot; which alerted California to the ecological dangers posed by the redirection of water away from the lake for municipal uses.&lt;ref name=mlchist/&gt;

Gaines formed the [[Mono Lake Committee]] in 1978. He and Sally Judy, a UC Davis student, led the committee and pursued an informational tour of California. They joined with the [[Audubon Society]] to fight a now famous court battle, the [[National Audubon Society v. Superior Court]], to protect Mono Lake through state public trust laws.&lt;ref name=mlchist/&gt; While these efforts have resulted in positive change, the surface level is still below historical levels, and exposed shorelines are a source of significant [[alkaline]] dust during periods of high winds.

[[Owens Lake]], the once-navigable terminus of the [[Owens River]] which had sustained a healthy ecosystem, is now a dry lake bed during dry years due to water diversion beginning in the 1920s. Mono Lake was spared this fate when the California State Water Resources Control Board (after over a decade of litigation) issued an order (SWRCB Decision 1631) to protect Mono Lake and its tributary streams on September 28, 1994. SWRCB Board Vice-Chair Marc Del Piero was the sole Hearing Officer (see D-1631). Since that time, the lake level has steadily risen. In 1941 the surface level was at {{convert|6417|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;level&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Lake Levels|work=Mono Basin Research Clearinghouse|url=http://www.monobasinresearch.org/data/levelmonthly.php|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204005132/http://www.monobasinresearch.org/data/levelmonthly.php|archive-date=4 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2013, Mono Lake was at {{convert|6380.6|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=level/&gt; The lake level of {{convert|6392|ft|m|0}} above sea level is the goal, a goal made more difficult during years of drought in the American West.

'''Death Valley''' is a desert valley in [[Eastern California]], in the northern [[Mojave Desert]], bordering the [[Great Basin Desert]]. It is one of the [[Highest temperature recorded on Earth|hottest places on Earth]], along with deserts in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-heat-record-overturneda-personal-account.html|title=World Heat Record Overturned – A Personal Account|publisher=WunderBlog|accessdate=24 October 2016|quote=Consequently, the WMO assessment is that the official highest recorded surface temperature of 56.7°C (134°F) was measured on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch (Death Valley) CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying mostly in [[Inyo County, California]], near the border of California and Nevada, in the [[Great Basin]], east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains, Death Valley constitutes much of [[Death Valley National Park]] and is the principal feature of the [[Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve]].

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of the Death Valley area}}

[[File:California Pleistocene Lakes USGS.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the system of once-interconnected Pleistocene lakes in eastern California (USGS)]]
Death Valley is a [[graben]]—a downdropped block of land between two mountain ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology Underfoot in Death Valley and Owens Valley|first1=RP|last1=Sharp|first2=AF|last2=Glazner|publisher=Mountain Press Publishing|year=1997|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies at the southern end of a geological [[trough (geology)|trough]], [[Walker Lane]], which runs north to Oregon. The valley is bisected by a right lateral [[strike slip fault]] system, comprising the [[Death Valley Fault]] and the [[Furnace Creek Fault]]. The eastern end of the left lateral [[Garlock Fault]] intersects the Death Valley Fault. Furnace Creek and the [[Amargosa River]] flow through part of the valley and eventually disappear into the sands of the valley floor.

Death Valley also contains [[salt pan (geology)|salt pans]]. According to current geological consensus, at various times during the middle of the [[Pleistocene]] era, which ended roughly 10,000–12,000 years ago, an inland lake, [[Lake Manly]], formed in Death Valley. The lake was nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and {{convert|600|ft|m}} deep, the end-basin in a chain of lakes that began with Mono Lake, in the north, and continued through basins down the Owens River Valley, through Searles and China Lakes and the Panamint Valley, to the immediate west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image of the Day: Lake Badwater, Death Valley|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=37536&amp;src=eoa|publisher=NASA|work=Earth Observing System|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the area turned to desert, the water evaporated, leaving an abundance of evaporitic salts, such as common sodium salts and [[borax]], which were later exploited during the modern history of the region, primarily 1883 to 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Celeste Cosby |author2=Jeanette Hawkins |author3=Jani Kushla |author4=Molly Robinson |title=Boron Minerals of Death Valley |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317215452/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Geology/dv/Boron/home.html |archivedate=17 March 2008 |publisher=Clark Science Center, Smith College |year=2009 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Geology/dv/Boron/home.html#History |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Death Valley has a [[subtropical]], [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''), with long, extremely hot summers; short, mild winters; and little rainfall.

The valley is extremely dry because it lies in the [[rain shadow]] of four major mountain ranges (including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Panamint Range]]). Moisture moving inland from the Pacific Ocean must pass eastward over the mountains to reach Death Valley; as air masses are forced upward by each range, they cool and moisture condenses, to fall as rain or snow on the western slopes. When the air masses reach Death Valley, most of the moisture has already been lost and there is little left to fall as precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roof|first=Steven|last2=Callagan|first2=Charlie|year=2003|title=THE CLIMATE OF DEATH VALLEY, CALIFORNIA |url=http://stormbruiser.com/chase/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bams-84-12-1725.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=84|issue= 12|pages=1725–1739|doi=10.1175/bams-84-12-1725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme heat of Death Valley is attributable to a confluence of geographic and topographic factors. Scientists have identified a number of key contributors:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

* '''Solar heating''': The valley's surface (consisting of soil, rocks, sand, etc.) undergoes intense [[Solar irradiance#Irradiance on Earth's surface|solar heating]] because the air is clear and dry, and the land is dark and sparsely vegetated. This is especially noticeable in summer, when the sun is nearly directly overhead.
* '''Trapping of warm air:''' Warm air naturally rises and cools;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@barrywfischer/https-medium-com-barrywfischer-why-is-it-colder-at-higher-elevations-52f6c98544ca|title=Why is it colder at higher elevations? A thorough and visual explanation.|last=Fischer|first=Barry|date=December 20, 2018|website=Medium|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Death Valley this air is subject to continual reheating as it is trapped by high, steep valley walls and recycled back to the valley floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/weather-and-climate.htm|title=Death Valley Weather|publisher=US National Park Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm air also is trapped by the valley's north–south orientation, which runs perpendicular to [[Westerlies|prevailing west-to-east winds]].
* '''Migration of warm air from other areas ([[advection]]):''' Warm desert regions adjacent to Death Valley, especially to the south and east, often heat air before it arrives in Death Valley.
* '''Warm mountain winds:''' As winds are forced up and over mountains (e.g., the numerous ranges west of Death Valley), the winds can be warmed in several ways. The resulting dry, warm winds are known as [[foehn wind]]s. Their warmth can in part be caused by the release of latent heat, which occurs when water vapor condenses into clouds.

Severe heat and dryness contribute to perpetual drought-like conditions in Death Valley and prevent much cloud formation from passing through the confines of the valley, where precipitation is often in the form of a [[virga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Death Valley National Park|title=Weather and Climate|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/weather-and-climate.htm|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|date=23 May 2008|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

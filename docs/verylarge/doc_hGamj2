It has been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for chronic [[sinusitis]].

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Izano EA, Gopal P |title=Low Levels of β-Lactam Antibiotics Induce Extracellular DNA Release and Biofilm Formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=mBio |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2012 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00198-12|pmid=22851659 |pmc=3419523 |display-authors=etal |pages=e00198–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the [[tragedy of the commons]] in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.eg/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=17231892830113723348&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=ar] Ibrahim, Ahmed (2015): The tragedy of the commons and prisoner's dilemma may improve our realization of the theory of life and provide us with advanced therapeutic ways. figshare.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' ===
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa|P. aeruginosa]]'' represents a commonly used biofilm [[model organism]] since it is involved in different types of biofilm-associated chronic infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rybtke M, Hultqvist LD, Givskov M, Tolker-Nielsen T | title = Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Infections: Community Structure, Antimicrobial Tolerance and Immune Response | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 427 | issue = 23 | pages = 3628–45 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26319792 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2015.08.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such infections include chronic wounds, chronic otitis media, chronic prostatitis and chronic lung infections in [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF) patients.

=== ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' ===

''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of sepsis in HIV-infected persons. When ''S. pneumoniae'' grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16925554&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oggioni MR, Trappetti C, Kadioglu A, Cassone M, Iannelli F, Ricci S, Andrew PW, Pozzi G | display-authors = 6 | title = Switch from planktonic to sessile life: a major event in pneumococcal pathogenesis | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 1196–210 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16925554 | pmc = 1618759 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05310.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formation of a biofilm depends on competence stimulating peptide (CSP). CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of ''S. pneumoniae'' to survive the defenses of the host.&lt;ref name=Michod /&gt; In particular, the host's polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22706053&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei H, Håvarstein LS |title=Fratricide is essential for efficient gene transfer between pneumococci in biofilms |journal=Appl.

The insect antimicrobial peptide [[Cecropin#Members|cecropin A]] can destroy planktonic and sessile biofilm-forming [[Uropathogenic Escherichia coli|uropathogenic ''E. Coli'']] cells, either alone or when combined with the antibiotic [[nalidixic acid]], synergistically clearing infection in vivo (in the insect host ''[[Galleria mellonella]]'') without off-target cytotoxicity. The multi-target mechanism of action involves outer membrane permeabilization followed by biofilm disruption triggered by the inhibition of efflux pump activity and interactions with extracellular and intracellular nucleic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalsy M, Tonk M, Hardt M, Dobrindt U, Zdybicka-Barabas A, Cytrynska M, Vilcinskas A, Mukherjee K  | title = The insect antimicrobial peptide cecropin A disrupts uropathogenic Escherichia coli biofilms | journal = NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = 2020 | pmid = 32051417 | doi = 10.1038/s41522-020-0116-3  | pmc = 7016129 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidly expanding worldwide industry for biomedical devices and tissue engineering related products is already at $180 billion per year, yet this industry continues to suffer from microbial colonization.

Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a [[secondary treatment]] stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of communities of [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter9&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|vauthors=Martins dos Santos VA, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/microbialbiodegr0000unse/page/1971 1971]|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&amp;pg=PA1971| veditors = Díaz E|url=https://archive.org/details/microbialbiodegr0000unse/page/1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food industry ===
Biofilms have become problematic in several food industries due to the ability to form on plants and during industrial processes.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srey S | title = Biofilm formation in food industries: A food safety concern }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;T.

== Eukaryotic biofilms ==
{{See also|Phototrophic biofilms}}
Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16897306&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Colen 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cooksey K, Wigglesworth-Cooksey B | year = 1995 | title = Adhesion of bacteria and diatoms to surfaces in the sea: a review | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.3354/ame009087| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[microalgae]] are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathogenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fanning S, Mitchell AP | year = 2012 | title = Fungal Biofilms | journal = PLOS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e1002585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002585 | pmid = 22496639 | pmc = 3320593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11514524&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra J, Kuhn DM, Mukherjee PK, Hoyer LL, McCormick T, Ghannoum MA | title = Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance | journal = J.

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including [[mycorrhiza]] have been shown to decompose organic matter, protect plants from bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Burmølle M, Kjøller A, Sørenses S | veditors = Lear G, Gavin L, Lewis G |title=Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications|date=2012|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|isbn=978-1904455967|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by [[diatom]]s. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid27009999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25268215&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele DJ, Franklin DJ, Underwood GJ | title = Protection of cells from salinity stress by extracellular polymeric substances in diatom biofilms | journal = Biofouling | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 987–98 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25268215 | pmc = 4706044 | doi = 10.1080/08927014.2014.960859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the [[phycosphere]], but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26986529&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windler M, Leinweber K, Bartulos CR, Philipp B, Kroth PG | title = Biofilm and capsule formation of the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum are affected by a bacterium | journal = J.

== Biofilm cultivation devices ==
There is a wide variety of biofilm cultivation devices to mimic natural environments. Although it is important to consider that the particular experimental platform for biofilm experiments determines what kind of biofilm is cultivated and the data that can be extracted. They can be grouped into the following: [[Microplate|microtiter plates]], MBEC (formally known as Calgary device), The ring test, robbins and modified robbins, drip flow reactors, rotary devices, flow chambers, and microfluidic approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Azeredo|first1=Joana|last2=Azevedo|first2=Nuno F.|last3=Briandet|first3=Romain|last4=Cerca|first4=Nuno|last5=Coenye|first5=Tom|last6=Costa|first6=Ana Rita|last7=Desvaux|first7=Mickaël|last8=Bonaventura|first8=Giovanni Di|last9=Hébraud|first9=Michel|last10=Jaglic|first10=Zoran|last11=Kačániová|first11=Miroslava|date=2017-05-04|title=Critical review on biofilm methods|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2016.1208146|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=313–351|doi=10.1080/1040841X.2016.1208146|issn=1040-841X|pmid=27868469|s2cid=3991858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely related to [[planet formation]], another branch of [[astronomy]].  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

A [[spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way contains [[star]]s, [[stellar remnant]]s, and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is typically composed of roughly 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or ''[[diffuse nebulae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=C.

===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] as long as the [[kinetic energy]] of the gas [[pressure]] is in balance with the [[potential energy]] of the internal [[gravitational force]]. Mathematically this is expressed using the [[virial theorem]], which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the [[Jeans mass]]. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; During cloud collapse dozens to ten thousands of stars form more or less simultaneously which is observable in so-called [[Embedded cluster|embedded clusters]].

In ''triggered star formation'', one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its [[gravitational collapse]]. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby [[supernova]] explosion can be a trigger, sending [[Shock wave|shocked]] matter into the cloud at very high speeds.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing [[SSPSF model|self-propagating star formation]].)

A [[supermassive black hole]] at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become [[Active galactic nucleus|active]], emitting a strong wind through a collimated [[relativistic jet]]. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of [[gravitational]] [[potential energy]].  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of {{nowrap|60–100 K}}, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; g / cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A core region, called the first hydrostatic core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;
[[Image:Cepheus B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Composite image]] showing young stars in and around molecular cloud [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] B.]]

The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt;
[[Image:N11 (Hubble).jpg|thumb|right| N11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.]]
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed [[circumstellar disc]]. When the density and temperature are high enough, [[deuterium fusion]] begins, and the outward [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to &quot;rain&quot; onto the [[protostar]]. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called [[Herbig–Haro object]]s. This is probably the means by which excess [[angular momentum]] of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.

When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a [[pre-main-sequence star]] (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a [[Hayashi track]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | date=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction will proceed until the [[Hayashi limit]] is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]] with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the [[Henyey track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. G. Henyey | author2 = R. Lelevier | author3 = R. D.

Finally, [[hydrogen]] begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's [[main sequence]] phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around {{Solar mass|1}} or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars is studied in [[stellar evolution]].

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and [[rotational transition]]s of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and [[radio astronomy|submillimeter]] range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in [[infrared|infrared astronomy]] wavelengths, as the [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

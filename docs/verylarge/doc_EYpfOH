It lies on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]].

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Church of England]] and the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] owing to the importance of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]], who served as the [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]] to the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] [[Kingdom of Kent]] around the turn of the 7th century. The city's [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral]] became a major focus of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] following the 1170 [[Martyr of the Faith|martyrdom]] of [[Thomas Becket]], although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012. A journey of pilgrims to Becket's shrine served as the [[narrative frame|frame]] for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 14th century [[Western canon|classic]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.

Canterbury is a popular tourist destination: consistently one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/england/kent-and-sussex/canterbury.aspx |title=Canterbury &amp;#124; The Southeast Guide |publisher=Rough Guides |date=1 June 1942 |accessdate=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122023406/http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/england/kent-and-sussex/canterbury.aspx |archivedate=22 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the city's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism. The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the [[list of Celtic tribes|Celtic]] [[Cantiaci]] and [[Jutes|Jute]] [[Kingdom of Kent]]. Many historical structures fill the area, including a city wall founded in [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] and rebuilt in the 14th century, the ruins of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] and a [[Canterbury Castle|Norman castle]], and the [[List of the oldest schools in the world|oldest extant school in the world]], [[The King's School, Canterbury|the King's School]]. Modern additions include the [[Marlowe Theatre]] and the [[St Lawrence Ground]], home of the [[Kent County Cricket Club]]. There is also a substantial student population, brought about by the presence of the [[University of Kent]], [[Canterbury Christ Church University]], the [[University for the Creative Arts]], and the [[Girne American University|Girne American University&amp;nbsp;Canterbury campus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Girne American University Canterbury|url = http://www.gauc.org.uk/|website = www.gauc.org.uk|accessdate = 29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canterbury remains, however, a small city in terms of geographical size and population, when compared with other [[British cities]].

The [[Ancient Romans|Roman]] [[Roman occupation of Britannia|settlement]] of ''[[Durovernum Cantiacorum]]'' (&quot;[[Cantiaci|Kentish]] Durovernum&quot;) occupied the location of an earlier [[Britons (Celtic people)|British]] town whose [[British language (Celtic)|ancient British]] name has been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''Durou̯ernon'' (&quot;stronghold by the alder grove&quot;),&lt;ref name=ly29&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although the name is sometimes supposed to have derived from various British names for the [[River Stour, Kent|Stour]].&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol11/pp135-139|title=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent|volume=XI|publisher=W.&amp;nbsp;Bristow|location=Canterbury|date=1800|last=Hasted|first=Edward|pages=135–139|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medieval variants of the Roman name include ''Dorobernia'' and ''Dorovernia''.)&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; In [[Sub-Roman Britain]], it was known in [[Old Welsh]] as ''[[Caer|Cair]] Ceint'' (&quot;stronghold of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=nenny&gt;[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}).

=== Early history ===
[[File:Staugustinescanterburyrotundanaveandcathedral.jpg|thumb|St. Augustine's Abbey, which forms part of the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, was where Christianity was brought to England.]]
{{main|Durovernum Cantiacorum}}
The Canterbury area has been inhabited since [[prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]]. [[Lower Paleolithic]] axes, and [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] pots have been found in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the [[list of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]] of the [[Cantiaci]], which inhabited most of modern-day [[Kent]]. In the 1st century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] captured the settlement and named it [[Durovernum Cantiacorum]].&lt;ref name=ly29/&gt; The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets [[Roman urban planning|in a grid pattern]], a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], a [[Roman temple|temple]], a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], and [[Roman baths|public baths]].&lt;ref name=lyle43/&gt; Although they did not maintain a major military garrison, its position on [[Watling Street]] relative to the major Kentish ports of [[Rutupiae]] ([[Richborough]]), [[Dubrae]] ([[Dover]]), and [[Lemanae]] ([[Lymne]]) gave it considerable strategic importance.{{sfn|Godfrey-Faussett|1878|p=29}} In the late 3rd century, to defend against attack from [[Saxon invasions of Britain|barbarians]], the Romans built an earth bank around the city and a wall with seven gates, which enclosed an area of {{convert|130|acre|ha|0}}.&lt;ref name=lyle43&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=43–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Augustine Abbey.jpg|thumb|St. Augustine's Abbey gateway]]
Despite being counted as one of the 28 cities of [[Sub-Roman Britain]],&lt;ref name=nenny/&gt;&lt;ref name=nashford/&gt; it seems that after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Romans left Britain in 410]] Durovernum Cantiacorum was abandoned for around 100 years, except by a few farmers and gradually decayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next 100&amp;nbsp;years, an [[Anglo-Saxon]] community formed within the [[Canterbury city walls|city walls]], as [[Jutes|Jutish]] refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=42, 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 597, [[Pope Gregory the Great]] sent [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] to convert its [[Æthelberht of Kent|King Æthelberht]] to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, being a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his [[episcopal see]] in Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=47–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, [[gold coin]]s were being struck at the Canterbury mint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=48–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 672, the [[Synod of Hertford]] gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;c4&quot;/&gt;

In 842 and 851, Canterbury suffered great loss of life during [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] raids. In 978, Archbishop [[Dunstan]] refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it [[St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury|St Augustine's Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siege of Canterbury]] saw a large Viking army besiege Canterbury in 1011, culminating in the city being pillaged and the eventual murder of Archbishop [[Alphege]] in 19 April 1012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Peter Sawyer |title = The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings |location=London |publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn= 978-0-19-285434-6 | page=75|year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist [[William the Conqueror]]'s invasion in 1066.&lt;ref name=&quot;c4&quot;/&gt; William immediately ordered a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] castle to be built by the Roman city wall. In the early 12th century, the [[Canterbury Castle|castle]] was rebuilt with stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=64, 66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canterbury Holland Chaucer statue.jpg|thumb|185px|Statue of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], dressed as a Canterbury pilgrim, on the corner of Best Lane and the High Street, Canterbury]]
After the murder of the Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]] at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Descriptive Gazetteer entry for Canterbury | publisher=Vision of Britain| url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=842560&amp;word=NULL |  accessdate =28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] provided the framework for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 14th-century collection of stories, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-canterbury-tales-by-geoffrey-chaucer|title=The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canterbury Castle was captured by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of [[John of England|John]] caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].{{sfn|Godfrey-Faussett |1878|p=29}}

Canterbury is associated with several saints from this period who lived in Canterbury:
* Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]]
* Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]]
* Saint [[Thomas Becket]]
* Saint [[Mellitus]]
* Saint [[Theodore of Tarsus]]
* Saint [[Dunstan]]

=== 14th–17th centuries ===
[[File:huguenot canterbury.jpg|right|thumb|[[Huguenot]] weavers' houses near the High Street]]
The [[Black Death]] hit Canterbury in 1348. At 10,000, Canterbury had the 10th largest population in England; by the early 16th century, the population had fallen to 3,000. In 1363, during the [[Hundred Years' War]], a Commission of Inquiry found that disrepair, stone-robbing and ditch-filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded. Between 1378 and 1402, the wall was virtually rebuilt, and new wall towers were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1381, during [[Wat Tyler]]'s [[Peasants' Revolt]], the castle and Archbishop's Palace were sacked, and [[Simon Sudbury|Archbishop Sudbury]] was beheaded in London. Sudbury is still remembered annually by the Christmas mayoral procession to his tomb at Canterbury Cathedral. In 1413 [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral. In 1448 Canterbury was granted a [[City Charter]], which gave it a mayor and a [[high sheriff]]; the city still has a [[Lord Mayor]] and Sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1504 the cathedral's main tower, the Bell Harry Tower, was completed, ending 400&amp;nbsp;years of building.

[[File:Westgate, Canterbury - geograph.org.uk - 983532.jpg|left|thumb|The Westgate is the largest surviving city gate in England. It survived a demolition attempt for a road-widening scheme in Victorian times.]]

During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the city's [[priory]], [[nunnery]] and three [[friaries]] were closed. St Augustine's Abbey, the 14th richest in England at the time, was surrendered to the Crown, and its church and [[cloister]] were levelled. The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15&amp;nbsp;years, although part of the site was converted to a palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=97–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Becket]]'s shrine in the cathedral was demolished and all the gold, silver and jewels were removed to [[Tower of London|the Tower of London]], and Becket's images, name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom, ending the [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]].

By the 17th century, Canterbury's population was 5,000; of whom 2,000 were [[French language|French-speaking]] Protestant [[Huguenots]], who had begun fleeing persecution and war in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the mid-16th century. The Huguenots introduced silk weaving into the city, which by 1676 had outstripped wool weaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyle&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620 [[Robert Cushman]] negotiated the lease of the ''[[Mayflower]]'' at 59 Palace Street for the purpose of transporting the [[Pilgrims]] to [[Americas|America]].

In 1647, during the [[English Civil War]], riots broke out when Canterbury's puritan mayor banned [[church service]]s on Christmas Day. The rioters' trial the following year led to a Kent revolt against the Parliamentarian forces, contributing to the start of the [[Second English Civil War|second phase]] of the war. However, Canterbury surrendered peacefully to the Parliamentarians after their victory at the [[Battle of Maidstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians were strafed and bombed throughout the city resulting in twenty-eight bombs dropped and 30 people killed. Three German planes were shot down by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].

Before the end of the war, architect [[Charles Holden]] drew up plans to redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10&amp;nbsp;years after the war.&lt;ref name=Butler14&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2002|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, with the arrival of the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] and [[Canterbury Christ Church University|Christ Church College]].&lt;ref name = Butler14 /&gt;

== Governance ==
The Member of Parliament for the [[Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Canterbury]] constituency, which includes Whitstable, is [[Rosie Duffield]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

Canterbury, along with Whitstable and Herne Bay, is in the [[City of Canterbury]] [[Districts of England|local government district]]. The city's urban area consists of the six electoral [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Barton, Blean Forest, Northgate, St Stephens, Westgate, and Wincheap. These wards have eleven of the fifty seats on the [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury]] [[City council|City Council]]. Six of these seats are held by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], four by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and one by [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]].

The city became a [[county corporate]] in 1461, and later a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. In 1974 it lost its status as the smallest county borough in England, after the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and came under the control of [[Kent County Council]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Canterbury town walls - geograph.org.uk - 1117994.jpg|thumb|[[Canterbury city walls]]]]
Canterbury is in east Kent, about {{convert|55|mi|km|0}} east-southeast of London. The coastal towns of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] and [[Whitstable]] are {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} to the north, and [[Faversham]] is {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} to the northwest. Nearby villages include [[Chartham]], [[Rough Common]], [[Sturry]] and [[Tyler Hill, Kent|Tyler Hill]]. The civil parish of [[Thanington Without]] is to the southwest; the rest of the city is unparished. St Dunstan's, St Stephen's, Longport, Stuppington, [[Wincheap]] and [[Hales Place]] are suburbs of the city.

The city is on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour or Great Stour]], flowing from its source at [[Lenham]] north-east through [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] to the [[English Channel]] at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. As it flows north-east, the river divides west of the city, one branch flowing through the city centre, and the other around the position of the former walls. The two branches create several [[river island]]s before finally recombining around the town of [[Fordwich]] on the edge of the marshland north east of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background information on the River Stour |url=https://www.kentishstour.org.uk/major-projects-2/the-stour-catchment/background-river-stour/ |website=kentishstour.org.uk |accessdate=14 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stour is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used. Punts and rowed river boats are available for hire in Canterbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterburyrivertours.co.uk/ Kent &amp; Canterbury Tourist Attraction | Canterbury Historic River Tours]. Canterburyrivertours.co.uk. Retrieved on 25 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
The geology of the area consists mainly of [[brickearth]] overlying chalk. Tertiary sands overlain by [[London clay]] form St. Thomas's Hill and St. Stephen's Hill about a mile northwest of the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Museum]] houses an ''in situ'' [[mosaic]] pavement dating from around 300 [[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scheduled monument]] listing held at [[Kent County Council]]&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving structures from the Roman times include Queningate, a blocked gate in the city wall, and the [[Dane John Mound]], once part of a Roman cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dane John Gardens were built beside the mound in the 18th century, and a memorial was placed on the mound's summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tellem|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mills in Canterbury|windmill]] was on the mound between 1731 and 1839.

The [[Westgate, Canterbury|Westgate]] is now a museum relating to its history as a jail. The medieval church of [[Ælfheah of Canterbury|St Alphege]] became redundant in 1982 but had a new lease of life as the Canterbury Urban Studies Centre, later renamed the Canterbury Environment Centre; the building is used by the [[The King's School, Canterbury|King's School]]. The [[Old Synagogue at Canterbury|Old Synagogue]], now the King's School Music Room, is one of only two [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues still standing. The city centre contains many timber-framed 16th and 17th century houses, however there are far fewer than there were before the [[Second World War]], as many were damaged during the [[Baedeker Blitz]]. Many are still standing, including the &quot;Old Weaver's House&quot; used by the [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyle|2002|pp=142–147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Martin's Mill, Canterbury|St Martin's Mill]] is the only surviving mill out of the six known to have stood in Canterbury.

=== Theatres ===
The city's theatre and concert hall is the [[Marlowe Theatre]] named after [[Christopher Marlowe]], who was born in the city in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]]. He was baptised in the city's St George's Church, which was destroyed during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tellem|2002|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The old Marlowe Theatre was located in St Margaret's Street and housed a repertory theatre. The Gulbenkian Theatre, at the University of Kent, also serves the city, housing also a cinema and café.&lt;ref name = &quot;gulbenkian&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.kent.ac.uk/gulbenkian | title = The Gulbenkian Theatre | publisher=University of Kent | place = UK | date = 25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marlowe Theatre was completely rebuilt and reopened in October 2011.

Besides the two theatres, theatrical performances take place at several areas of the city, for instance the cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey. The premiere of ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]] took place at Canterbury Cathedral.&lt;ref name = &quot;marlowe&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.marlowetheatre.com/ | title = The Marlowe Theatre | place = Canterbury, Kent, UK | accessdate =25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving Tudor theatre in Canterbury is now the Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespearecanterbury.co.uk|title=The Shakespeare|website=shakespearecanterbury.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as Casey's. There are several theatre groups based in Canterbury, including the [[University of Kent Students' Union]]'s T24 Drama Society, The Canterbury Players&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.thecanterburyplayers.co.uk/ | title = The Canterbury Players: Canterbury's leading amateur dramatics group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kent Youth Theatre.

==== Marlowe Theatre ====
The redeveloped [[Marlowe Theatre]] is (at the time of writing) the largest theatre in the region, offering touring productions and concerts. The programme includes musicals, drama, ballet, contemporary dance, classical orchestras, opera, children's shows, pantomime, stand-up comedy and concerts. There is also a second performance space called the Marlowe Studio, dedicated to creative activity and the programming of new work.
The Marlowe Theatre can be seen from many points throughout the city centre, considering it is the only modern and tall structure.

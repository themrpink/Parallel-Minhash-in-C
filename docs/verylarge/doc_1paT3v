=== Activity in psychoanalytic therapy ===

Contrary to Freud's opinion of therapeutic [[Abstinence (psychoanalysis)|abstinence]], Ferenczi advocated a more active role for the analyst. For example, instead of the relative &quot;passivity&quot; of a listening analyst encouraging the patient to freely associate, Ferenczi used to curtail certain responses, verbal and non-verbal alike, on the part of the analysand so as to allow suppressed thoughts and feelings to emerge. {{harvtxt|Ferenczi|1980}} described in a case study how he used a kind of [[behavioral activation]] (uncommon in the psychoanalytic therapy at that time) when he asked an opera singer with performance anxiety to “perform” during a therapy session and in this way to struggle with her fears {{harv|Rachman|2007}}.

=== Clinical empathy in psychoanalysis ===

Ferenczi believed the empathic response during therapy was the basis of clinical interaction. He based his intervention on responding to the subjective experience of the analysand. If the more traditional opinion
was that the analyst had the role of a physician, administering a treatment to the patient based upon diagnostic judgment of psychopathology, Ferenczi wanted the analysand to become a co-participant in an encounter created by the therapeutic dyad. This emphasis on empathic reciprocity during the therapeutic encounter was an important contribution to the evolution of psychoanalysis. Ferenczi also believed that self-disclosure of the analyst is an important therapeutic reparative force. The practice of including the therapist's personality in therapy resulted in the development of the idea of mutual encounter: the therapist is allowed to discuss some content from his/her own life and thoughts, as long as it is relevant to the therapy. This is in contrast to the Freudian therapeutic abstinence according to which the therapist should not involve his/her personal life with the therapy, and should remain neutral (ibid.). The mutual encounter is a precedent for the psychoanalytic theory of two-person psychology.

=== The &quot;confusion of tongues&quot; theory of trauma ===

Ferenczi believed that the persistent traumatic effect of chronic overstimulation, deprivation, or empathic failure (a term further elaborated by [[Heinz Kohut]]) during childhood is what causes neurotic, character, borderline and psychotic disorders (ibid.). According to this concept, trauma develops as a result of the sexual seduction of a child by a parent or authority figure. The confusion of tongues occurs when the child pretends to be the spouse of the parent. The pathological adult interprets this infantile and innocent game according to his adult &quot;passion tongue&quot; and then forces the child to conform to his passion tongue. The adult uses a tongue the child does not know, and interprets the child's innocent game (his infantile tongue) according to his disturbed perspective. For example, a father is playing with his little girl. During their common game, she offers him the role of her husband and wants him to sleep with her just as he sleeps with her mother. The pathological father misinterprets this childish offer, and touches his daughter in an inappropriate manner while they are in bed together. Here, the child spoke her innocent childish tongue, and the father interpreted her offer with his passionate adult sexual tongue.
The adult also attempts to convince the child that the lust on his part is really the love for which the child yearns. Ferenczi generalized the idea of trauma to emotional neglect, physical maltreatment, and empathic failure. The prominent manifestation of these disturbances would be the sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;''Trauma-related lectures and notes''. {{cite book |first=Sándor |last=Ferenczi |title=Infantil-Angriffe! - Über sexuelle Gewalt, Trauma und Dissoziation |url=http://www.autonomie-und-chaos.de/sandor-ferenczi-infantil-angriffe-ueber-sexuelle-gewalt-trauma-und-dissoziation-pdf |location=[[Berlin]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-3-923-21136-4|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Lynn Asprin''' (June 28, 1946 – May 22, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- [http://www.mythadventures.net Asprin's homepage] --&gt; [http://mythadventures.net/robert-asprin-memorial-page/ Memorial page]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American science fiction and [[fantasy authors|fantasy author]] and [[science fiction fandom|active fan]], best known for his humorous ''[[MythAdventures]]'' and ''[[Phule's Company (series)|Phule's Company]]'' series.

== Background ==
Robert Asprin was born in [[St. Johns, Michigan]], and attended the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] from 1964 through 1965. From 1965 through 1966 he served in the [[United States Army]]. He was married (twice) and had two children. He was active in [[science fiction fandom]] and in the early years of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] under the name &quot;Yang the Nauseating&quot;, and co-founded the [[Great Dark Horde]] in 1971. He was also the founder and an influential member of the [[Dorsai Irregulars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.di.org/di_top.htm Dorsai Irregulars website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121062748/http://di.org/di_top.htm |date=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, he was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]] for ''[[The Capture (cartoon)|The Capture]]'', a [[cartoon]] [[slide show]] written by Asprin and drawn by [[Phil Foglio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early writing ==
Asprin's first novel, ''[[The Cold Cash War]]'', an expansion of an earlier short story of the same title, was published in 1977.

Over the next few years, he created and edited (with his then-wife, [[Lynn Abbey]]) the ''[[Thieves' World]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thieves' World]]&lt;/ref&gt; series of [[shared universe|shared world]] anthologies, credited as the first project of its type. Soon after the series hit its stride, many of the authors produced novels and stories outside the anthologies, beginning with ''Beyond Sanctuary'' by [[Janet Morris]], the first &quot;authorized&quot; Thieves World novel, published in 1985. Janet Morris and [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]] went on to produce two more authorized Thieves' World &quot;Beyond&quot; novels and a series of related novels about their immortalized character, Tempus, and [[the Sacred Band of Stepsons]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sacred Band of Stepsons]] saga, [[Janet Morris]] and [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]] (1985–2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A series of [[graphic novel]]s followed in the mid-1980s, and several other authors, including [[Andrew J. Offutt]] and [[David Drake]], published novels about their characters. In 2002, Lynn Abbey resurrected the series with the novel ''Sanctuary''.

In 1978, Asprin began the &quot;[[MythAdventures]]&quot; series, chronicling the comic adventures of Skeeve and Aahz, with the book ''[[Another Fine Myth]]''. Originally illustrated by [[Frank Kelly Freas]], and later by [[Phil Foglio]], the highly [[pun]]-driven books follow a &quot;demon&quot; magician who has lost his powers and his inexperienced human apprentice as they travel through a variety of worlds in pursuit of finding their place in life, though under the guise of seeking wealth and glory. Some of the early &quot;Myth&quot; novels were later adapted as comic books by [[Phil Foglio|Foglio]] and others. The Myth books have passed through three publishing companies over the years:  [[The Donning Company|Donning Starblaze]], [[Meisha Merlin]] and, as of 2008, [[Wildside Press]].

In the 1990s, Asprin's &quot;Phule&quot; novels followed the humorous science-fiction exploits of a rag-tag company of the &quot;Space Legion&quot; and its wealthy and iconoclastic leader, Willard Phule.

== Hiatus in writing career ==
Due to a series of personal and financial problems, Asprin stopped writing in the 1990s. He had two books on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] which piqued the interest of fans and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. Unfortunately this came right at the time of an almost seven-year writing drought. He eventually negotiated an agreement with the IRS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crescentblues.com/4_5issue/int_asprin_delcarlo2.shtml &quot;Robert Asprin and Eric Del Carlo: ''No Quarter''&quot;], Crescent Blues, Volume 4, Issue 5 (August 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that encouraged him to return to writing, and, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, he wrote several novels in collaboration with authors [[Peter Heck]], [[Jody Lynn Nye]], and [[Linda Evans (author)|Linda Evans]]. These novels included continuations of the &quot;Myth&quot; series and the &quot;Phule&quot; series as well as works in new series.

== Later work ==
One of Asprin's last projects was ''NO Quarter'', originally co-authored with Eric Del Carlo, and later edited by Teresa Patterson. It is a dark fantasy/suspense/ murder mystery novel set in the author's beloved New Orleans French Quarter. Although the novel's fantasy elements (voodoo and black magic, tarot readings and precognition, ghosts and mysticism) are secondary to the brutal murder that is the focus of the plot, it is set in the same milieu as Asprin's Griffen McCandles novels (''Dragons'' series), ''Dragons Luck'' and ''Dragons Wild''. The two protagonists of ''NO Quarter'', Maestro and Bone, also appear as minor characters in the ''Dragons'' novels. Maestro, the mysterious pool shark and fencing master in ''NO Quarter'', is a highly fictionalized but recognizable self-portrait of the author. ''NO Quarter'' was published November 2009 by DarkStar Books.

Asprin's ofttimes co-author, [[Jody Lynn Nye]], has completed one further Griffen McCandles novel, ''Dragons Deal'', and continued the ''Myth Adventures'' series.  ''Dragons Deal'' was published by Ace in December 2010.

== Death and aftermath ==
Asprin died on May 22, 2008, of a heart attack at his home in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=47897&amp;cat=14 |title=Trans World News Notice of Death |accessdate=2008-05-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040043/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=47897&amp;cat=14 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sfscope.com/2008/05/author-robert-asprin-dies.html |title=SFScope Notice of Death from Natural Causes |accessdate=2008-05-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192218/http://sfscope.com/2008/05/author-robert-asprin-dies.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found lying on a sofa with a [[Terry Pratchett]] novel still open in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lynnabbey.com/FaceOfChaos/friendship-never-forgotten/ Friendship never forgotten]; by [[Lynn Abbey]]; published May 23, 2008; retrieved June 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He was to have been the Guest of Honor at [[Marcon (convention)|Marcon]] that weekend.&lt;ref&gt;Jody Lynn Nye, &quot;Afterward&quot;, Myth-Fortunes.

'''Monreale''' ([[sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''Murriali'''''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Monreale&quot; is a contraction of ''monte-reale'', &quot;royal mountain&quot;, so-called from a palace built here by [[Roger I of Sicily]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[Metropolitan City of Palermo]], in [[Sicily]], southern [[Italy]]. It is located on the slope of Monte Caputo, overlooking the very fertile valley called ''&quot;La Conca d'oro&quot;'' (the Golden Shell), a production area of orange, olive and almond trees, the produce of which is exported in large quantities.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The town, which has a population of approximately 39,000, is about {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=off}} inland (south) of [[Palermo]], the regional capital. 

Monreale forms [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Monreale|its own archdiocese]] and is home to a historical Norman-Byzantine cathedral. This has been designated as one of several buildings named in a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], a group of nine inscribed as [[Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalù and Monreale]].

==History==
{{See also|History of Palermo|History of Sicily}}
After the occupation of Palermo by the Arabs (the [[Emirate of Sicily]]), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo|Bishop of Palermo]] was forced to move his seat outside the capital. The role of cathedral was assigned to a modest little church, ''Aghia Kiriaki'', in a nearby village later known as Monreale. After [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|the Norman conquest in 1072]], Christians took back [[Palermo Cathedral|the former Palermo cathedral]]. Probably the village's role as temporary ecclesiastical centre played a part in [[William II of Sicily|King William II's]] decision to build a cathedral here.&lt;ref&gt;Rodo Santoro: ''Palermo Cathedral,' Palermo: 1999, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Monreale was a small village for a long time. When the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] [[Kings of Sicily]] chose the area as their hunting resort, more people and commerce came to the area after the royalty built a palace (probably identifiable with the modern town hall).

Under King William II, a large monastery of [[Benedictine]]s coming from [[Cava de' Tirreni]], with its church, was founded and provided with large assets. The new construction also had an important defensive function. Monreale was the seat of the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[archbishop]] of Sicily,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which from then on exerted a significant influence over Sicily.

In the 19th century, underage marriages, or those performed without the blessing of the bride's parents, were known as &quot;the marriages of Monreale&quot;, according to [[Eliza Lynn Linton]]. These referred to marriages performed in remote places, where the law was less observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Eliza Lynn|title=Some Sicilian Customs|date=1885|publisher='The Eclectic Magazine'|edition=41|url=https://archive.org/stream/eclecticmagazin06conggoog#page/n86/mode/2up|quote=The church did not sanction marriage younger than these several ages [20 for men, 18 for women], save in exceptional cases; and any one who assisted at the marriage of a girl below the age of 18, without the consent of her parents or guardians, was imprisoned for life and forfeited all he had. This law, however, was frequently broken in remote places, and especially about Palermo, where &quot;the marriages of Monreale&quot; have passed into a proverb. When a young girl, say of sixteen, marries and has a good childbirth, they say &quot;She has been to Monreale&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Gretna Green]]).

===The Cathedral===
{{main|Monreale Cathedral}}
The cathedral of Monreale is one of the greatest extant examples of [[Norman architecture]]. It was begun in [[1170s in architecture|1174]] by [[William II of Sicily|William II]] and completed four years later. In 1182 the church, dedicated to the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Virgin Mary]], was, by a bull of Pope [[Lucius III]], elevated to the rank of a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan cathedral]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Monreale|volume=18|page=736|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

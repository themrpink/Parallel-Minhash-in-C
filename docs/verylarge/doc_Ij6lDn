In early 1982, Doe Maar were still playing to below-capacity crowds, but that all changed after the March release of the album ''Doris Day'', which became a No.1 hit. Regular television appearances and sellout gigs all over the country, mainly attended by teenagers, made Jansz and Vrienten, already in their 30s, the ultimate pop idols. They enjoyed the success{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}, but Van Collem's heroin addiction was seen as a problem by the other band members; they therefore decided to replace him with [[Jan Pijnenburg (drummer)|Jan Pijnenburg]]&lt;!-- (1955)--&gt;. However, Pijnenburg made one television appearance in May before he was hurt in a car crash. Van Collem came back while his successor spent the next six months recovering. On May 31, Doe Maar opened a sunny edition of [[Pinkpop]]; Belinfante still joined them from time to time, improvising lead vocals on the crowd-favourite &quot;Nederwiet&quot; ('Dutch [[Cannabis strains|weed]]').

Doe Maar's newfound success continued with &quot;Is dit alles&quot;, and gave rise to the [[Nederpop]] (New Dutch Wave) explosion: (relatively) young bands singing in their own language at a time when it was considered unfashionable to do so, much to Jansz concern.

In October, Doe Maar made their second appearance at Flaterpop, an indoor festival celebrating contemporary [[Dutch-language]] music, and they headlined the first edition of the live broadcast of [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica's Rocknight]] following [[English-language]] groups Vitesse and [[Golden Earring]]. Belinfante was available for the event, and a few hours into his 36th birthday, he launched the jam session by singing &quot;Nederwiet&quot;.

By the end of 1982, Doe Maar notched up their first number 1 hit with &quot;De bom&quot; ('the bomb'), a composition by Jansz with the underlying message &quot;what's the point of making a career or doing your homework when the (atomic) bomb can drop at any moment?&quot;

===''Virus'' and overexposure===
In January 1983, Pijnenburg finally rejoined the band, although he spent a few more months walking on crutches. After a warm-up tour, they taped a TV special previewing tracks off their soon-to-be-released album ''4us'' (creative spelling for ''Virus''), which was recorded before Van Collem's departure from the band. The album was released in March and featured three singles, all written by Vrienten: the second no.1 hit, &quot;Pa&quot; (about a father/son dispute), &quot;1 Nacht Alleen&quot; ('one night alone', notable for its second verse of namechecking girls who prevented Vrienten from having a deserved rest), and &quot;Nachtzuster&quot; ('nightnurse'), which was also included in the TV special.

Meanwhile, the band stopped enjoying their success and took a few months off from interviews and radio/television appearances.
This decision backfired, as Doe Maar mania grew even bigger.

===International tours===
In September 1983, Doe Maar embarked on their first proper tour of Belgium with a surprise performance at Flaterpop (October 9) thrown in for good measure. Jansz released his debut novel ''Gideon's droom'' which was based on an East-West theme. Vrienten recorded his first Dutch-language solo album (''Geen ballade'', 'no ballad', released in March 1984) with help from his friends. All Doe Maar members played on the closing instrumental &quot;Amstel Hotel 13:00&quot;.

The band rounded off the year by touring the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. In between shows on [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]], they recorded a new single, &quot;Macho&quot;, with the b-side &quot;Grote broer&quot; ('big brother', referring to the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]''), which was released in January 1984 and peaked at No.12.

===Breakup===
In February 1984, Doe Maar went into the studio to record their fifth album; however, the band couldn't get into the recording, and during a crisis meeting on February 13 they decided to call it a day. The split was officially announced three days later after a newspaper leak. The [[NOS Journaal|8 o'clock news]] spoke of &quot;weeping teenage girls who couldn't believe that it was all over&quot;.

Shocked by their fans' responses, Doe Maar played two farewell concerts at the Maaspoort in [[Den Bosch]] on April 14. Both shows were broadcast live on radio and television and featured special guest appearances. During the matinee, which didn't sell out, [[Herman Brood]] and [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] musician [[Jean Blaute]] joined the band for the first live performance of Vrienten's duet with Brood, &quot;Als je wint&quot; ('when you're a winner'; a song about success and so-called friends). During the evening, the previous lineups were briefly revived while Belinfante performed a special version of &quot;Nederwiet&quot; with improvised lyrics about birds and fish. &quot;De laatste keer&quot; proved to be a fitting closer.

The farewell concert was first re-released in 1995 on CD and VHS at [[Free Record Shop]] only, and is now available on DVD.

===Solo projects===
* [[Ernst Jansz]] continued working with Jan Hendriks as members of the reformed CCC Inc. and Boudewijn de Groot's touring band. He released four solo albums, including ''De overkant'' ('the other side', after his second novel), ''Molenbeekstraat'' ('Molenbeek street') and ''Dromen van Johanna'' ('[[Visions of Johanna]]') featuring translations of [[Bob Dylan]]-songs.
* [[Henny Vrienten]] became a composer of film, TV, and musical soundtracks. He released three more solo albums between 1991 and 2015. In 2016 he formed the supergroup Vreemde Kostgangers ('strange boarders') with Golden Earring guitarist [[George Kooymans]] and Boudewijn de Groot; they released two albums.
* [[Joost Belinfante]] continued to work with both Jansz and Vrienten and remained involved in short-lived projects. In 1997 he released his second solo album, ''Als een rivier'' ('like a river'), also the first without any involvement from the Doe Maar members.
* [[René van Collem]] joined funk/disco band [[Spargo (band)|Spargo]] for their modestly successful swansong album ''[[Step by Step (Spargo)|Step by Step]]'', which was released shortly before Doe Maar played their farewell shows. In 1985, Van Collem continued with the established trio [[Powerplay (band)|Powerplay]]; in true &quot;history repeats&quot; style, he was soon replaced by Pijnenburg. In the 1990s and 2000s, Van Collem drummed in several bands including the critically acclaimed [[Sjako]]. In 2014, he released his book ''Heroine, godverdomme'' ('heroin, goddamn'), named after the &quot;Virus&quot; song inspired by his long-time drug battle. He now works with teenage addicts when not performing.

===A shaky tribute===
In preparation for fresh Doe Maar tracks, a tribute album was released. ''Trillend op m'n benen'' ('shaky legs') featured covers stripped from the ska/reggae angle. The re-released &quot;32 jaar&quot; appeared in both Dutch and English (phonetically translated as &quot;Tastes of Sweet Desire&quot;). [[Belgium|Belgian]] group [[Deus (band)|dEUS]] sampled &quot;Da Da I Love You&quot; by German three-piece [[Trio (band)|Trio]] for their version of &quot;Pa&quot;, but permission came too late to have it included on the Dutch release. Only reggae/rap trio [[Postmen]], also signed to [[V2 Records|V2]], stayed close to the original with their version of &quot;De bom&quot;. Rapper/funnyman [[Def Rhymz]] lightened up this doom-laden track with some nonsense lyrics. It was released as a single and became a top 10 hit in early 2000.

Dutch dance music producer Jonathan Joosten sampled &quot;De bom&quot; for a dance version he titled &quot;Tha Bomb&quot;. During a try-out concert prior to the reunion concerts, he handed a demo to manager Frank van der Meijden. Original author Jansz approved the sample but the original record company and its licensee at the time didn't. The song was pitched to radio 3FM, where it was picked up by radio DJ [[Rob Stenders]] just days before the reunion concerts started. After two weeks, the song was placed on the station's playlist, though no record was released. The official release of the song, on Digidance label Paella, contains an insertion of the sample replayed by studio musicians Bert Meulendijk (guitar), David de Marez Oyens (bass), and with vocals by Johnny Kelvin and Addy van der Zwan. Rumour has it that there was a white-label 12&quot; record that did contain the original sample, which was spread amongst Dutch DJs. Sales of the single dropped after record shops noted the single was different from the version played on radio, but it did peak on Dutch dance charts.

===''Klaar'': older and wiser===
In February 2000, Doe Maar issued two singles on the same day: Vrienten's &quot;Als niet als&quot; ('If, not when') featuring rapper [[Brainpower]], and Jansz' anti-violence track &quot;Watje&quot; ('wimp'), which scored a No.9 position in the Dutch Top 40. An album, ''Klaar'' ('done'), followed in April; Van Collem guested on five tracks while Belinfante was replaced by a three-piece horn section. Vrienten's lyrics dealt with issues like growing older, and ladies' man Jansz had grown up. Hendriks performed his one lead vocal in &quot;De kater&quot; ('the hangover'), a song by Vrienten with a &quot;let's drink our worries away and face the consequences later&quot; theme.

''Klaar'' was released in April 2000 and instantly went gold.

===''Hees van Ahoy'': hoarse throats===
Due to overwhelming ticket demand, the three reunion concerts expanded to a 25-date tour; 8 warm-up shows in both the Netherlands and Belgium, 16 nights at the Ahoy, and 1 at the [[Sportpaleis Antwerp]]. The tour was a success and it was recorded for the live CD/DVD ''Hees van Ahoy'', released in November 2000.

===More reunions===
Boudewijn de Groot's 2004 album ''Eiland in de Verte'' ('distant island') features one song with Jansz, Vrienten, and Hendriks.

In 2007, the entire band attended the premiere of ''Doe Maar: The Musical'', for which Henny did supervising work.

Against anyone's expectations, Doe Maar played eight shows in 2008 with Belinfante as the fifth man; four club dates (June), a three-night residency at Rotterdam's [[Feijenoord|Feijenoord Stadium]] (July 11, 12, 13), and a performance at Belgium's brand new [[Werchter|Werchter Boutique]] festival. Henny was quoted as saying &quot;This is not a reunion, we're back together&quot;.

===2012–present===
In September 2012, Doe Maar released the 2-CD ''Versies/De Limmen Tapes'' featuring rerecordings of their classic songs plus a brand new track co-written with singer-translator [[Jan Rot]], who appeared in the musical. ''Versies'' ('versions') consists of rap collaborations produced by Postmen's [[Remon Stotijn|Remon 'The Anonymous Mis' Stotijn]]. In October, the band staged a few try-outs for their headlining slot at the ''[[Symphonica in Rosso]]'' concert series; Van Collem was back on drums, replacing Pijnenburg, who now lives in Spain.

In early 2013, Doe Maar embarked on the Glad IJs tour ('slippery ice tour'). In 2016, they celebrated the 32nd anniversary of their break-up and released a Dutch translation of ''[[54-46 That's My Number]]'' with reggae singer [[Kenny B]]. In 2017, the band played a few festival dates including BLØF's annual [[Concert At Sea]].

In February 2018, a tour was announced in celebration of their 40th anniversary.

'''Baby boomers''' are the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[Silent Generation]] and preceding [[Generation X]]. The [[generation]] is generally defined as people born from 1946 to 1964, during the [[post–World War II baby boom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sheehan |first1=Paul |title=Greed of boomers led us to a total bust |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/greed-of-boomers-led-us-to-a-total-bust-20110925-1krki.html |access-date=21 May 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521015111/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/greed-of-boomers-led-us-to-a-total-bust-20110925-1krki.html?js-chunk-not-found-refresh=true |archive-date=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby boom has been described variously as a &quot;shockwave&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Owram1997x&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Owram | first = Doug | year = 1997 | title = Born at the Right Time | isbn = 0-8020-8086-3 | publisher = Univ Of Toronto Press | location = Toronto | page = [https://archive.org/details/bornatrighttimeh0000owra/page/ x] | url = https://archive.org/details/bornatrighttimeh0000owra/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;the pig in the python.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jones1980&gt;{{Citation| last = Jones | first = Landon| year = 1980| title = Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation| publisher = Coward, McCann and Geoghegan| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby boomers are often parents of late Gen Xers and [[Millennials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RebeccaLeung&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Leung|date=4 September 2005|title=The Echo Boomers – 60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/01/60minutes/main646890.shtml|access-date=24 August 2010|archive-date=November 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104142419/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/01/60minutes/main646890.shtml|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, in the West, as this relatively large number of young people entered their teens and young adulthood—the oldest turned 18 in 1964—they, and those around them, created a very specific [[rhetoric]] around their cohort and the social movements brought about by their size in numbers, such as the [[counterculture of the 1960s]],&lt;ref name=Owram1997xi&gt;{{Citation | last = Owram | first = Doug | year = 1997 | title = Born at the Right Time | isbn = 0-8020-8086-3 | publisher = Univ Of Toronto Press | location = Toronto | page = [https://archive.org/details/bornatrighttimeh0000owra/page/ xi] | url = https://archive.org/details/bornatrighttimeh0000owra/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its backlash.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; In China during the same period, the baby boomers lived through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and were subject to the [[one-child policy]] as adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Woodruff|first1=Judy|last2=French|first2=Howard|date=August 1, 2016|title=The unprecedented aging crisis that's about to hit China|work=PBS Newshour|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/unprecedented-aging-crisis-thats-hit-china|url-status=live|access-date=August 13, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926152123/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/unprecedented-aging-crisis-thats-hit-china}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric had an important impact in the perceptions of the boomers, as well as society's increasingly common tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], many boomers came of age in a time of increasing affluence and widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education,&lt;ref name=&quot;Owram1997x&quot;/&gt; and grew up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones1980&quot;/&gt; Those with higher standards of living and educational levels were often the most demanding of betterment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:27&quot; /&gt; In many countries, the period from the late 1960s to the early- to mid-1970s was one of deep political instability thanks to the postwar youth bulge.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:24&quot; /&gt; That this group reached puberty and maximum height earlier than previous generations added to the tension between the generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:29&quot; /&gt;

The 1950s and 1960s saw significant reforms in education, both as part of the ideological confrontation that was the Cold War,&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt; and as a continuation of the interwar period.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:22&quot; /&gt;

In the 2020s, baby boomers in developed countries, with a few exceptions, are the single biggest cohort in their societies due to sub-replacement fertility and population aging.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zeihan|first=Peter|title=The Absent Superpower: The Shale Revolution and a World without America|publisher=Zeihan on Geopolitics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9985052-0-6|location=Austin, TX|chapter=Chapter 5: The End of the (Old) World|postscript=.

==Etymology==
The term [[baby boom]] refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-[[World War II]] population increase was described as a &quot;boom&quot; by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column in the May 4, 1951, edition of the ''[[New York Post]]'', based on the increase of 2,357,000 in the population of the U.S. in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest'' August 1951 pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of &quot;baby boomer&quot; is in a January 1963 ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'' article describing a massive surge of college enrollments approaching as the oldest boomers were coming of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/542159/how-generations-named-baby-boomers-generation-x-millennials|title=How Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials Got Their Names|date=May 1, 2018|access-date=September 25, 2018|archive-date=October 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010015756/http://mentalfloss.com/article/542159/how-generations-named-baby-boomers-generation-x-millennials|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nason |first1=Leslie J. |title=Baby Boomers, Grown Up, Storm Ivy-Covered Walls |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19690752/daily_press/ |access-date=28 March 2019 |work=Daily Press |date=28 January 1963 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328230347/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19690752/daily_press/ |archive-date=28 March 2019 |location=Newport, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the modern meaning of the term to a January 23, 1970, article in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=baby boomer |work=Oxford English Dictionary |date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: the &quot;Leading-Edge Baby Boomers&quot; are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the [[Vietnam War]] era. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people of all races. The other half of the generation, called the &quot;Late Boomers&quot; or &quot;Trailing-Edge Boomers&quot;, was born between 1956 and 1964. This second cohort includes about 37,818,000 individuals, according to ''Live Births by Age and Mother and Race, 1933–98'', published by the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Brent |last=Green |title=Marketing to Leading-Edge Baby Boomers: Perceptions, Principles, Practices, Predictions |year=2006 |publisher=Paramount Market Publishing |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/marketingtoleadi0000gree_a7w2/page/4 4–5] |isbn=0976697351 |url=https://archive.org/details/marketingtoleadi0000gree_a7w2/page/4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. [[Landon Jones]], in his book ''Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation'' (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1946 through 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Landon Y. |title=How 'baby boomers' took over the world |url=https://www.lannyjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How-%E2%80%98baby-boomers%E2%80%99-took-over-the-world-The-Washington-Post.pdf |access-date=28 March 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=6 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328225337/https://www.lannyjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How-%E2%80%98baby-boomers%E2%80%99-took-over-the-world-The-Washington-Post.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]], in their 1991 book ''Generations'', define the social generation of boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the [[History of the United States (1945–1964)|postwar American High]] before [[John F.

However, he acknowledges that that is a demographic definition, and that culturally, it may not be as clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |title=By definition: Boom, bust, X and why |work=The Globe and Mail |date=June 24, 2006 |access-date=2010-08-27 |location=Toronto |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520180757/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |archive-date=May 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1946 to 1962, but that culturally boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owram1997xiv&quot;&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/gallery&gt;China's baby boom cohort is the largest in the world. According to journalist and photographer Howard French, who spent many years in China, many Chinese neighborhoods were, by the mid-2010s, disproportionately filled with the elderly, who the Chinese themselves referred to as a &quot;lost generation&quot; who grew up during the Cultural Revolution, when higher education was discouraged and large numbers of people were sent to the countryside for political reasons. As China's baby boomers retire in the late-2010s and onward, the people replacing in the workforce will be a much smaller cohort thanks to the one-child policy. Consequently, China's central government faces a stark economic trade-off between &quot;cane and butter&quot;—how much to spend on social welfare programs such as state pensions to support the elderly and how much to spend in the military to achieve the nation's geopolitical objectives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

A baby boom occurred in the aftermath of the Korean War, and the government subsequently encouraged people to have no more than two children per couple. As a result, South Korea's fertility has been falling ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;:302&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Haas|first=Benjamin|date=September 3, 2018|title=South Korea's fertility rate set to hit record low of 0.96|work=The Guardian|department=South Korea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/south-koreas-fertility-rate-set-to-hit-record-low|url-status=live|access-date=February 8, 2020|archive-date=April 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425184629/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/south-koreas-fertility-rate-set-to-hit-record-low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;From about 1750 to 1950, Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a &quot;correction,&quot; such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. Member states of the [[European Economic Community]] saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed. Falling fertility was due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].)&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|title=Whither the Child?

At the time of construction, contemporaries marveled at what technology was capable of, and the bridge became a symbol of the era's optimism. [[John Perry Barlow]] wrote in the late 20th century of the &quot;literal and genuinely religious leap of faith&quot; embodied in the bridge's construction, saying that the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge required of its builders faith in their ability to control technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/brooklyn_bridge.html |title=The View from the Brooklyn Bridge In response to &quot;The Five Imperatives for Electronic Trade&quot; |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=March 21, 1995 |access-date=March 22, 2016 |first=John Perry |last=Barlow| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810205924/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/brooklyn_bridge.html| archive-date=August 10, 2011| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
The Brooklyn Bridge has had an impact on idiomatic [[American English]]. For example, references to &quot;selling the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; abound in American culture, sometimes as examples of rural gullibility but more often in connection with an idea that strains credulity. [[George C. Parker]] and [[William McCloundy]] were two early 20th-century con men who had perpetrated this scam successfully on unwitting tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For You, Half Price |first=Gabriel |last=Cohen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/nyregion/thecity/27brid.html |newspaper=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331 |date=November 27, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tourist attraction, the Brooklyn Bridge is a popular site for clusters of [[love lock]]s, wherein a couple inscribes a date and their initials onto a lock, attach it to the bridge, and throw the key into the water as a sign of their love.

The Brooklyn Bridge has also been lauded for its architecture. One of the first positive reviews was &quot;The Bridge As A Monument&quot;, a ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' piece written by architecture critic [[Montgomery Schuyler]] and published a week after the bridge's opening. In the piece, Schuyler wrote: &quot;It so happens that the work which is likely to be our most durable monument, and to convey some knowledge of us to the most remote posterity, is a work of bare utility; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace, but a bridge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015020054360&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=315|title=The Bridge As A Monument|publisher=Harper's Magazine Company|year=1883|page=326|via=HathiTrust}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] cited the piece as the impetus for serious architectural criticism in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough pp. 548-549&quot; /&gt; He wrote that in the 1920s the bridge was a source of &quot;joy and inspiration&quot; in his childhood,&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough p. 550&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|McCullough|1972|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was a profound influence in his adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wojtowicz|first=Robert|date=1990|title=Lewis Mumford: The Architectural Critic as Historian|journal=Studies in the History of Art|volume=35|pages=237–249|issn=0091-7338|jstor=42620520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics would regard the Brooklyn Bridge as a work of art, as opposed to an engineering feat or a means of transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough p. 550&quot; /&gt; Not all critics appreciated the bridge, however. [[Henry James]], writing in the early 20th century, cited the bridge as an ominous symbol of the city's transformation into a &quot;steel-souled machine room&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough p. 550&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Haw|2005|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land for peace''' is a legalistic interpretation of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] which has been used as the basis of subsequent [[Arab]]-[[Israel]]i peace making. The name ''Land for Peace'' is derived from the wording of the resolution's first operative paragraph which affirms that peace should include the application of two principles: Withdrawal of Israeli forces (Giving Up Land), and Termination of all claims or states of belligerency (Making Peace). Since the resolution stipulates that both principles should apply, they can be viewed jointly as giving up land for peace, referred to more concisely as 'land for peace'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ROlQUFZIpoC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA308&amp;ots=wkdYnYlBAq&amp;pg=RA1-PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The United Nations Security Council ]&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation is widely contested because it implies that Israeli withdrawal is linked to its neighbours' willingness to formally make peace. Competing interpretations of the resolution regard Israel as being obligated to withdraw unilaterally from all territories captured in 1967. Operative paragraph 1 of Resolution 242 reads as follows:

:1. Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the [[Middle East]] which should include the application of both the following principles:
:::		(i) Withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;

:::		(ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force;

In 1976, when [[Lord Caradon]] was asked about the concessions the Arab states would have to make to Israel as part of an overall settlement, he said &quot;Well, that's perfectly obvious if you read again the principles of 242, which have been accepted by Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, and in effect by Israel. The provision is that if there is an adequate withdrawal, all states in the area must be free to live within secure and recognized boundaries, free from force and threat of force. So it is an acceptance that Israel has a right to exist, just as they would have  a right to their homeland, and have a right to exist. This is the essential bargain that we are proposing. It's not a new thing, it's been going since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lord Caradon, ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 5, No. 3/4 (Spring – Summer, 1976), page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 1967, Israel offered &quot;to give up Sinai and the Golan in exchange for peace,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/346|title=Righteous victims : a history of the Zionist-Arab conflict, 1881–1999|last=Morris|first=Benny|date=|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2001|isbn=9780679744757|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/righteousvictims00morr_0/page/346 346]|oclc=234104996|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; an offer that was rejected in September 1967 by the Arab States by the [[Khartoum Resolution]], which became famous for the &quot;Three No's&quot;: &quot;no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-In-History-The-Arab-Leagues-three-nos|title=This Week in History: The Arab League Three No's|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first application of the land for peace formula was [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Israel's peace treaty with Egypt]] in 1979,{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} under which Israel withdrew from the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] as part of a comprehensive peace agreement facilitated by economic assistance to both sides from the United States.

In 1994 a similar comprehensive agreement invoking resolution 242{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} formed the basis of the Israel Jordan peace treaty whereby both sides redeployed to their respective sides of the agreed international boundary.

'''Gloucestershire''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-gloucestershire.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɒ|s|t|ər|ʃ|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=gloucestershire.ogg|-|ʃ|ɪər}}; abbreviated '''Glos.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Abbreviations|url=https://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/abbreviations/|access-date=2020-06-28|website=Oxford English Dictionary|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Swydd Gaerloyw) is a [[Counties of England|county]] in [[South West England]]. The county comprises part of the [[Cotswold Hills]], part of the flat fertile valley of the [[River Severn]], and the entire [[Forest of Dean]].

The [[county town]] is the [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Gloucester]], and other principal towns include [[Cheltenham]], [[Stroud]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Cirencester]], [[Dursley]], [[Cinderford]], and [[Lydney]].

Gloucestershire borders [[Herefordshire]] to the north west, [[Wiltshire]] to the south, [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]] to the south west, [[Worcestershire]] to the north, [[Oxfordshire]] to the east, [[Warwickshire]] to the north east, and the [[Wales|Welsh]] county of [[Monmouthshire]] to the west.

The current [[Gloucestershire County Council]] area does not have the same geographical boundaries as the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]]. Some northern parts of the county, including [[Long Marston, Warwickshire|Long Marston]] and [[Welford-on-Avon]], were transferred to Warwickshire in 1931. Following the [[Local Government Act 1972]], some southern parts of the county were transferred to the new county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]], which ceased to exist on 1 April 1996. After 1996, the city of [[Bristol]] and [[South Gloucestershire]] became separate [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Gloucestershire}}
Gloucestershire is a historic county mentioned in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in the 10th century, though the areas of [[Winchcombe]] and the [[Forest of Dean]] were not added until the late 11th century. Gloucestershire originally included Bristol, then a small town. The local rural community moved to the port city (as Bristol was to become), and Bristol's population growth accelerated during the industrial revolution. Bristol became a county in its own right, separate from Gloucestershire and Somerset in 1373. It later became part of the administrative [[County of Avon]] from 1974 to 1996.

Upon the abolition of Avon in 1996, the region north of Bristol became a [[unitary authority]] area of [[South Gloucestershire]] and is now part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Gloucestershire.

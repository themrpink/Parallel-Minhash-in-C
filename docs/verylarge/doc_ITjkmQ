In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Åkerfeldt|first=Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter4.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205072405/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter4.html |archive-date=February 5, 2008 |title=Opeth Chapter 4 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''Eternal'' members, drummer [[Martin Lopez|Martín López]] (formerly of [[Amon Amarth]]) and bassist [[Martín Méndez]], responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKm2eQ7XftM|title=Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKm2eQ7XftM#t=527|title=Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|work=YouTube|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of [[Iron Maiden]]'s &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;, which was included on the album ''[[A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Call to Irons&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Hundey, Jason |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r346670|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music ''A Call to Irons'' Review |website=Allmusic.com |accessdate=March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer [[Fredrik Nordström]], at [[Studio Fredman]] in August 1997. Although Opeth had Méndez, due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=McCoe, Scott |url=http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewopeth.html |title=Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt |publisher=Metalupdate.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Arms, Your Hearse]]'' was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Bio&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label [[Peaceville Records]] in Europe, which was distributed by [[Music for Nations]]. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;/&gt; Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and ''[[Still Life (Opeth album)|Still Life]]'' was released on October 18, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;/&gt; Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. ''Still Life'' was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/logo_01.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040221013513/http://www.opeth.com/biography/logo_01.html| archive-date=February 21, 2004| title=Current logo | publisher=Opeth.com | accessdate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allmusic called ''Still Life'' a &quot;formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r521354|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Still Life'' review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Åkerfeldt, ''Still Life'' is a [[concept album]]: &quot;The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCoe&quot;/&gt;

Following a few live dates in Europe, Opeth returned to [[Studio Fredman]] to begin work on its next album, with [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]] producing. The band sought to recreate the recording experience of ''Still Life'', and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals, and no lyrics written. &quot;This time it was tough,&quot; Åkerfeldt said, &quot;I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205072409/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archive-date=February 5, 2008 |title=Opeth Chapter 5 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound, incorporating new sounds and production techniques. &quot;Steve guided us into the realms of 'strange' noises for guitars and voice&quot;, Åkerfeldt said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;/&gt;

Opeth released its fifth studio album, ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', on February 21, 2001. AllMusic has stated that the album &quot;keeps with Opeth's tradition by transcending the limits of death/black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BWPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last= Rivadavia |first= Eduardo |title=''Blackwater Park'' review |website= [[AllMusic]] |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r517973|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate= June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Blackwater Park'', Opeth embarked on its first world tour, headlined Europe for the first time, and made an appearance at the 2001 [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in Germany, playing to a crowd of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-history/woa-2001/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324192603/http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-history/woa-2001/| archive-date=March 24, 2008|title=History of Wacken Open Air 2001 |publisher=Wacken.com |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth returned to Sweden after touring in support of ''Blackwater Park'', and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: &quot;I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't want to go to waste.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter7.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231032512/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter7.html |archive-date=December 31, 2007 |title=Opeth Chapter 7 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Renkse]] of [[Katatonia]], a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt;

Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without consulting his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: &quot;I had to lie somewhat&amp;nbsp;... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;/&gt; With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was &quot;the toughest test of our history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://opeth.com/biography/chapter8.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205072419/http://opeth.com/biography/chapter8.html |archive-date=February 5, 2008 |title=Opeth Chapter 8 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, ''[[Deliverance (Opeth album)|Deliverance]]'', with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. &quot;''Deliverance'' was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever,&quot; Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap &quot;is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot; /&gt;

''Deliverance'' was released on November 4, 2002, and debuted at number&amp;nbsp;19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band's first US chart appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=opeth|chart=Independent Albums}} |title=Artist Chart History – Opeth |publisher=[[Billboard charts|Billboard.com]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; AllMusic stated, &quot;''Deliverance'' is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r614742|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Deliverance'' review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth performed a one-off concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, ''[[Damnation (album)|Damnation]]'', at Steven Wilson's No Man's Land Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=6471 |title=Opeth finalize track listing, cover artwork for ''Deliverance'' |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=September 29, 2002 |accessdate=February 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021027114126/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=6471|archive-date=October 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Åkerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation'' in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on ''Blackwater Park'' alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;/&gt; ''Damnation'' was released on April 14, 2003, and garnered the band its first appearance on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 192.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt; The album also won the 2003 Swedish [[Grammy]] Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeth-win-swedish-grammy/|title=Opeth win Swedish Grammy! |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=March 6, 2008|date=February 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2016, Opeth re-released both ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation'' in one package, containing CD and DVD versions, along with new mixing.

The band embarked on its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200&amp;nbsp;shows in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;/&gt; Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each—one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first DVD, ''[[Lamentations (Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003)]]'', at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London, England. The DVD features a two-hour performance, including the entire ''Damnation'' album, several songs from ''Deliverance'' and ''Blackwater Park'', and a one-hour documentary about the recording of ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation''. ''Lamentations'' was certified [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|Gold]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIA Searchable Database |url=http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php |publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] |accessdate=February 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412081617/http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php |archive-date=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth was scheduled to perform in [[Jordan]] without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an [[anxiety attack]] and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPETH Mainman Talks About Drummer's Anxiety Attacks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Opeth Mainman Talks About Drummer's Anxiety Attacks |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=March 10, 2005 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=20205 |accessdate=March 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101093559/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=20205 |archive-date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 9&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Åkerfeldt |first=Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter9.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116165815/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter9.html |archive-date=January 16, 2008 |title=Opeth Chapter 9 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour.

Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation'' tour.

In 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, &quot;The Throat of Winter&quot;, which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, ''[[God of War III]]''.

{{Main|Heritage (Opeth album)}}

[[File:Opeth - Kavarna Rock Fest 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Opeth at [[Kavarna Rock Fest]] 2011]]

In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/opeth-porcupine-tree-mainmen-work-together |title=Opeth Exclusive: See Special Live Video Clip |publisher=Classic Rock Magazine |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910002120/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/opeth-porcupine-tree-mainmen-work-together/ |archive-date=September 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with [[Jens Bogren]] (engineering) and [[Steven Wilson]] from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opeth.com/index.php/news/show/id/195 |title=Opeth to enter studio in January 2011! |publisher=Opeth.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101111337/http://opeth.com/index.php/news/show/id/195 |archive-date=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band.&lt;ref name=PerW&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Opeth-Part-Ways-With--Keyboardist-Per-Wiberg-22880.aspx |title=Opeth Part Ways With Keyboardist Per Wiberg |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411235009/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Opeth-Part-Ways-With--Keyboardist-Per-Wiberg-22880.aspx |archive-date=April 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, &quot;Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.&quot;&lt;ref name=PerW/&gt;

Opeth's tenth album, ''[[Heritage (Opeth album)|Heritage]]'', was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/heritage/critic-reviews|title=Heritage|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart.&lt;ref name=goallin&gt;{{cite news|title=Opeth's Mikael Åkerfeldt On Next Album: It's Time To Go 'All In' With String Instrumentation|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeths-mikael-akerfeldt-on-next-album-its-time-to-go-all-in-with-string-instrumentation/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heritage'' debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&amp;search=Opeth |title=Swedish charts portal - Opeth: Album |publisher=Hung Medien |language=sv |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Heritage'' became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more [[progressive metal|progressive]] style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowar|first=Chad|title=Opeth Interview: A Conversation with Vocalist/Guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Opeth-Interview.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=15 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106192605/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Opeth-Interview.htm|archive-date=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for ''Heritage'' were in the style of ''[[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]]''. After hearing the songs for the first time, [[Martín Méndez]] told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction.&lt;ref name=Faceculture&gt;{{cite web|title=Face Culture|publisher=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v2pMSu7EUI |date=15 July 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style.&lt;ref name=Faceculture /&gt; In the press release for ''Heritage'', Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeth-heritage-album-details-revealed/ |title=OPETH: 'Heritage' Album Details Revealed |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for [[Allmusic]], Thom Jurek called ''Heritage'' the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as &quot;drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/heritage-mw0002193946 |title=Heritage - Opeth| website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled ''[[Pale Communion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/opeth-pale-communion-20140408|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|title=Opeth's &quot;Pale Communion&quot; Coming June 17|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeths-pale-communion-pushed-back-to-august/|title=OPETH's 'Pale Communion' Pushed Back To August|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Åkerfeldt began working on new material as far back as August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=17546 |title=Opeth - Mikael Åkerfeldt Writing New Material |publisher=Metalstorm.net |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143308/http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=17546 |archive-date=March 22, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 he stated, &quot;We've been looking at [tracking the next album at] [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales where [[Queen (band)|Queen]] recorded &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past.&quot;&lt;ref name=goallin /&gt; Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase,&lt;ref name=splittingfanbase&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/opeth_feared_splitting_fanbase_with_heritage.html?no_takeover |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |title=Opeth Feared Splitting Fanbase With Heritage |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than ''Heritage'', Åkerfeldt said, &quot;Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs.&quot; Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include [[string instrument]]ation, something that he became interested in doing when working on ''[[Storm Corrosion (album)|Storm Corrosion]]''.&lt;ref name=goallin /&gt; The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating ''Heritage'' which resulted in closer relationships between them.&lt;ref name=rejuvenated&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeths-pale-communion-cracks-u-s-top-20/ |title=Opeth's ''Pale Communion'' Cracks U.S. Top 20 |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 3, 2014 |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reviewed ''Pale Communion'' positively, calling it &quot;strange, intricate prog-metal genius&quot; somewhat flawed by Åkerfeldt's indulgent vocal styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/21/opeth-pale-communion-review |date=21 August 2014 |title=Opeth: Pale Communion review – strange, intricate prog-metal genius |last=Lawson |first=Dom |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album saw Opeth's highest chart positions in the history of the band with ''Pale Communion'' debuting at number 19 in the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; number 3 in Sweden,&lt;ref name=&quot;SWE&quot; /&gt; and number 14 in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKcharts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tobias|last=Zywietz|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_O.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: The O – Ozric Tentacles|publisher=Zobbel|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.&lt;ref name=rejuvenated /&gt;

''Pale Communion'' was supported with more touring from Opeth. In 2015, Opeth played several concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band. At these special shows, the band was doing two sets. The first set is 2005's ''[[Ghost Reveries]]'' as a ten-year anniversary celebration of the album. The second set spanned the rest of the band's career, celebrating their 25th anniversary.&lt;ref name=anniversary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opeth.com/home/news/item/229-25th-anniversary-concert-announced |title=25th Anniversary Concert Announced |publisher=Opeth.com |date=November 12, 2014 |accessdate=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518233053/http://www.opeth.com/home/news/item/229-25th-anniversary-concert-announced |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opeth.com/home/news/item/233-new-york-la-25th-anniversary-shows-announced |title=New York &amp; LA 25th Anniversary Shows Announced |publisher=Opeth.com |date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518233050/http://www.opeth.com/home/news/item/233-new-york-la-25th-anniversary-shows-announced |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Åkerfeldt expressed excitement for the concerts.&lt;ref name=anniversary /&gt;

Just the way we like it.&quot; The album was the first project under Moderbolaget Records, a joint venture between Opeth and Nuclear Blast. Moderbolaget means &quot;the parent company&quot; in Swedish.

On July 25, 2016, in the build up towards the album release, the band posted the first Sorceress: Studio Report on their YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olffy8UPwbo|title=OPETH - Sorceress: Studio Report - Episode 1: Rockfield Studios (OFFICIAL TRAILER)|date=July 22, 2016|website=Opeth Youtube Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the behind-the-scenes studio tour, it is confirmed that the band had returned to Rockfield Studios where they previously recorded ''Pale Communion''.

On August 1, 2016, the band released a lyric video for the title-track 'Sorceress' on their YouTube channel.

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s [[progressive rock]] bands [[King Crimson]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Camel (band)|Camel]], [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|P.F.M.]], [[Hawkwind]], and [[Gracious!|Gracious]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&amp;pg=PA293 |page=293 |last=Wagner |first=Jeff |title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |year=2010 |isbn=9780979616334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by heavy metal bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[King Diamond]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110 |page=110 |last=Wagner |first=Jeff |title=Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |year=2010 |isbn=9780979616334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most importantly, [[Judas Priest]]. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot; from Judas Priest's third album ''[[Sin After Sin]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name=&quot;chroniclesofchaos1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Azevedo, Pedro |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-176_opeth.aspx |title=Born Within Sorrow's Mask |publisher=Chroniclesofchaos.com |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218122009/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-176_opeth.aspx |archive-date=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MA influences&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=February 24, 2006 |url=http://wnhumetal.com/radio/content/view/110/38/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126222900/http://wnhumetal.com/radio/content/view/110/38/ |archive-date=January 26, 2008 |title=Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt or Opeth |publisher=Wnhumetal.com |accessdate=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;When it Rains it Pours&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hailmetal.com/gate.html?name=MReviews&amp;op=show&amp;rid=83|title=Opeth: Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt|date=December 28, 2004|publisher=HailMetal.com|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and [[folk music]], both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p214051|pure_url=yes}} |title=Opeth overview |website=Allmusic |accessdate=January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Opeth frontman on being 'different' |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=October 30, 2006 |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/?id=45633 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115214331/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/?id=45633 |archive-date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, Opeth have abandoned their death metal sound resulting in a mellower progressive rock sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15866-heritage/ |title=Opeth - ''Heritage'' |author=Brandon Stosuy |date=September 17, 2011 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When talking about ''[[Heritage (Opeth album)|Heritage]]'', guitarist [[Fredrik Åkesson]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done ''Heritage''. I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think ''Heritage'' is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.&lt;ref name=splittingfanbase /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vocally, Åkerfeldt shifts between traditional [[Death growl|death metal vocals]] for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered or soft-spoken vocals over mellower passages. While his death growls were dominant on early releases, later efforts incorporate more clean vocals, with ''Damnation'', ''Heritage'', ''Pale Communion'', ''Sorceress'' and ''In Cauda Venenum'' featuring only clean singing.&lt;ref name=&quot;When it Rains it Pours&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/opeth-member-understands-frustration-at-lack-of-death-growls-in-new-material/|title=Opeth member understands frustration at lack of death growls in new material|website=Tone Deaf|last=Belling|first=Alasdair|date=January 20, 2020|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivadavia noted that &quot;Åkerfeldt's vocals run the gamut from bowel-churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty—depending on each movement section's mood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BWPR&quot;/&gt;

Personally I like the &quot;two&quot; Opeth, and I'm glad to see that he does not look around him to make the music he really likes, he's a real musician who listens to his heart.) | title = Simone Simons, chanteuse d'Epica | date = 19 February 2012 | author = Ju de Melon }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Palotai]] of [[Kamelot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 19 February 2017 | url = http://www.progwereld.org/cms/kamelot-%E2%80%93-interview-met-oliver-palotai-en-thomas-youngblood-nav-hun-nieuwe-album-%E2%80%9Chaven%E2%80%9D/ | title = Kamelot – Interview met Oliver Palotai en Thomas Youngblood nav hun nieuwe album &quot;Haven&quot; | first = Mario | last = van Os | website = Progwereld.org | language = nl | location = [[Amsterdam]] | quote = Mijn favoriete band is waarschijnlijk Opeth.

'''Charles Ponzi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|z|i}}, {{IPA-it|ˈpontsi|lang}}; born '''Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi'''; March 3, 1882 – January 18, 1949) was an [[Italians|Italian]] swindler and [[Confidence trick|con artist]] in the U.S. and Canada. His aliases include ''Charles Ponci'', ''Carlo'', and ''Charles P. Bianchi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=1931-01-05 |title=Business &amp; Finance: Ponzi Payment |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930255,00.html |magazine=Time |language=en-US |issn=0040-781X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623060130/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930255,00.html |archive-date=2011-06-23 |access-date=2013-07-16 |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted [[International reply coupon|postal reply coupons]] in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the U.S. as a form of [[arbitrage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1|q=In 1920 thousands of gullibles had a more naked picture of him.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a &quot;[[Ponzi scheme]].&quot; His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his &quot;investors&quot; $20 million.

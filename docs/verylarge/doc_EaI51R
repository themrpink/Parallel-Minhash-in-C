The [[vasodilatation]] caused by [[sodium nitroprusside]] has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to [[nitroglycerine]] and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith RP, Kruszyna H |title=Toxicology of some inorganic antihypertensive anions.|journal=Fed Proc.|date=Jan 1976|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–72|pmid=1245233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HCN and the origin of life===
Hydrogen cyanide has been discussed as a precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids, and is proposed to have played a part in the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Matthews, C.

HCN is formed in [[Interstellar medium|interstellar]] clouds through one of two major pathways:&lt;ref name=&quot;Boger, G. I. and Sternberg, A. 2005 302&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = CN and HCN in Dense Interstellar Clouds |author1=Boger, G.

The dissociative recombination pathway is dominant by 30%; however, the [[HCNH+|HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] must be in its linear form. Dissociative recombination with its structural isomer, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, exclusively produces [[hydrogen isocyanide]] (HNC).

HCN is destroyed in interstellar clouds through a number of mechanisms depending on the location in the cloud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boger, G. I. and Sternberg, A. 2005 302&quot; /&gt; In  [[photon-dominated region]]s (PDRs), photodissociation dominates, producing [[Cyanide|CN]] (HCN + ν → CN + H). At further depths, photodissociation by cosmic rays dominate, producing CN (HCN + cr → CN + H). In the dark core, two competing mechanisms destroy it, forming HCN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (HCN + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HCN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H; HCN + HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HCNH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO). The reaction with HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dominates by a factor of ~3.5. HCN has been used to analyze a variety of species and processes in the interstellar medium. It has been suggested as a tracer for dense molecular gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gao, Y. |author2=Solomon, P.

==As a poison and chemical weapon==
{{main|Cyanide poisoning}}
In [[World War I]], hydrogen cyanide was used as a chemical weapon against the Central Powers by the French from 1916, and by the United States and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in 1918, but it was not found to be effective enough due to weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Schnedlitz, Markus (2008) ''Chemische Kampfstoffe: Geschichte, Eigenschaften, Wirkung''. GRIN Verlag. p. 13. {{ISBN|364023360-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm Weapons of War - Poison Gas]. firstworldwar.com&lt;/ref&gt; The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere; this is in contrast to denser agents such as [[phosgene]] or [[chlorine]] which tend to remain at ground level and sink into the [[trench warfare|trenches]] of the Western Front's battlefields. Compared to such agents it must also be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal. These properties combine to make its use in the field impractical. A hydrogen cyanide concentration in the range of 100–200 ppm in air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyanidecode1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php Environmental and Health Effects]. Cyanidecode.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (about 2380&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) will kill a human in about one minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyanidecode1&quot;/&gt; The toxicity is caused by the cyanide ion, which halts [[cellular respiration]] by acting as a [[non-competitive inhibitor]] for an enzyme in mitochondria called [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. As such, hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among [[chemical weapons]] as a [[blood agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/blood-agents/hydrogen-cyanide/ | title = Hydrogen Cyanide | publisher = Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons | accessdate = 2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed under [[List of Schedule 3 substances (CWC)|Schedule 3]] of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses, manufacturing plants in signatory countries which produce more than 30 metric tons per year must be declared to, and can be inspected by, the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]].

Hydrogen cyanide has been absorbed into a carrier for use as a pesticide. Perhaps the most infamous of these is {{lang|de|[[Zyklon B]]}} (German: ''Cyclone B'', with the '''B''' standing for {{lang|de|Blausäure}} – prussic acid; also, to distinguish it from an earlier product later known as Zyklon A),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Dwork, D. | author2 = van Pelt, R.

Hydrogen cyanide was also used in the camps for delousing clothing in attempts to eradicate diseases carried by lice and other parasites. One of the original Czech producers continued making Zyklon B under the trademark &quot;Uragan D2&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.draslovka.cz/about-us#products | title = BLUE FUME | publisher = Chemical Factory Draslovka a.s. | accessdate = 2020-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until recently.{{when|date=October 2020}} Hydrogen cyanide was also the agent employed in judicial [[Capital punishment in the United States|execution]] in some [[U.S. state]]s, where it was produced during the execution by the action of [[sulfuric acid]] on [[Sodium cyanide|sodium]] or [[potassium cyanide]].

Under the name ''prussic acid'', HCN has been used as a killing agent in [[whaling]] harpoons, although it proved quite dangerous to the crew deploying it, and thus it was quickly abandoned.&lt;ref name=irons/&gt; From the middle of the 18th century it was used in a number of poisoning murders and suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/prunus_laurocerasus.htm|title=The Poison Garden website|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potassium ferrocyanide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with formula K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is the potassium salt of the [[complex (chemistry)|coordination complex]] [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;. This salt forms lemon-yellow [[monoclinic]] [[crystal]]s.

==Synthesis==

In 1752, the French chemist [[Pierre Macquer|Pierre Joseph Macquer]] (1718–1784) first reported the preparation of potassium ferrocyanide, which he achieved by reacting [[Prussian blue]] (iron(III) ferrocyanide) with [[potassium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macquer |title=Éxamen chymique de bleu de Prusse |journal=Histoire de l'Académie royale des sciences … , § Mémoires de l'Académie royale des Sciences |date=1752 |pages=60–77 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88112#page/250/mode/1up |trans-title=Chemical examination of Prussian blue |language=French}} 
 From pp. 63-64:  ''&quot;Après avoir essayé ainsi inutilement de décomposer le bleu de Prusse par les acides, … n'avoit plus qu'une couleur jaune un peu rousse.&quot;''  (After having tried so vainly to decompose Prussian blue by acids, I made recourse to alkalies.  I put a half ounce of this [Prussian] blue in a flask, and I poured on it ten ounces of a solution of nitre fixed by tartar [i.e., [[potassium nitrate]] (''nitre'') which is mixed with crude [[potassium bitartrate|cream of tartar]] and then ignited, producing potassium carbonate].  As soon as these two substances had been mixed together, I saw with astonishment that, without the aid of heat, the blue color had entirely disappeared; the powder [i.e., precipitate] at the bottom of the flask had only a rather gray color:  having put this vessel on a [[sand bath]] in order to heat the solution until it simmered, this gray color also disappeared entirely, and all that was contained in the flask, both the powder [i.e., precipitate] and the solution, had only a yellow color [that was] a little red.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munroe |first1=Charles E. |last2=Chatard |first2=Thomas M. |title=Manufactures: Chemicals and Allied Products |journal=Twelfth Census of the United States: Bulletins |date=1902 |issue=210 |pages=1–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UIUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA31}}; see p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern production===
Potassium ferrocyanide is produced industrially from [[hydrogen cyanide]],  [[ferrous chloride]], and [[calcium hydroxide]], the combination of which affords Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]·11H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  This solution is then treated with potassium salts to precipitate the mixed calcium-potassium salt CaK&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], which in turn is treated with [[potassium carbonate]] to give the tetrapotassium salt.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ cite encyclopedia |author1=Gail, E. |author2=Gos, S. |author3=Kulzer, R. |author4=Lorösch, J. |author5=Rubo, A. |author6=Sauer, M. |author7=Kellens, R. |author8=Reddy, J. |author9=Steier, N. |author10=Hasenpusch, W. | title = Cyano Compounds, Inorganic | encyclopedia = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=October 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a08_159.pub3 |isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical production===
Historically, the compound was manufactured from organic compounds containing nitrogen, iron filings, and potassium carbonate.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Wagner|first=Rudolf|title=Manual of chemical technology|year=1897|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co.|location=New York|page=474 &amp; 477|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3tt4gz1p;view=1up;seq=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] sources were [[torrefaction|torrified]] horn, leather scrap, [[offal]], or dried blood.

==Chemical reactions==
Treatment of potassium ferrocyanide with nitric acid gives H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(NO)(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;].  After neutralization of this intermediate with sodium carbonate, red crystals of [[sodium nitroprusside]] can be selectively crystallized.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite encyclopedia | author = Seel, F. | title = Sodium Nitrosyl Cyanoferrate | encyclopedia = Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry | edition = 2nd | editor = Brauer, G. | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1965 | location = New York | volume = 2 | page = 1768 | lccn = 63-14307 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/27443280/Handbook-of-Preparative-Inorganic-Chemistry-Vol-2-2d-Ed-George-Brauer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon treatment with [[chlorine]] gas, potassium ferrocyanide converts to [[potassium ferricyanide]]:
:2 K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] + 2 KCl
This reaction can be used to remove potassium ferrocyanide from a solution.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A famous reaction involves treatment with ferric salts to give [[Prussian blue]].  With the approximate composition KFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, this insoluble but deeply coloured material is the blue of [[blueprint]]ing.

==Applications==
Potassium ferrocyanide finds many niche applications in industry.  It and [[Sodium ferrocyanide|the related sodium salt]] are widely used as anticaking agents for both road salt and table salt. The potassium and sodium ferrocyanides are also used in the purification of tin and the separation of copper from molybdenum ores.  Potassium ferrocyanide is used in the production of wine and citric acid.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

In the EU, ferrocyanides (E 535–538) were, as of 2018, solely authorised in two food categories as salt substitutes. Kidneys are the organ for ferrocyanide toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peter Aggett, Fernando Aguilar, Riccardo Crebelli, Birgit Dusemund, Metka Filipič, Maria Jose Frutos, Pierre Galtier, David Gott, Ursula Gundert‐Remy, Gunter Georg Kuhnle, Claude Lambré, Jean‐Charles Leblanc, Inger Therese Lillegaard, Peter Moldeus, Alicja Mortensen, Agneta Oskarsson, Ivan Stankovic, Ine Waalkens‐Berendsen, Rudolf Antonius Woutersen, Matthew Wright and Maged Younes. |title=Re‐evaluation of sodium ferrocyanide (E 535), potassium ferrocyanide (E 536) and calcium ferrocyanide (E 538) as food additives |journal=EFSA Journal |date=2018 |volume=16 |issue=7 |page=5374 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5374 |pmid=32626000 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5374|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be used in animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EuSalt Expert Meeting on E 535 and E 536 as Feed Additives |url=https://eusalt.com/events/eusalt-expert-meeting-e-535-and-e-536-feed-additives |publisher=EUSalt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, potassium ferrocyanide is used to determine the concentration of [[potassium permanganate]], a compound often used in [[titration]]s based on [[redox]] reactions.  Potassium ferrocyanide is used in a mixture with potassium ferricyanide and phosphate buffered solution to provide a buffer for [[beta-galactosidase]], which is used to cleave [[X-Gal]], giving a bright blue visualization where an antibody (or other molecule), conjugated to Beta-gal, has bonded to its target. On reacting with Fe(3) it gives a Prussian blue colour. Thus it is used as an identifying reagent for iron in labs.

Potassium ferrocyanide can be used as a fertilizer for plants.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Prior to 1900 [[Anno Domini|AD]], before the invention of the [[Castner process]], potassium ferrocyanide was the most important source of [[alkali metal]] [[Sodium cyanide|cyanides]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt; In this historical process, [[potassium cyanide]] was produced by decomposing potassium ferrocyanide:&lt;ref name=Wagner /&gt;

K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] → 4 KCN + FeC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Structure==
Like other metal cyanides, solid potassium ferrocyanide, both as the hydrate and anhydrous salts, has a complicated polymeric structure.  The polymer consists of octahedral [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; centers crosslinked with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions that are bound to the CN [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Willans, M.J.; Wasylishen, R.E.; McDonald, R. &quot;Polymorphism of potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate as studied by solid-state multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction&quot; Inorganic Chemistry 2009, volume 48, p4342-4353&lt;/ref&gt;  The K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;---NC linkages break when the solid is dissolved in water.{{clarification needed|date=May 2020}}{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Toxicity===
Potassium ferrocyanide is nontoxic, and is not decomposed to cyanide in the body. The toxicity in rats is low, with [[lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) at 6400&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=JTBaker&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5763.htm | title = POTASSIUM FERROCYANIDE MSDS Number: P5763 - Effective Date: 12/08/96 | publisher = J.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic cod is one of three cod species in the genus ''[[Gadus]] ''along with [[Pacific cod]] and [[Greenland cod]]. A variety of fish species are colloquially known as cod, but they are not all classified within the ''Gadus'', though some are in the Atlantic cod family, [[Gadidae]].

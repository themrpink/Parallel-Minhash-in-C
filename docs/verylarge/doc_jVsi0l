Insects of the large order [[Diptera]] (flies) have halteres which evolved from a pair of ancestral [[hindwing]]s, while males of the much smaller order [[Strepsiptera]] (stylops)&lt;ref name=&quot;MW&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster: stylops broadly: an insect of the order Strepsiptera |[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stylops]&lt;/ref&gt; have halteres which evolved from a pair of ancestral [[forewing]]s.

==Background==

The majority of insects have two pairs of wings. Flies possess only one set of lift-generating wings and one set of halteres. The order name for flies, &quot;Diptera&quot;, literally means &quot;two wings&quot;, but there is another order of insect which has evolved flight with only two wings: [[strepsiptera]]ns, or stylops;&lt;ref name=&quot;MW&quot;/&gt; they are the only other organisms that possess two wings and two halteres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pix 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pix|first1=W|last2=Nalbach|first2=G|last3=Zeil|first3=J|title=Strepsipteran Forewings Are Haltere-Like Organs of Equilibrium|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=1993|volume=80|issue=8|pages=371–374|doi=10.1007/bf01138795}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strepsipterans have adapted their forewings into halteres, whereas dipterans have adapted their hindwings into halteres. This unique structure which detects rotations/perturbations during flight has never been described in nature elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Flight dynamics with text.png|thumb|220px|Directions of rotation]]

Halteres are able to sense small deviations in body position using the [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] properties of moving mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt; What this means is that halteres beat up and down in time with the flapping of the wings along a linear pathway, but when the fly's body begins to rotate, the path of the beating halteres also changes. Now, instead of the halteres following a linear path, they begin to follow a curved path. The larger the perturbation they experience, the farther the halteres move from their original linear path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraenkel 1938&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FRAENKEL|first1=G.|last2=PRINGLE|first2=J. W. S.|title=Biological Sciences: Halteres of Flies as Gyroscopic Organs of Equilibrium|journal=Nature|date=21 May 1938|volume=141|issue=3577|pages=919–920|doi=10.1038/141919a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these periods, the haltere is no longer moving in only two directions (up and down), but four (up, down, left, and right). The force exerted on the halteres in response to this left right movement is known as [[coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] and can be produced when any moving object is rotated in the three directions of [[rotation]], yaw, pitch or roll (see figure). When this occurs, tiny bell-shaped structures at the base of the haltere experience strain as the haltere stalk bends in their direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraenkel 1938&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nalbach 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nalbach|first1=G.|title=The halteres of the blowfly Calliphora|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1993|issue=173|pages=293–300|doi=10.1007/BF00191842|volume=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nervous system]] can then transform the bending of these hairs into electrical signals, which the fly interprets as body rotation information. The fly uses this information to make corrections to its position and thereby restabilizes itself during flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt; Further details explaining the dynamics and physiology of halteres are described below.

Halteres are typically only associated with flight stabilization, but their ability to detect body rotations can elicit compensatory reactions not only from the wing steering muscles, but also from neck muscle which are responsible for head position and gaze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hengstenberg 1988&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hengstenberg|first1=R.|last2=Sandeman|first2=D. C.|last3=Hengstenberg|first3=B.|title=Compensatory Head Roll in the Blowfly Calliphora during Flight|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B |date=22 May 1986|volume=227|issue=1249|pages=455–482|doi=10.1098/rspb.1986.0034|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0013-EFCF-0|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halteres may also be useful for other behaviors. Certain species of flies have been observed to oscillate their halteres while walking in addition to oscillating them during flight. In these individuals, halteres could thus be detecting sensory information during walking behavior as well. When the halteres are removed, these insects perform more poorly at certain walking challenges. However, how haltere information is processed and used during walking remains, with few exceptions, unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2015&quot; /&gt; Specific examples of what has been found are described below.

==History==
Halteres were first documented by [[William Derham]] in 1714. He discovered that flies were unable to remain airborne when their halteres were surgically removed, but otherwise behaved normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derham|first1=William|title=haltere|date=1714|publisher=Physico-Theology|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was initially attributed to the haltere's ability to sense and maintain equilibrium. In 1917 v. Buddenbrock asserted that something else was responsible for the flies' loss of flight ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budd 1919&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=v. Buddenbrock|first1=W|title=haltere|journal=Pflügers Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie|date=1919|volume=175|issue=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the halteres should instead be considered &quot;stimulation organs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Budd 1919&quot;/&gt; In other words, that the activity of the halteres energized the wing muscular system, so that they acted as an on/off switch for flight. V. Buddenbrock attempted to show that activation of the halteres would stimulate the central nervous system into a state of activity which allowed the wings to produce flight behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budd 1919&quot;/&gt; It has since been concluded that this is not in fact true, and that the original assertion that halteres act as balance organs is the correct one. V. Buddenbrock was able to show that immediately after haltere removal flies were unable to produce normal wing movements. This was later explained by the fact that allowing flies a few minutes recovery time post-surgery resulted in total recovery of normal flight muscle control. Further, in an interesting side experiment performed by Pringle (1938), when a thread was attached to the abdomen of haltereless flies, relatively stable flight was again achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraenkel 1938&quot;/&gt; The thread in these experiments presumably aided in keeping the fly from rotating (similar to the way a heavy basket below a [[hot air balloon]] prevents the balloon from tipping), which supported the hypothesis that halteres are responsible for sensing body rotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt;

The original balancer theory, which was postulated by Pringle (1948), only accounted for forces produced in two directions. Pringle claimed that yaw was the only direction of rotation that flies used their halteres to detect. Using high speed video analysis, Faust (1952) demonstrated that this was not the case and that halteres are capable of detecting all three directions of rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faust 1952&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=R.|title=Untersuchungen zum halterenproblem|journal=Zool Jahrb Physiol|date=1952|volume=63|pages=352–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this new discovery, Pringle reexamined his previous assumption and came to the conclusion that flies were capable of detecting all three directions of rotation simply by comparing inputs from the left and right sides of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1957&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pringle|first1=J. W. S.|title=Insect flight|date=1957|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this is not the actual mechanism by which flies detect rotation. Different fields of sensory organs located in different regions at the base of each haltere detect the different directions of rotation, which also explains why flies with one haltere are still able to fly without issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nalbach 1993&quot;/&gt;

==Evolution==

It is generally accepted that the halteres evolved from the non-flight wings of insects &amp;mdash; the hind-wings of Diptera and the fore wings of Strepsiptera respectively. Their movement, structure, function and development all support this hypothesis. Characterizations of the arrangement of sensory organs known as [[campaniform sensilla]], found at the base of the haltere, show many similarities to those found at the base of the hindwings in other insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt; The sensilla are arranged in a way so similar to that of hindwings, that were the halteres to be replaced with wings, the forces produced would still be sufficient to activate the same sensory organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot;/&gt; Genetic studies have also brought to light many similarities between halteres and hindwings. In fact, haltere development has been traced back to a single gene (Ubx), which when deactivated results in the formation of a hindwing instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh 2007&quot; /&gt; Because just a single gene is responsible for this change, it is easy to imagine a small mutation here leading to the formation of the first halteres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh 2007&quot; /&gt;

===Convergent evolution===

Though no other structure with entirely the same function and morphology as halteres has been observed in nature, they have evolved at least twice in the class [[Insecta]], once in the order [[fly|Diptera]] and again in [[Strepsiptera]]. Another structure in the class insecta also exists whose primary function is not the same as halteres, but that additionally serves a similar balancing function. This occurs in the order [[Lepidoptera]] and refers to the antennae of moths and butterflies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2007&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Strepsiptera.png|300px|thumb|right|Strepsipteran halteres: teardrop-shaped structures located between the fore and mid legs (indicated by red arrows) [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011887]]]

====Strepsipteran haltere====

[[Strepsiptera]]ns are a unique group of insects with major sexual dimorphism. The females spend their entire lives in a grub-like state, [[parasitism|parasitizing]] larger insects. The only time they ever come out of their host insect is to extend their fused heads and [[thorax|thoraces]] for males to notice. The males are also parasites, but they eventually will leave their [[host (biology)|host]] to seek their female counterparts. Because of this, they still retain the ability to fly. Male strepsipterans uniquely possess two hindwings, while their forewings have taken on the club-like form of halteres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Proffitt|first1=F.|title=PARASITOLOGY: Twisted Parasites From|journal=Science|date=21 January 2005|volume=307|issue=5708|pages=343|doi=10.1126/science.307.5708.343|pmid=15661988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though strepsipterans are very difficult to locate and are additionally rather short-lived, Pix ''et al.'' (1993) confirmed that the specialized forewings that male Strepsiptera possess perform the same function as dipteran halteres. Rotational movements of the body combined with the oscillating halteres produce Coriolis forces that can be detected by fields of mechanosensors (campaniform sensilla) located at the base of the halteres. Using functional morphology and behavior studies, Pix ''et al.'' showed that these sensors then transmit body position information to the head and abdomen to produce compensatory movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pix 1993&quot; /&gt; For simplicity, the remainder of this article will refer only to dipteran halteres.

====Lepidopteran antennae====

Certain [[lepidoptera]]ns (moths and butterflies) exhibit small amplitude oscillation of their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] at constant angles during flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sane|first1=SP|last2=Dieudonné|first2=A|last3=Willis|first3=MA|last4=Daniel|first4=TL|title=Antennal mechanosensors mediate flight control in moths.|journal=Science|date=9 February 2007|volume=315|issue=5813|pages=863–6|pmid=17290001|doi=10.1126/science.1133598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antennal movements in lepidopterans were originally hypothesized to aid in wind or gravity perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niehaus|first1=Monika|title=Flight and flight control by the antennae in the Small Tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae L., Lepidoptera)|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1981|volume=145|issue=2|pages=257–264|doi=10.1007/BF00605038}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed using the hawk moth, ''Manduca sexta'', confirmed that these tiny, antennal oscillations were actually contributing to body rotation sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2007&quot; /&gt;

Sane ''et al.'' (2007) determined that antennae were responsible for flight stabilization in hawk moths by removing the long part of the antenna (the flagellum), then reattaching it to determine its influence on flight performance. When the flagella were removed, the moths were no longer able to maintain stable flight. After reattachment of the flagella, flight performance was restored. The source of this difference was determined to be mechanosensory. There are two sets of mechanosensory organs located at the base of the lepidopteran antenna, Böhm's bristles and the Johnston organ. These fields of receptors respond to different directions of antennal movements. Antennae are also capable of sensing odor, humidity, and temperature. Sane ''et al.'' (2007) was able to demonstrate that it was the mechanosensors that were responsible for flight stability as opposed to the other sensory organs, because when the flagella were removed and then reattached, all antennal nerves were severed excluding those at the base (Böhm's bristles and the Johnston organ).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2007&quot; /&gt;

==Genetics==

In segmented organisms there are genes called [[Hox gene]]s, which determines the development of [[serial homology|serial homologs]], or repeating structures within an organism (e.g. jointed appendages of [[arthropod]]s or [[vertebra]]e in mammals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serial homology|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/serial-homology|website=britannica.com/|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In insects, the [[thorax]] is separated into different segments. One of the things that the Hox gene [[ultrabithorax|''Ultrabithorax (Ubx)'']] is responsible for, is specifying the identity of the third [[thorax|thoracic]] segment of their body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hersh|first1=Bradley M.|last2=Nelson|first2=Craig E.|last3=Stoll|first3=Samantha J.|last4=Norton|first4=Jason E.|last5=Albert|first5=Thomas J.|last6=Carroll|first6=Sean B.|title=The UBX-regulated network in the haltere imaginal disc of D. melanogaster|journal=Developmental Biology|date=February 2007|volume=302|issue=2|pages=717–727|doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.11.011|pmid=17174297|pmc=1892158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper hindwing development in a number of insect species is dependent on ''Ubx'', including butterflies, beetles, and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weatherbee 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weatherbee|first1=SD|last2=Halder|first2=G|last3=Kim|first3=J|last4=Hudson|first4=A|last5=Carroll|first5=S|title=Ultrabithorax regulates genes at several levels of the wing-patterning hierarchy to shape the development of the Drosophila haltere.|journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=15 May 1998|volume=12|issue=10|pages=1474–82|pmid=9585507|doi=10.1101/gad.12.10.1474|pmc=316835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weatherbee|first1=SD|last2=Nijhout|first2=HF|last3=Grunert|first3=LW|last4=Halder|first4=G|last5=Galant|first5=R|last6=Selegue|first6=J|last7=Carroll|first7=S|title=Ultrabithorax function in butterfly wings and the evolution of insect wing patterns.|journal=Current Biology|date=11 February 1999|volume=9|issue=3|pages=109–15|pmid=10021383|doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80064-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomoyasu|first1=Y|last2=Wheeler|first2=SR|last3=Denell|first3=RE|title=Ultrabithorax is required for membranous wing identity in the beetle Tribolium castaneum.|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2005|volume=433|issue=7026|pages=643–7|pmid=15703749|doi=10.1038/nature03272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fruit flies, (''Ubx'') is responsible for the formation of the halteres during [[metamorphosis]]. If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully formed wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh 2007&quot; /&gt; This single [[homeotic gene]] change results in a radically different [[phenotype]], but also begins to give us some insight into how the ancestors of flies' hindwings may have originally evolved into halteres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hersh 2007&quot; /&gt;

Though it is clear that ''Ubx'' is the primary gene responsible for hindwing formation, Ubx also regulates other genes once expressed. Weatherbee (1998) postulated that differences in ''Ubx'' expression patterns or levels may not be responsible for the observed physiological changes. Instead, he suggested that ''Ubx''-regulated target gene sets were the direct source of the observed changes. Several ''Ubx''-regulated target genes have been identified, including two direct targets, ''spalt'' and ''knot'', which are expressed in the wing and repressed in halteres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hersh|first1=BM|last2=Carroll|first2=SB|title=Direct regulation of knot gene expression by Ultrabithorax and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila.|journal=Development |date=April 2005|volume=132|issue=7|pages=1567–77|pmid=15753212|doi=10.1242/dev.01737|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galant|first1=R|last2=Walsh|first2=CM|last3=Carroll|first3=SB|title=Hox repression of a target gene: extradenticle-independent, additive action through multiple monomer binding sites.|journal=Development |date=July 2002|volume=129|issue=13|pages=3115–26|pmid=12070087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other genes which are expressed in wings and repressed in halteres have also been identified, but whether or not they act as direct targets of ''Ubx'' regulation are still unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weatherbee 1998&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crickmore|first1=MA|last2=Mann|first2=RS|title=Hox control of organ size by regulation of morphogen production and mobility.|journal=Science|date=7 July 2006|volume=313|issue=5783|pages=63–8|pmid=16741075|doi=10.1126/science.1128650|pmc=2628481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohit|first1=P|last2=Makhijani|first2=K|last3=Madhavi|first3=MB|last4=Bharathi|first4=V|last5=Lal|first5=A|last6=Sirdesai|first6=G|last7=Reddy|first7=VR|last8=Ramesh|first8=P|last9=Kannan|first9=R|last10=Dhawan|first10=J|last11=Shashidhara|first11=LS|title=Modulation of AP and DV signaling pathways by the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax during haltere development in Drosophila.|journal=Developmental Biology|date=15 March 2006|volume=291|issue=2|pages=356–67|pmid=16414040|doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.12.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics==

Bottom image shows transverse cross section of fly [http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001822].]]

Dipteran insects along with the majority of other insect orders use what are known as [[insect flight|indirect flight]] muscles to accomplish flight. Indirect [[insect flight]] muscles are composed of two sets of perpendicular muscles (see left figure) that are attached to the thorax (instead of directly to the wing base as is the case for direct flight muscles). When the first set of muscles contracts, they deform the body of the insect and compress its thorax vertically, which lifts the wings. When the first set of muscles relaxes and the second set contracts, the thorax is squeezed in the opposite direction, which extends the body vertically and moves the wings downward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Insect Flight Steering Muscles Work|journal = PLoS Biol|date = 2014-03-25|pmc = 3965378|pmid = 24667632|pages = e1001822|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001822|first = Anders|last = Hedenström}}&lt;/ref&gt; The below figure demonstrates this movement with only the first set of muscles.

[[File:Motion of Insectwing.gif|thumb|200px|right|Motion of an insect wing: &lt;br&gt;'''a''' wings &lt;br&gt;'''b''' primary and secondary flight joints &lt;br&gt;'''c''' dorsoventral flight muscles &lt;br&gt;'''d''' longitudinal muscles]]

The movement of the wings and the halteres are mechanically coupled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deora|first1=Tanvi|last2=Singh|first2=Amit Kumar|last3=Sane|first3=Sanjay P.|title=Biomechanical basis of wing and haltere coordination in flies|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=3 February 2015|volume=112|issue=5|pages=1481–1486|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412279112|pmid=25605915|pmc=4321282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sane ''et al.'' (2015) demonstrated that in freshly killed flies, without any neural input, the movement of wings was still coupled with the movement of halteres. When a [[forceps|forcep]] was used to manually move a wing up and down, not only did the opposite wing move in synchrony, the halteres also beat in [[Phase (waves)#Phase difference|antiphase]] with both wings. The source of this coupling however, was not between the muscles which control the halteres and those that control the wings. Instead, two small ridges of [[cuticle]] known as the subepimeral ridges were found to be responsible. These ridges connect the right wing to the right haltere and the left wing to the left haltere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2015&quot;/&gt;

Each side of the body must be synchronized and the two sides are also coupled. That is, the left and right wings and thus the left and right halteres always beat at the same frequency. However, the amplitude of the wingbeat does not always have to be the same on the left and right side. This is what allows the flies to turn and is accomplished using a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]], much like what you would find in an automobile. This gearbox can change the maximum amplitude of the wing movement and determine its speed of motion. The wings of flies even have a [[clutch]] structure at their base. The clutch moves between grooves in the gearbox, to engage and disengage the wing muscles and also modulate the wingbeat amplitude. When the amplitude of the left wing is less than the right, the fly will make a left turn. Even though haltere movement is controlled by separate muscles than the wings, because the wings are mechanically coupled with the halteres, changes in wingbeat frequency extend to the haltere-beat frequency as well, but haltere beat amplitude does not change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sane 2015&quot;/&gt;

Although halteres are coupled with the wings and with each other during flight, some flies oscillate their halteres while walking (without oscillating their wings). Because the haltere muscles are tiny in comparison to the flight muscles, flight muscle activity completely overshadows that of the haltere muscles during flight. It is unknown how haltere muscle activity during flight differs from walking. The left and right halteres show much more variable phase relationships while walking compared with flying, which may indicate decoupling of the left and right haltere muscles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2015&quot; /&gt;

===Differences between species===

Although halteres are always synchronized with the movements of the wings, the phase at which they oscillate differs between species. [[Brachycera]]n flies (short-antennaed) oscillate their halteres almost exactly opposite their wings (180 degrees). More ancient suborders such as the [[nematocera|Nematecerans]] (long-antennaed flies), which for example include crane flies and mosquitoes, exhibit a variety of wing-haltere phasing. These observed differences in wing-haltere coordination suggest that differences in sensory neuron output also exist between species. This means that the decoding mechanisms used by the [[central nervous system]] to interpret such movements and produce adequate motor output probably also vary depending on [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 2015&quot; /&gt;

The general structure of halteres are well recognized, but much variability exists between species. The more ancient families, such as [[crane fly|tipulidae]] (crane flies), possess halteres with rather long stalks. This causes the haltere bulbs to be much further from the body and easily visible to the naked eye. More derived families, such as [[Calliphoridae]] (blow flies), have developed specialized structures called &quot;calyptrae&quot; or &quot;squama&quot;, which are tiny flaps of wing, that cover the haltere. Pringle (1948) hypothesized that they prevented wind turbulence from affecting haltere movements, allowing more precise detection of body position, but this was never tested. The stalk of the haltere is also not always straight. Instead, the stalk's shape in more derived families tends to be reflective of the body shape of the individual. This minimizes the amount of air space between end-knobs and the sides of the abdomen and thorax. In these families, the halteres beat so close to the body that the distance between haltere and thorax is a fraction of the diameter of the haltere bulb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt; An extreme example of this trait is in the family [[hoverfly|Syrphidae]] (hoverflies), where the bulb of the haltere is positioned nearly perpendicular to the stalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognising hoverflies|url=http://www.biodiversityireland.ie/projects/irish-pollinator-initiative/hoverflies/recognising-hoverflies/|website=National Biodiversity Data Centre|publisher=Biodiversity Ireland|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flies typically hold their halteres at a 90 degree offset. To visualize this, if you were to imagine a person holding their arms out sideways, this would be a 180 degree offset. If that person then moved their arms backward so that the angle created between their fingertips and spine was 90 degrees, this would be a 90 degree offset. The halteres of flies work the same way. They are positioned behind their bodies, forming a 90 degree angle between the haltere bulbs and the center of their thorax. It is necessary for the halteres to be positioned like this in order to detect the three axes of motion. Those axes are yaw pitch and roll, as illustrated in the above figure (Directions of rotation). The [[mechanoreceptor]]s at the base of the halteres are only able to measure force in two directions (horizontal and vertical), so a single haltere is only able to measure rotations along two of the three axes. Because the halteres are set at different angles (90 degree offset), they also beat along two separate horizontal and vertical axes. This gives them the ability to acquire information from two non-parallel planes and allows sensation of rotation in all three directions. However, flies are most sensitive to pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jonathan|title=Living With Halteres III|url=https://livingwithinsects.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/living-with-halteres-iii/|website=Living with insects blog|publisher=The Twenty Ten Theme.

===Neurophysiology===

When halteres are experimentally induced to flap, volleys of [[action potential]]s within the [[haltere#haltere nerve|haltere nerve]] occur in synchrony with the haltere-beat frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt; When flies are then rotated, these volleys break down, likely in response to different groups of [[sensillum|sensilla]] being activated to inform the fly of its recently changed body position. Haltere [[afferent nerve fiber|afferents]] have also been shown to terminate in the [[mesothorax|mesothoracic]] [[neuropil]] where flight muscle neurons are located.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan 1998&quot; /&gt; Haltere afferent activity responding to rotations and wing steering behavior converge in this processing region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan 1998&quot; /&gt;

====The haltere nerve====

[[sensory neuron|Sensory inputs]] from five sensory fields located at the base of the haltere all converge onto one nerve, the haltere nerve. How these sensory fields are organized at the level of the central nervous system is currently unknown. It has been determined that those five sensory fields all project to the thorax in a &quot;region-specific&quot; way and afferents originating from the forewing were also shown to converge in the same regions. Not every specific target for the haltere afferents have been determined, but a few connections between [[motor neuron]]s known to be involved in wing steering control and particular haltere sensory fields have been identified, particularly one synapse between the haltere nerve and a wing steering motor neuron known as mnb1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan 1998&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fayyazuddin|first1=A|last2=Dickinson|first2=MH|title=Haltere afferents provide direct, electrotonic input to a steering motor neuron in the blowfly, Calliphora.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 August 1996|volume=16|issue=16|pages=5225–32|pmid=8756451|pmc=6579303|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-16-05225.1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscles===

Flies use indirect flight muscles to accomplish wing movement, and the beating haltere movements are driven by the same group of muscles (see dynamics section). In addition to the indirect flight muscles which are responsible for the flapping motion, there are also steering muscle which control the rotation/angle of the wings. Because halteres evolved from hindwings, the same complement of steering muscles exists for the other directions of movement as well. Chan ''et al.'' (1998) identified 10 direct control muscles in the haltere similar to those found in the forewing. In 1998, Chan and Dickinson proposed that the planned haltere movements (without external forces acting on them) were what initiated planned turns. To explain this, imagine a fly that wishes to turn to the right. Unfortunately, as soon as it does, the halteres sense a body rotation and [[reflex]]ively correct the turn, preventing the fly from changing direction. Chan and Dickinson (1998) suggested that what the fly does to prevent this from occurring is to first move its halteres as if it were being pushed in the opposite direction that it wants to go. The fly has not moved, but the halteres have sensed a perturbation. This would allow the haltere-initiated reflex to occur, correcting the imagined perturbation. The fly would then be able to execute its turn in the desired direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=WP|last2=Prete|first2=F|last3=Dickinson|first3=MH|title=Visual input to the efferent control system of a fly's &quot;gyroscope&quot;.|journal=Science|date=10 April 1998|volume=280|issue=5361|pages=289–92|pmid=9535659|doi=10.1126/science.280.5361.289|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/085d7b04bad81cc3651f9814f3bdf530d28f09b7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not how flies actually turn. Mureli and Fox (2015) showed that flies are still capable of performing planned turns even when their halteres have been removed entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mureli 2015&quot;/&gt;

Four fields are located dorsally -- the dorsal Hick's papillae (dHP), dorsal basal plate (dBP), dorsal scapal plate (dSP), and the dorsal flanking sensilla (FS).

===Campaniform sensilla===

The way in which rotation sensation is accomplished is that there are five distinct sensory fields located at the base of the haltere. These fields, which actually contain the majority of [[campaniform sensilla]] found on the [[exoskeleton]] of blowflies (more than 400 campaniform sensilla per haltere),&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan 1998&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnatzy 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gnatzy|first1=Werner|last2=Grunert|first2=Ulrike|last3=Bender|first3=Manfred|title=Campaniform sensilla of Calliphora vicina (Insecta, Diptera)|journal=Zoomorphology|date=March 1987|volume=106|issue=5|pages=312–319|doi=10.1007/BF00312005}}&lt;/ref&gt; are activated in response to strain created by movements at the haltere base in different directions (due to Coriolis forces acting on the end knobs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraenkel 1938&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nalbach 1993&quot;/&gt; Campaniform sensilla are cap-shaped protrusions located on the surface of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of insects. Attached inside the cap is the tip of a [[dendrite|dendritic]] projection (or [[sensory nerve]] fiber). The outer segment of the dendritic projection is attached to the inside surface of the cap. When the haltere is pushed to one side, the cuticle of the insect bends and the surface of the cap is distorted. The inner dendrite is able to detect this distortion and convert it to an electrical signal which is sent to the central nervous system to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keil|first1=TA|title=Functional morphology of insect mechanoreceptors.|journal=Microscopy Research and Technique|date=15 December 1997|volume=39|issue=6|pages=506–31|pmid=9438251|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0029(19971215)39:6&lt;506::aid-jemt5&gt;3.0.co;2-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chordotonal organs===

[[Chordotonal organs]] detect and transmit distortions in their position/shape in the same way that campaniform sensilla do. They differ slightly at their site of detection. Chordotonal organs, unlike campaniform sensilla, exist beneath the cuticle and typically respond to stretch as opposed to distortion or bending. Their sensory nerve endings attach between two internal points and when those points are stretched, the difference in length is what is detected and transformed into electrical signaling. There are far fewer chordotonal organs at the base of the haltere than campaniform sensilla (on the order of hundreds), so it is assumed that they are far less important for detecting and transmitting rotational information from haltere movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pringle 1948&quot; /&gt;

==Role in visual processing==

===Head stabilization===
[[arthropod eye|Insect eyes]] are unable to move independently of the head. In order for flies to stabilize their [[visual field]]s, they must adjust the position of their entire head. Sensory inputs detected by halteres not only determine the position of the body, but also, the position of the head, which can move independently from the body. Halteres are particularly useful for detecting fast perturbations during flight and only respond to angular velocities (speeds of rotation) above a certain threshold. When flies are focused on an object in front of them and their body is rotated, they are able to maintain their head position so that the object remains focused and upright. Hengstenberg (1988) found that in the roll direction of rotation, the flies' ability to maintain their head position in response to body motion was only observed at speeds above 50 degrees per second and their ability peaked at 1500 degrees per second. When halteres were removed at the bulb (to retain intact sensory organs at the base) the fly's ability to perceive roll movements at high angular velocities disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hengstenberg 1988&quot; /&gt;

Halteres and vision both play a role in stabilizing the head. Flies are also able to perform compensatory head movements to stabilize their vision without the use of their halteres. When the visual field is artificially rotated around a fly at slower angular velocities, head stabilization still occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hengstenberg 1988&quot; /&gt; Head stabilization outputs due to optical inputs alone are slower to respond, but also last longer than those due to haltere inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hengstenberg|first1=Roland|title=Gaze control in the blowfly Calliphora: a multisensory, two-stage integration process|journal=Seminars in Neuroscience|date=February 1991|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19–29|doi=10.1016/1044-5765(91)90063-T|url=http://www.kyb.mpg.de/publications/pdfs/pdf1287.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.117.2646}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this result it can be concluded that although halteres are required for detecting fast rotations, the visual system is adept by itself at sensing and correcting for slower body movements. Thus, the visual and mechanosensory (halteres) systems work together to stabilize the visual field of the animal: first, by quickly responding to fast changes (halteres), and second, by maintaining that response until it is corrected (vision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=Sawyer Buckminster|last2=Straw|first2=Andrew D.|last3=Peek|first3=Martin Y.|last4=Murray|first4=Richard M.|last5=Dickinson|first5=Michael H.|title=Flying stabilize their vision-based velocity controller by sensing wind with their antennae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1 April 2014|volume=111|issue=13|pages=E1182–E1191|doi=10.1073/pnas.1323529111|pmid=24639532|pmc=3977237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual-motor integration===

Flies rely on both visual information from their compound eyes and mechanical input from their halteres. Sherman and Dickinson (2002) discovered that the responsiveness of the halteres and eyes are tuned to complementary speeds of rotation. Responses to body rotations detected via the visual system are greatest at slow speeds and decrease with increased angular velocity. In contrast, body rotations detected by the halteres elicit the greatest responses at higher angular velocities and degrade as the speed of rotation decreases. The integration of these two separately tuned sensors allows the flies to detect a wide range of angular velocities in all three directions of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=A|last2=Dickinson|first2=MH|title=A comparison of visual and haltere-mediated equilibrium reflexes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=January 2003|volume=206|issue=Pt 2|pages=295–302|pmid=12477899|doi=10.1242/jeb.00075|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

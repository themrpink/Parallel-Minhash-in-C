[[Allergic rhinitis|Nasal allergy]] to pollen is called [[pollinosis]], and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called [[hay fever]]. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of [[birch]] and [[alder]], and in late summer [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]] and different forms of [[hay]]. Grass pollen is also associated with [[Asthma|asthma exacerbations]] in some people, a phenomenon termed [[thunderstorm asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Erbas|first1=B.|last2=Jazayeri|first2=M.|last3=Lambert|first3=K.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous [[goldenrod]] flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by [[ragweed]], a widespread anemophilous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Tom|title=Dear allergy sufferers: Don't blame goldenrod|url=http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/stories/dear-allergy-sufferers-dont-blame-goldenrod|website=mnn.com|publisher=Mother Nature Network|access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing [[irrigation|irrigated lawns and gardens]], more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[pecan]], and early summer [[grass]]es may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;40&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skoner|first1=DP|title=Allergic rhinitis: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detection, and diagnosis.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2001|volume=108|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–8|pmid=11449200|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.115569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent [[allergic response]] in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of [[Hereditary disease|hereditary origin]]. Individuals who suffer from [[eczema]] or are [[asthma]]tic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/allergies/living-with-allergies-10/rhinitis Allergies and Hay Fever] WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed.&lt;ref&gt;Siewertsen, Bjarne. &quot;[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ Hård nyser for allergikere i varm fremtid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165510/http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ |date=2015-04-19 }}&quot;  (English: Hard sneeze for allergic people in warm future) ''[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]'', 18 April 2015. Retrieved: 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a [[General practitioner|general physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ Bee, grass pollen allergy symptoms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010200012/http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ |date=2009-10-10 }}. allergiesandtreatments.com.

===Treatment===
{{main article|Allergic rhinitis#treatment}}
[[Antihistamines]] are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis; this type of non-prescribed drugs includes [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]]. They do not prevent the discharge of [[histamine]], but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this [[biogenic amine]], which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

[[Decongestants]] can be administered in different ways such as tablets and [[nasal spray]]s.

[[Allergen immunotherapy|Allergy immunotherapy]] (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue française d'allergologie et d'immunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of [[predatory]] and [[parasitic]] [[arthropod]]s contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that [[bee]]s are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many [[Hymenoptera]] other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as [[larva]]e (including some [[ant]] larvae). [[Spider]]s are normally considered [[carnivore]]s but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for [[spider]]lings, which catch pollen on their [[spider web|webs]]. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some [[Acari|predatory mites]] also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as ''[[Euseius tularensis]]'', which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as [[Mordellidae]] and [[Melyridae]] feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as [[Curculionidae]], [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], and [[Scarabaeidae]] are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40,000 species of [[Carabidae|ground beetle]]s, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1,000 species). Similarly, [[Ladybird]] beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. [[Hemiptera]] are mostly [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the [[Anthocoridae]]). Many adult flies, especially [[Syrphidae]], feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all [[Fly|flies]], cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = The Pollen Feeders| title = Relationships of Natural Enemies and Non-Prey Foods| volume = 7| pages = 87–11| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-4020-9234-3| doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-9235-0_6| last1 = Lundgren| first1 = Jonathan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of fungus, including ''[[Fomes fomentarius]]'', are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees|author1=Schwarze, Francis W.

Some species of ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies consume pollen as adults, which appears to be a valuable nutrient source, and these species are more distasteful to predators than the non-pollen consuming species.&lt;ref&gt;Salcledo, Christian.

Although [[bat]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[hummingbird]]s are not pollen eaters ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]'', their consumption of [[nectar]] in flowers is an important aspect of the [[pollination]] process.

===In humans===
[[Bee pollen]] for human consumption is marketed as a [[food]] ingredient and as a [[dietary supplement]]. The largest constituent is [[carbohydrate]]s, with protein content ranging from 7 to 35 percent depending on the plant species collected by bees.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Malcolm T. {{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158 |title=Producing Pollen |access-date=2015-07-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113100544/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158 |archive-date=January 13, 2007 }}, University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences; citing P.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except from the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archive-url = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00004421/00001| title = Producing Pollen | author = Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher = University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | access-date=2007-08-30}}.

===Parasites===
The growing industries in pollen harvesting for human and bee consumption rely on harvesting pollen baskets from honey bees as they return to their hives using a ''pollen trap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBP9pw2rNk4 | title=How a Pollen Trap Works (Bee Pollen)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this pollen has been tested for parasites, it has been found that a multitude of pollinator viruses and eukaryotic parasites are present in the pollen.&lt;ref name=Graystock2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graystock|first1=Peter|last2=Yates|first2=Kathryn|last3=Evison|first3=Sophie E.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some [[Native American religions]], pollen was used in [[prayer]]s and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by [[sanctifying]] objects, dancing grounds, trails, and [[sandpainting]]s. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths. Many [[Navajo]] people believed the body became [[holy]] when it traveled over a trail sprinkled with pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Native American Religions|last=Hirshfelder|first=Arlene|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=978-0816039494|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scutum''' is a small [[constellation]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[shield]], and it was originally named '''Scutum Sobiescianum''' by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1684.  It lies entirely in the [[southern celestial hemisphere]] and its four brightest stars form a narrow diamond shape.  It is one of the 88 [[IAU designated constellations]] defined in 1922.

==History==
[[Image:Scutum Sobiescianum.PNG|thumb|left|''Scutum Sobiescianum'' in ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' 1690]]

Scutum was named in 1684 by Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/scutum.htm Star Tales ― Scutum] by [[Ian Ridpath]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Jan Heweliusz), who originally named it ''Scutum Sobiescianum'' (Shield of Sobieski) to commemorate the victory of the Christian forces led by Polish King [[John III Sobieski]] (Jan III Sobieski) in the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683. Later, the name was shortened to Scutum.

Five bright stars of Scutum ([[Alpha Scuti|α Sct]], [[Beta Scuti|β Sct]], [[Delta Scuti|δ Sct]], [[Epsilon Scuti|ε Sct]] and [[Eta Scuti|η Sct]]) were previously known as 1, 6, 2, 3, and 9 Aquilae respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The constellation of Scutum was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922 as one of the 88 constellations covering the entire sky, with the official abbreviation of &quot;Sct&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | date=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constellation boundaries are defined by a quadrilateral. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|18|21.6}} and {{RA|18|59.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −3.83° and −15.94°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Scutum, Constellation Boundary | journal=The Constellations | publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#sct | accessdate=3 September 2020 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, the Chinese also associated these stars with battle armor, incorporating them into the larger [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] known as ''Tien Pien'', i.e., the Heavenly Casque (or Helmet).&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names and Their Meanings, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

Scutum is not a bright constellation, with the brightest star, [[Alpha Scuti]], at magnitude 3.85. But some stars are notable in the constellation. [[Beta Scuti]] is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by [[Delta Scuti]] at magnitude 4.72. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type similar to the Sun, although it is 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is now coming at the direction of the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it will come as close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than [[Sirius]] by that time.

[[UY Scuti]] is a red supergiant pulsating variable star and is also one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars currently known]] with a radius of 1,708 times that of the Sun. [[Stephenson 2-18]] is another red supergiant star and is frequently described as the largest star currently known, with a radius of 2,150 times that of the Sun.

===Deep sky objects===

Although not a large constellation, Scutum contains several [[open cluster]]s, as well as a [[globular cluster]] and a [[planetary nebula]]. The two best known [[deep sky object]]s in Scutum are [[Wild Duck Cluster|M11]] (the Wild Duck Cluster) and the [[Open Cluster M26|open cluster M26]] (NGC 6694). The globular cluster [[NGC 6712]] and the planetary nebula [[IC 1295]] can be found in the eastern part of the constellation, only 24 arcminutes apart.

The most prominent open cluster in Scutum is the [[Wild Duck Cluster]], M11. It was named by [[William Henry Smyth]] in 1844 for its resemblance in the eyepiece to a flock of ducks in flight. The cluster, 6200 light-years from Earth and 20 light-years in diameter, contains approximately 3000 stars, making it a particularly rich cluster. It is 220 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = So, Where Are the Wild Ducks?! |last = MacRobert |first = Alan |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space exploration ==
The [[space probe]] [[Pioneer 11]] is moving in the direction of this constellation. It will not be nearing the closest star in this constellation for over a million years&lt;ref&gt;Pioneer 11 is travelling at ~2.4 au/yr, 41.54 ly ≈ 2.627x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;au.&lt;/ref&gt; at present speed, by which time its batteries will be long dead.

:''See [[Transmission (mechanics)]] for a car's transmission system''
In [[telecommunications]], a '''transmission system''' is a system that transmits a signal from one place to another. The signal can be an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical]], optical or [[Radio wave|radio signal]].

Some transmission systems contain multipliers, which amplify a signal prior to re-transmission, or [[Regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerators]], which attempt to reconstruct and re-shape the coded message before re-transmission.

One of the most widely used transmission system technologies in the [[Internet]] and the [[PSTN]] is [[SONET]].

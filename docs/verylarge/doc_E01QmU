The '''Indus Valley Civilisation'''&lt;!--NOT A TYPO. DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO Civilization.--&gt; ('''IVC''') was a [[Bronze Age]] [[civilisation]] in the northwestern regions of [[South Asia]], lasting from 3300&amp;nbsp;BCE to 1300&amp;nbsp;BCE, and in its mature form from 2600&amp;nbsp;BCE to 1900&amp;nbsp;BCE.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=1}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wright: &quot;Mesopotamia and Egypt ... co-existed with the Indus civilization during its florescence between 2600 and 1900&amp;nbsp;BC.&quot;{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=1}}}} Together with [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], it was one of three early civilisations of the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]], and of the three, the most widespread, its sites spanning an area stretching from northeast [[Afghanistan]], through much of [[Pakistan]], and into western and northwestern [[India]].{{sfn|Wright|2009}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wright: &quot;The Indus civilisation is one of three in the 'Ancient East' that, along with Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, was a cradle of early civilisation in the Old World (Childe, 1950). Mesopotamia and Egypt were longer lived, but coexisted with Indus civilisation during its florescence between 2600 and 1900&amp;nbsp;B.C. Of the three, the Indus was the most expansive, extending from today's northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and India.&quot;{{sfn|Wright|2009}}}} It flourished in the basins of the [[Indus River]], which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the seasonal [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar-Hakra river]] in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=1}}{{Sfn|Giosan|Clift|Macklin|Fuller|2012}}

The civilisation's cities were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and new techniques in handicraft ([[carnelian]] products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin).{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=115–125}} The large cities of [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] very likely grew to containing between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals,{{Sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Dyson: &quot;Mohenjo-daro and Harappa may each have contained between 30,000 and 60,000&amp;nbsp;people (perhaps more in the former case). Water transport was crucial for the provisioning of these and other cities. That said, the vast majority of people lived in rural areas. At the height of the Indus valley civilization the subcontinent may have contained 4-6&amp;nbsp;million people.&quot;{{Sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}}} and the civilisation itself during its florescence may have contained between one and five million individuals.{{Sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=187}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|McIntosh: &quot;The enormous potential of the greater Indus region offered scope for huge population increase; by the end of the Mature Harappan period, the Harappans are estimated to have numbered somewhere between 1 and 5&amp;nbsp;million, probably well below the region's carrying capacity.&quot;{{Sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=187}}}}

Gradual [[Aridification|drying]] of the region's soil during the 3rd&amp;nbsp;millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually weaker monsoons and reduced water supply caused the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward and southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0012059 |title=Uncovering transitions in paleoclimate time series and the climate driven demise of an ancient civilization |series=Nishant Malik, Chaos (2020)|year=2020 |doi=10.1063/5.0012059 |last1=Malik |first1=Nishant |journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science |volume=30 |issue=8 |page=083108 |pmid=32872795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Brooke|first=John L.|title=Climate Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9TSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296|date= 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87164-8|page=296}} Quote: &quot;The story in Harappan India was somewhat different (see Figure 111.3). The Bronze Age village and urban societies of the Indus Valley are some-thing of an anomaly, in that archaeologists have found little indication of local defense and regional warfare. It would seem that the bountiful monsoon rainfall of the Early to Mid-Holocene had forged a condition of plenty for all, and that competitive energies were channeled into commerce rather than conflict. Scholars have long argued that these rains shaped the origins of the urban Harappan societies, which emerged from Neolithic villages around 2600 BC. It now appears that this rainfall began to slowly taper off in the third millennium, at just the point that the Harappan cities began to develop. Thus it seems that this &quot;first urbanisation&quot; in South Asia was the initial response of the Indus Valley peoples to the beginning of Late Holocene aridification. These cities were maintained for 300 to 400 years and then gradually abandoned as the Harappan peoples resettled in scattered villages in the eastern range of their territories, into the Punjab and the Ganges Valley....' 17 (footnote) a)Liviu Giosan et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/109/26/E1688.full &quot;Fluvial Landscapes of the Harappan Civilization,&quot;] PNAS, 102 (2012), E1688—E1694; (b) Camilo Ponton, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL050722/full &quot;Holocene Aridification of India,&quot;] GRL 39 (2012), L03704;  (c) Harunur Rashid et al., [http://research.bpcrc.osu.edu/Icecore/publications/Rashid%20et%20al%20Terr%20Atmos%20Ocean%20Sci%202011v222p215.pdf &quot;Late Glacial to Holocene Indian Summer Monsoon Variability Based upon Sediment Records Taken from the Bay of Bengal,&quot;] Terrestrial, Atmospheric, and Oceanic Sciences 22 (2011), 215-28; (d) Marco Madella and Dorian Q.

The Indus civilisation is also known as the '''Harappan Civilisation''', after its [[type site]], Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated early in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century in what was then the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]] of [[British Raj|British India]] and now is Pakistan.{{Sfn|Habib|2015|p=13}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Habib: &quot;Harappa, in Sahiwal district of west Punjab, Pakistan, had long been known to archaeologists as an extensive site on the Ravi river, but its true significance as a major city of an early great civilization remained unrecognized until the discovery of Mohenjo-daro near the banks of the Indus, in the Larkana district of Sindh, by Rakhaldas Banerji in 1922. Sir John Marshall, then Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, used the term 'Indus civilization' for the culture discovered at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, a term doubly apt because of the geographical context implied in the name 'Indus' and the presence of cities implied in the word 'civilization'. Others, notably the Archaeological Survey of India after Independence, have preferred to call it `Harappan', or 'Mature Harappan', taking Harappa to be its type-site.&quot;{{Sfn|Habib|2015|p=13}}}} The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the culmination of work beginning in 1861 with the founding of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] during the [[British Raj]].{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=2}} There were however earlier and later cultures often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan in the same area; for this reason, the Harappan civilisation is sometimes called the '''Mature Harappan''' to distinguish it from these other cultures.

By 2002, over 1,000 Mature Harappan cities and settlements had been reported, of which just under a hundred had been excavated,{{Sfn|Possehl|2002a|pp=62–76}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Possehl: &quot;There are 1,056&amp;nbsp;Mature Harappan sites that have been reported of which 96 have been excavated.&quot;{{Sfn|Possehl|2002a|pp=62–76}}}}{{Sfn|Possehl|2002|p=20}}{{Sfn|Singh|2008|p=137}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Singh: &quot;Today, the count of Harappan sites has risen to about 1,022, of which 406 are in Pakistan and 616 in India.

She notes that the essential characteristics of Indus valley urbanism, such as planned cities, complex fortifications, elaborate drainage systems, the use of mud and fire bricks, monumental buildings, extensive craft activity, are completely absent in the Rigveda. Similarly the Rigveda lacks a conceptual familiarity with key aspects of organised urban life (e.g. non-kin labour, facets or items of an exchange system or complex weights and measures) and doesn't mention objects found in great numbers at Indus Valley civilisation sites like terracotta figurines, sculptural representation of human bodies or seals.}} Recent geophysical research suggests that unlike the Sarasvati, whose descriptions in the Rig Veda are those of a snow-fed river, the Ghaggar-Hakra was a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers, which became seasonal around the time that the civilisation diminished, approximately 4,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.{{Sfn|Giosan|Clift|Macklin|Fuller|2012}} {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Giosan (2012): &quot;Numerous speculations have advanced the idea that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system, at times identified with the lost mythical river of Sarasvati (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 19), was a large glacier fed Himalayan river. Potential sources for this river include the Yamuna River, the Sutlej River, or both rivers. However, the lack of large-scale incision on the interfluve demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene. ... The present Ghaggar-Hakra valley and its tributary rivers are currently dry or have seasonal flows. Yet rivers were undoubtedly active in this region during the Urban Harappan Phase. We recovered sandy fluvial deposits approximately 5,400&amp;nbsp;y old at Fort Abbas in Pakistan (SI Text), and recent work (33) on the upper Ghaggar-Hakra interfluve in India also documented Holocene channel sands that are approximately 4,300&amp;nbsp;y old. On the upper interfluve, fine-grained floodplain deposition continued until the end of the Late Harappan Phase, as recent as 2,900&amp;nbsp;y ago (33) (Fig.&amp;nbsp;2B). This widespread fluvial redistribution of sediment suggests that reliable monsoon rains were able to sustain perennial rivers earlier during the Holocene and explains why Harappan settlements flourished along the entire Ghaggar-Hakra system without access to a glacier-fed river.&quot;{{Sfn|Giosan|Clift|Macklin|Fuller|2012}}}}  In addition, proponents of the Sarasvati nomenclature see a connection between the decline of the Indus civilisation and the rise of the [[Vedic civilisation]] on the Gangetic plain; however, historians of the decline of the mature Indus civilisation consider the two to be substantially disconnected.{{Sfn|Sen|2019|p=81}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Sen: &quot;The so-called lost-Saraswati controversy has reignited the debate about the end of the Harappan civilization and the beginning of the Vedic civilization of the Ganges. Were aspects of the mature Vedic cultures of the first millennium B.C.E. derived from a late version of the Indus Valley culture? Historians of the decline of the Harappan phase of the Indus Valley civilization such as Shereen Ratnagar have described the two as essentially disconnected, separated in both time and substance.&quot;{{Sfn|Sen|2019|p=81}}}}

== Extent ==
[[File:IVC-major-sites-2.jpg|right|thumb|Major sites and extent of the Indus Valley Civilization]]

The Indus civilization was roughly contemporary with the other riverine civilisations of the ancient world: [[Egypt]] along the [[Nile]], [[Mesopotamia]] in the lands watered by the [[Euphrates]] and the [[Tigris]], and [[China]] in the drainage basin of the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze]]. By the time of its mature phase, the civilisation had spread over an area larger than the others, which included a core of {{convert|1500|km|mi|sigfig=1}} up the alluvial plain of the Indus and its tributaries. In addition, there was a region with disparate flora, fauna, and habitats, up to ten times as large, which had been shaped culturally and economically by the Indus.{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=35}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Fisher: &quot;This was the same broad period that saw the rise of the civilizations of Mesopotamia (between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers), Egypt (along the Nile), and northeast China (in the Yellow River basin). At its peak, the Indus was the most extensive of these ancient civilizations, extending {{convert|1500|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} up the Indus plain, with a core area of {{convert|30000|to|100000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and with more ecologically diverse peripheral spheres of economic and cultural influence extending out to ten times that area. The cultural and technological uniformity of the Indus cities is especially striking in light of the relatively great distances among them, with separations of about {{convert|280|km|mi|abbr=on}} whereas the Mesopotamian cities, for example, only averaged about {{convert|20|to|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart.{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=35}}}}

Around 6500&amp;nbsp;BCE, agriculture emerged in [[Balochistan]], on the margins of the Indus alluvium.{{sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Dyson: &quot;The subcontinent's people were hunter-gatherers for many millennia. There were very few of them. Indeed, 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago there may only have been a couple of hundred thousand people, living in small, often isolated groups, the descendants of various 'modern' human incomers. Then, perhaps linked to events in Mesopotamia, about 8,500&amp;nbsp;years ago agriculture emerged in Baluchistan.&quot;{{sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}}}{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=33}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Fisher: &quot;The earliest discovered instance in India of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map&amp;nbsp;3.1). From as early as 7000&amp;nbsp;BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting, tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [Bos indicus] and unhumped [Bos taurus]). Castrating oxen, for instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=33}}}} In the following millennia, settled life made inroads into the Indus plains, setting the stage for the growth of rural and urban human settlements.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=138}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Coningham and Young: &quot;Mehrgarh remains one of the key sites in South Asia because it has provided the earliest known undisputed evidence for farming and pastoral communities in the region, and its plant and animal material provide clear evidence for the ongoing manipulation, and domestication, of certain species. Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context, the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely different to other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800–2000&amp;nbsp;BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984).&quot;{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=138}}}} The more organized sedentary life in turn led to a net increase in the birth rate.{{sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Dyson: &quot;In the millennia which followed, farming developed and spread slowly into the Indus valley and adjacent areas. The transition to agriculture led to population growth and the eventual rise of the Indus civilization. With the movement to settled agriculture, and the emergence of villages, towns and cities, there was probably a modest rise in the average death rate and a slightly greater rise in the birth rate.&quot;{{sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}}} The large urban centres of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to containing between 30,000 and 60,000&amp;nbsp;individuals, and during the civilization's florescence, the population of the subcontinent grew to between 4–6&amp;nbsp;million people.{{Sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Dyson: &quot;Mohenjo-daro and Harappa may each have contained between 30,000 and 60,000&amp;nbsp;people (perhaps more in the former case). Water transport was crucial for the provisioning of these and other cities. That said, the vast majority of people lived in rural areas. At the height of the Indus valley civilization the subcontinent may have contained 4-6&amp;nbsp;million people.&quot;{{Sfn|Dyson|2018|p=29}}}} During this period the death rate increased as well, for close living conditions of humans and domesticated animals led to an increase in contagious diseases.{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=33}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Fisher: &quot;Such an &quot;agricultural revolution&quot; enabled food surpluses that supported growing populations. Their largely cereal diet did not necessarily make people healthier, however, since conditions like caries and protein deficiencies can increase. Further, infectious diseases spread faster with denser living conditions of both humans and domesticated animals (which can spread measles, influenza, and other diseases to humans).&quot;{{sfn|Fisher|2018|p=33}}}}  According to one estimate, the population of the Indus civilization at its peak may have been between one and five million.{{Sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=186–187}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|McIntosh: &quot;'''Population Growth and Distribution''': &quot;The prehistory of the Indo-Iranian borderlands shows a steady increase over time in the number and density of settlements based on farming and pastoralism. In contrast, the population of the Indus plains and adjacent regions lived mainly by hunting and gathering; the limited traces suggest their settlements were far fewer in number, and were small and widely scattered, though to some extent this apparent situation must reflect the difficulty of locating hunter-gatherer settlements. The presence of domestic animals in some hunter-gatherer settlements attests to contact with the people of the border-lands, probably in the context of pastoralists' seasonal movement from the hills into the plains. The potential for population expansion in the hills was severely limited, and so, from the fourth millennium into the third, settlers moved out from the borderlands into the plains and beyond into Gujarat, the first being pastoralists, followed later by farmers. The enormous potential of the greater Indus region offered scope for huge population increase; by the end of the Mature Harappan period, the Harappans are estimated to have numbered somewhere between 1 and 5&amp;nbsp;million, probably well below the region's carrying capacity.&quot;{{Sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=186–187}}}}

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}

The first modern accounts of the [[ruins]] of the Indus civilisation are those of [[Charles Masson]], a deserter from the [[East India Company]]'s army.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}} In 1829, Masson traveled through the [[princely state]] of Punjab, gathering useful intelligence for the Company in return for a promise of clemency.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}} An aspect of this arrangement was the additional requirement to hand over to the Company any historical artifacts acquired during his travels. Masson, who had versed himself in the [[classics]], especially in the military campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]], chose for his wanderings some of the same towns that had featured in Alexander's campaigns, and whose archaeological sites had been noted by the campaign's chroniclers.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}} Masson's major archaeological discovery in the Punjab was Harappa, a metropolis of the Indus civilization in the valley of Indus's tributary, the [[Ravi River|Ravi river]]. Masson made copious notes and illustrations of Harappa's rich historical artifacts, many lying half-buried. In 1842, Masson included his observations of Harappa in the book ''Narrative of Various Journeys in Baluchistan, Afghanistan, and the Punjab''. He dated the Harappa ruins to a period of recorded history, erroneously mistaking it to have been described earlier during Alexander's campaign.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}}  Masson was impressed by the site's extraordinary size and by several large mounds formed from long-existing erosion.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Masson: &quot;A long march preceded our arrival at Haripah, through jangal of the closest description ... When I joined the camp I found it in front of the village and ruinous brick castle. Behind us was a large circular mound, or eminence, and to the west was an irregular rocky height, crowned with the remains of buildings, in fragments of walls, with niches, after the eastern manner ... Tradition affirms the existence here of a city, so considerable that it extended to Chicha Watni, thirteen [[Kos (unit)|cosses]] distant, and that it was destroyed by a particular visitation of Providence, brought down by the lust and crimes of the sovereign.&quot;{{sfn|Masson|1842|pp=452–453}} }}

Two years later, the Company contracted Alexander Burnes to sail up the Indus to assess the feasibility of water travel for its army.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}} Burnes, who also stopped in Harappa, noted the baked bricks employed in the site's ancient masonry, but noted also the haphazard plundering of these bricks by the local population.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=5–6}}

Despite these reports, Harappa was raided even more perilously for its bricks after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation of the Punjab]] in 1848–49.  A considerable number were carted away as [[track ballast]] for the [[Track (rail transport)|railway lines]] being laid in the Punjab.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=6}} Nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of railway track between [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], laid in the mid 1850s, was supported by Harappan bricks.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=6}}

In 1861, three years after the dissolution of the East India Company and the establishment of [[British Raj|Crown rule in India]], archaeology on the subcontinent became more formally organised with the founding of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI).{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=6–7}} [[Alexander Cunningham]], the Survey's first director-general, who had visited Harappa in 1853 and had noted the imposing brick walls, visited again to carry out a survey, but this time of a site whose entire upper layer had been stripped in the interim.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=6–7}}{{Sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=180}} Although his original goal of demonstrating Harappa to be a lost Buddhist city mentioned in the seventh century CE travels of the Chinese visitor, [[Xuanzang]], proved elusive,{{Sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=180}} Cunningham did publish his findings in 1875.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=7}}  For the first time, he interpreted a Harappan [[stamp seal]], with its unknown script, which he concluded to be of an origin foreign to India.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Cunningham]] (1875).

Calcutta: [[Archaeological Survey of India]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological work in Harappa thereafter flagged until a new viceroy of India, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], pushed through the [[Ancient Monuments Preservation Act 1904]], and appointed [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] to lead the ASI.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=8}} Several years later, [[Hiranand Sastri]], who had been assigned by Marshall to survey Harappa, reported it to be of non-Buddhist origin, and by implication more ancient.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=8}} [[expropriation|Expropriating]] Harappa for the ASI under the Act, Marshall directed ASI archaeologist [[Daya Ram Sahni]] to excavate the site's two mounds.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=8}}

Farther south, along the [[main stem]] of the Indus in [[Sindh|Sind]] province, the largely undisturbed site of [[Mohenjo-daro]] had attracted notice.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=8}} Marshall deputed a succession of ASI officers to survey the site. These included [[D. R. Bhandarkar]] (1911), [[R. D. Banerji]] (1919, 1922–1923), and M.S. Vats (1924).{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=8–9}} In 1923, on his second visit to Mohenjo-daro, Baneriji wrote to Marshall about the site, postulating an origin in &quot;remote antiquity,&quot; and noting a congruence of some of its artifacts with those of Harappa.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=9}} Later in 1923, Vats, also in correspondence with Marshall, noted the same more specifically about the seals and the script found at both sites.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=9}} On the weight of these opinions, Marshall ordered crucial data from the two sites to be brought to one location and invited Banerji and Sahni to a joint discussion.{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=9–10}} By 1924, Marshall had become convinced of the significance of the finds, and on 24 September 1924, made a tentative but conspicuous public intimation in the ''Illustrated London News'':{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=10}} &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;Not often has it been given to archaeologists, as it was given to [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]] at [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]], or to [[Aurel Stein|Stein]] in the deserts of [[Turkestan]], to light upon the remains of a long forgotten civilization. It looks, however, at this moment, as if we were on the threshold of such a discovery in the plains of the Indus.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Systematic excavations began in Mohenjo-daro in 1924–25 with that of [[Kashinath Narayan Dikshit|K. N. Dikshit]], continuing with those of H. Hargreaves (1925–1926), and [[Ernest J. H. Mackay]] (1927–1931).{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=8–9}} By 1931, much of Mohenjo-daro had been excavated, but occasional excavations continued, such as the one led by [[Mortimer Wheeler]], a new director-general of the ASI appointed in 1944.

After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, when most excavated sites of the Indus Valley civilisation lay in territory awarded to Pakistan, the Archaeological Survey of India, its area of authority reduced, carried out large numbers of surveys and excavations along the Ghaggar-Hakra system in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;guha_mas_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guha |first=Sudeshna |journal=Modern Asian Studies |title=Negotiating Evidence: History, Archaeology and the Indus Civilisation |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=399–426, 419 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/txt_guha_indus.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0026749X04001611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Guha: &quot;The intense explorations to locate sites related to the Indus Civilisation along the Ghaggar-Hakra, mostly by the Archaeological Survey of India immediately after Indian independence (from the 1950s through the ‘70s), although ostensibly following Sir Aurel Stein’s explorations in 1942, were to a large extent initiated by a patriotic zeal to compensate for the loss of this more ancient civilisation by the newly freed nation; as apart from Rangpur (Gujarat) and Kotla Nihang Khan (Punjab), the sites remained in Pakistan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guha_mas_2005&quot;/&gt;}} Some speculated that the Ghaggar-Hakra system might yield more sites than the Indus river basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Marc Jason |title=South Asia in World History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OQWDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-976034-3 |page=6 |quote=Immediately after the discovery of Harappan cities on the Indian side of the border, some nationalist-minded Indians began to speculate that the Ghaggar-Hakra riverbed may have more sites than neighboring Pakistan's Indus Valley. ...

Unlike India, in which after 1947, the ASI attempted to &quot;Indianise&quot; archaeological work in keeping with the new nation's goals of national unity and historical continuity, in Pakistan the national imperative was the promotion of Islamic heritage, and consequently archaeological work on early sites was left to foreign archaeologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michon2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Michon|first=Daniel |title=Archaeology and Religion in Early Northwest India: History, Theory, Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=675cCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44 |year=2015 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-317-32457-7 |pages=44ff |quote=After Partition, the archaeological work on the early historic period in India and Pakistan developed differently. In India, while the colonial administrative structure remained intact, the ASI made a concerted effort to Indianise' the field. The early historic period was understood as an important chapter in the long, unified history of the Indian subcontinent, and this understanding supported Indian goals of national unity. In Pakistan, however, the project of nation building was focused more on promoting the rich Islamic archaeological heritage within its borders, and most early historic sites, therefore, were left to the spades of foreign missions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the partition, Mortimer Wheeler, the Director of ASI from 1944, oversaw the establishment of archaeological institutions in Pakistan, later joining a UNESCO effort tasked to conserve the site at Mohenjo-daro.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=85|postscript=:Quote: &quot;At the same time he continued to spend part of the years 1949 and 1950 in Pakistan as an adviser to the Government, overseeing the establishment of the government’s Department of Archaeology in Pakistan and the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi ...

Mohenjo-daro was eventually inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980.&quot;}}  Other international efforts at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa have included the German ''[[RWTH Aachen University|Aachen]] Research Project Mohenjo-daro'', the ''Italian Mission to Mohenjo-daro'', and the US ''Harappa Archaeological Research Project (HARP)'' founded by [[George F. Dales]].{{Sfn|Wright|2009|p=14}} Following a chance flash flood which exposed a portion of an archaeological site at the foot of the [[Bolan Pass]] in [[Balochistan]],  excavations were carried out in [[Mehrgarh]] by French archaeologist [[Jean-François Jarrige]] and his team.{{Sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=109|postscript=:Quote: &quot;This model of population movement and agricultural diffusion, built on the evidence from Kili Gul Muhammad, was completely revised with the discovery of Mehrgarh at the entrance of the Bolan Pass in Baluchistan in the early 1970s by Jean-Francois Jarrige and his team (Jarrige, 1979).

== Chronology ==
{{Main|Periodisation of the Indus Valley Civilisation}}

The cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation had &quot;social hierarchies, their writing system, their large planned cities and their long-distance trade [which] mark them to archaeologists as a full-fledged 'civilisation.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandler 34–42&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chandler |first=Graham |date=September–October 1999 |title=Traders of the Plain |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199905/traders.of.the.plain.htm |journal=Saudi Aramco World |pages=34–42 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218235318/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199905/traders.of.the.plain.htm |archive-date=18 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mature phase of the Harappan civilisation lasted from c. 2600–1900&amp;nbsp;BCE. With the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures – Early Harappan and Late Harappan, respectively – the entire Indus Valley Civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th&amp;nbsp;centuries BCE. It is part of the Indus Valley Tradition, which also includes the pre-Harappan occupation of Mehrgarh, the earliest farming site of the Indus Valley.{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991}}{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=27}}

Several periodisations are employed for the periodisation of the IVC.{{sfn|Kenoyer|1991}}{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=27}} The most commonly used classifies the Indus Valley Civilisation into Early, Mature and Late Harappan Phase.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=25}} An alternative approach by Shaffer divides the broader Indus Valley Tradition into four eras, the pre-Harappan &quot;Early Food Producing Era,&quot; and the Regionalisation, Integration, and Localisation eras, which correspond roughly with the Early Harappan, Mature Harappan, and Late Harappan phases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaffer 1992 loc=I:441–464, II:425–446&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Manuel|2010|p=148}}

Lukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and [[chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of Mehrgarh,{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=114}} which &quot;suggests moderate levels of gene flow.&quot;{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=114}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|They further noted that &quot;the direct lineal descendents of the Neolithic inhabitants of Mehrgarh are to be found to the south and the east of Mehrgarh, in northwestern India and the western edge of the Deccan plateau,&quot; with neolithic Mehrgarh showing greater affinity with chalocolithic [[Inamgaon]], south of Mehrgarh, than with chalcolithic Mehrgarh.{{sfn|Coningham|Young|2015|p=114}}}} Mascarenhas et al.

Gallego Romero et al. (2011) state that their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that &quot;the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al.

The Early Harappan Ravi Phase, named after the nearby [[Ravi River]], lasted from {{Circa|3300}} BCE until 2800&amp;nbsp;BCE. It is related to the [[Hakra Ware culture|Hakra Phase]], identified in the Ghaggar-Hakra River Valley to the west, and predates the [[Kot Diji]] Phase (2800–2600&amp;nbsp;BCE, Harappan&amp;nbsp;2), named after a site in northern [[Sindh]], Pakistan, near [[Mohenjo-daro]]. The earliest examples of the [[Indus script]] date to the 3rd&amp;nbsp;millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World's Writing Systems |page=372 |author=Peter T.

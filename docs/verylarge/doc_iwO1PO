'''Historic low water'''
Lake levels tend to be the lowest in winter. The normal low-water mark is {{convert|1.00|ft|cm}} below datum (''577.5 ft or 176.0 m''). In the winter of 1964, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their lowest level at {{convert|1.38|ft|cm}} below datum.&lt;ref name=COE-2009/&gt; As with the high-water records, monthly low-water records were set each month from February 1964 through January 1965. During this twelve-month period, water levels ranged from {{convert|1.38|to(-)|0.71|ft|cm}} below Chart Datum.&lt;ref name=COE-2009/&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:Lake Huron Watershed.png|thumb|Lake Huron Basin]]
Lake Huron has the largest shore line length of any of the Great Lakes, counting its 30,000 islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,1607,7-135-3313_3677-15926--,00.html |title=Great Lakes Map |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment]] |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Huron is separated from Lake Michigan, which lies at the same level, by the {{Convert|5|mi|4 = -wide|adj = mid}}, {{Convert|20|fathom|4 = -deep|adj = mid}} [[Straits of Mackinac]], making them hydrologically the same body of water (sometimes called [[Lake Michigan-Huron]] and sometimes described as two 'lobes of the same lake').&lt;ref name=&quot;DEQ&quot;/&gt; Aggregated, Lake Huron-Michigan, at {{convert|45300|sqmi|km²}}, &quot;is technically the world's largest freshwater lake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEQ&quot;/&gt; When counted separately, Lake Superior is {{convert|8700|mi2}} larger than Huron and higher. Lake Superior drains into the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|St. Marys River]] which then flows southward into Lake Huron. The water then flows south to the [[St. Clair River]], at Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario.

The [[Great Lakes Waterway]] continues thence to [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]]; the [[Detroit River]] and [[Detroit]], Michigan; into [[Lake Erie]] and thence – via [[Lake Ontario]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]] – to the Atlantic Ocean.

Like the other Great Lakes, it was formed by melting ice as the continental glaciers retreated toward the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. Before this, Lake Huron was a low-lying depression through which flowed the now-buried Laurentian and Huronian Rivers; the lake bed was criss-crossed by a large network of tributaries to these ancient waterways, with many of the old channels still evident on bathymetric maps.

===Alpena-Amberley Ridge===
The Alpena-Amberley Ridge is an ancient ridge beneath the surface of Lake Huron, running roughly between Alpena, Michigan and [[Point Clark, Ontario|Point Clark]], Ontario. About 9,000 years ago, when water levels in Lake Huron were about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} below today's levels, the ridge was exposed and the [[land bridge]] was used as a migration route for large herds of [[caribou]]. Since 2008, archaeologists have discovered at least 60 stone constructions along the submerged ridge that are thought to have been used as hunting blinds by [[Paleo-Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Weber | first = Bob | title = Prehistoric Stone Walls Found Under Lake Huron |work= CTV News | date =  29 April 2014 | url = http://london.ctvnews.ca/prehistoric-stone-walls-found-under-lake-huron-1.1797631|agency=The Canadian Press |accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darlinton map of lake huron 1680.png|thumb|upright=0.9| left |1680 British map of Lake Huron]]
The extent of development among Eastern Woodlands Native American societies on the eve of European contact is indicated by the archaeological evidence of a town on or near Lake Huron that contained more than one hundred large structures housing a total population of between 4,000 and 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Gary B. ''Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America'' Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The French, the first European visitors to the region, often referred to Lake Huron as La Mer Douce, &quot;the fresh-water sea&quot;. In 1656, a map by French cartographer [[Nicolas Sanson]] refers to the lake by the name ''{{lang|wya|Karegnondi}}'', a [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] word which has been variously translated as &quot;Freshwater Sea&quot;, &quot;Lake of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]s&quot;, or simply &quot;lake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_14tuSMUBcC&amp;pg=PA221 | title=Huron-Wendat: The Heritage of the Circle |last=Sioui |first= Georges E. |translator-first=Jane |translator-last=Brierley |translator-link=Jane Brierley | publisher=UBC Press | isbn=9780774807159 | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fj6&gt;{{cite news|last=Fonger|first=Ron|title=Genesee, Oakland counties adopt historic name for water group|url=http://blog.mlive.com/flintjournal/newsnow/2007/05/genesee_oakland_counties_adopt.html|accessdate=6 December 2011|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was generally labeled &quot;Lac des Hurons&quot; (Lake of the Huron) on most early European maps.&lt;ref name=fj6/&gt; By the 1860s, many European settlements on the shores of Lake Huron were becoming [[Incorporated town|incorporated]], including [[Sarnia]], the largest city on Lake Huron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/archives/exhibits/showcase-150/online|title=Lake Huron at the time of Confederation|website=University of Toronto Archives: Showcase 150|access-date=28 Jan 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storm of 1913===
[[File:Lake-huron-ipperwash-beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.09|right|Ipperwash Beach, Lake Huron]]
{{Main|Great Lakes Storm of 1913|Great Storms of the North American Great Lakes}}

On November 9, 1913, the Great Lakes Storm of 1913 in Lake Huron sank ten ships and more than twenty were driven ashore.  The storm, which raged for 16 hours, killed 235 seamen.&lt;ref&gt;''True Tales of the Great Lakes'', by Dwight Boyer; p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matoa'' had passed between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, just after midnight. On November 9, just after six in the morning, ''Senator'' pushed upstream. Less than an hour later, ''Manola'' passed through. Captain Frederick W. Light of ''Manola'' reported that both the Canadian and the American weather stations had storm flag signals flying from their weather towers.&lt;ref&gt;''True Tales of the Great Lakes'', by Dwight Boyer; p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Following behind at 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. that Sunday, ''Regina'' steamed out of Sarnia into the northwest gale. The warnings now had been up for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;''True Tales of the Great Lakes'', by Dwight Boyer; p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manola'' passed ''Regina'' off Port Sanilac, {{convert|22|smi|nmi km}} up the lake. Captain Light determined that if it continued to deteriorate, he would seek shelter at [[Harbor Beach, Michigan|Harbor Beach]], Michigan, another {{convert|30|smi|nmi km}} up the lake. There, he could seek shelter behind the breakwater. Before he reached Harbor Beach, the winds turned to the northeast and the lake began to rise. It would be noon before he reached Harbor Beach and ran for shelter. The waves were so violent that ''Manola'' touched bottom entering the harbor. With help from a [[tugboat]], ''Manola'' tied up to the break wall with eight lines. It was about 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. when ''Manola'' was secured and the crew prepared to drop anchor. As they worked, the cables began to snap from wind pressure against the hull. To keep from being pushed aground, they kept their bow into the wind with the engines running half to full in turns, yet the ship still drifted {{convert|800|ft}} before its movement was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;''Freshwater Fury'' by Frank Barcus, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Waves breaking over the ship damaged several windows and the crew reported seeing portions of the concrete break wall peeling off as the waves struck it.&lt;ref&gt;''True Tales of the Great Lakes'', by Dwight Boyer, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, fifty miles farther up the lake, ''Matoa'' and Captain Hugh McLeod had to ride out the storm without a safe harbor.&lt;ref&gt;''True Tales of the Great Lakes'', by Dwight Boyer, pp. 272-73&lt;/ref&gt; ''Matoa'' would be found stranded on the [[Port Austin, Michigan|Port Austin]] reef when the winds subsided.&lt;ref&gt;''Shipwrecks of Lake Huron . . . The Great Sweetwater Sea'', Jack Parker, Avery Color Studios, [[Au Train, Michigan]], 1986, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; It was noon on Monday before the winds let up and not until 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. that night before Captain Light determined it to be safe to continue his journey.&lt;ref&gt;''Freshwater Fury'' by Frank Barcus, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shipwrecks==
{{See also|Great_Lakes#Shipwrecks|l1=Shipwrecks in the Great Lakes}}

More than a thousand wrecks have been recorded in Lake Huron. These purportedly include the first European vessel to sail the Great Lakes, ''[[Le Griffon]]'', built in 1679 on the eastern shore of Lake Erie, near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Robert Cavalier, [[Sieur de la Salle]] navigated across Lake Erie, up the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River out into Lake Huron. Passing the Straits of Mackinac, La Salle and ''Le Griffon'' made landfall on [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)|Washington Island]], off the tip of the [[Door Peninsula]] on the Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan. Here, La Salle filled ''Le Griffon'' with pelts and in late November 1679 sent ''Le Griffon'' back to the site of modern-day Buffalo, never to be seen again.

Two wrecks have been identified as ''Le Griffon'', although neither has gained final verification as the actual wreck. Blown by a fierce storm after leaving, ''Le Griffon'' ran aground before the storm. The people of Manitoulin Island say that the wreck in Mississagi Straits at the western tip of the island is that of ''Le Griffon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWAg1y9FkdQC&amp;q=+La+Salle&amp;pg=PA72 |title=Lasalle's Griffin? |last=Allen |first=Durward L. |magazine=Boys' Life |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |date=September 1959 |pages=19, 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;themississagilighthouse.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.themississagilighthouse.com/ships.html |title=Mississagi Lighthouse |access-date=2013-07-01 |archive-date=2013-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712005812/http://www.themississagilighthouse.com/ships.html |url-status=bot: unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigansotherside.com/Articles/Griffon.htm The Griffon - First Ghost Ship on the Great Lakes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623203610/http://www.michigansotherside.com/Articles/Griffon.htm |date=2009-06-23 }}.

===Georgian Bay, North Channel===
Georgian Bay, the largest bay on Lake Huron, contains 212 of the 1,000 sunken vessels in the lake.&lt;ref&gt;''Shipwrecks of Lake Huron . . . The Great Sweetwater Sea'', Jack Parker, Avery Color Studios, Au Train, Michigan, 1986, pp. 65-77&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manola'', a propeller freighter of 2,325 gross tons, was built in 1890 by the Globe Shipping Company of [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  It was operated by the Minnesota Steamship Company (Cleveland) from 1890 to 1901, and by the Pittsburgh Steamship Company from 1901 to 1918.  On January 25, 1918, ''Manola'' was sold to the U.S. Shipping Board. It was sold again in 1920 to the Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., and renamed ''Mapledawn''. The vessel became stranded on November 20, 1924, on Christian Island&lt;ref&gt;''Shipwrecks of Lake Huron . . . The Great Sweetwater Sea'', Jack Parker, Avery Color Studios, Au Train, Michigan, 1986, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; in Georgian Bay. Headed for Port McNichol, Ontario, it was declared a total loss after two weeks. Salvagers were able to recover approximately 75,000 bushels of barley for delivery to Midland, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Lakes Vessels Index''; Historical Collections of the Great Lakes; Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Lake Huron.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Lake Huron viewed from Arch Rock at [[Mackinac Island]]]]
Lake Huron has a [[lake retention time]] of 22 years.

Like all of the Great Lakes, the ecology of Lake Huron has undergone drastic changes in the last century. The lake originally supported a native deepwater fish community dominated by [[lake trout]], which fed on a number of deepwater [[Cisco (fish)|cisco]]s as well as [[sculpins]] and other native fishes. Several [[invasive species]], including [[sea lamprey]], [[alewife (fish)|alewife]] and [[rainbow smelt]], became abundant in the lake by the 1930s. The major native top predator, lake trout, were virtually extirpated from the lake by 1950 due to a combination of overfishing and the effects of sea lamprey. Several species of deepwater ciscos were also extirpated from the lake by the 1960s; the only remaining native deepwater cisco is the [[Coregonus hoyi|bloater]]. Nonnative [[Pacific salmon]] have been stocked in the lake since the 1960s, and lake trout have also been stocked in an attempt to rehabilitate the species, although little natural reproduction of stocked trout has been observed.

Lake Huron has suffered recently due to the introduction of a variety of new invasive species, including [[Zebra mussel|zebra]] and [[quagga mussel]]s, the [[spiny water flea]], and [[round goby|round gobies]].  The deepwater [[demersal]] fish community of the lake was in a state of collapse by 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Riley, S. C. et al. 2008. &quot;Deepwater demersal fish community collapse in Lake Huron&quot;. ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'' 137: 1879-1880.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of drastic changes have been observed in the zooplankton community of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Barbiero, R. P. et al.  2009. &quot;Recent shifts in the crustacean zooplankton community of Lake Huron&quot;. ''Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'' 66: 816-828.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinook salmon]] catches have also been greatly reduced in recent years, and [[lake whitefish]] have become less abundant and are in poor condition. These recent changes may be attributable to the new exotic species.

'''Feminist literary criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] informed by [[feminist theory]], or more broadly, by the politics of [[feminism]]. It uses the principles and ideology of feminism to critique the language of literature. This school of thought seeks to analyze and describe the ways in which literature portrays the narrative of male domination by exploring the economic, social, political, and psychological forces embedded within literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/722/11/|title=Literary Theory and Schools of Criticism|publisher=[[Purdue OWL]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking and criticizing works can be said to have changed the way literary texts are viewed and studied, as well as changing and expanding the [[Western canon|canon]] of what is commonly taught. It is used a lot in Greek myths.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Feminist Literary Criticism|last1=Plain|first1=Gill|last2=Sellers|first2=Susan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, feminist literary criticism has sought to examine old texts within literary canon through a new lens. Specific goals of feminist criticism include both the development and discovery female tradition of writing, and rediscovering of old texts, while also interpreting symbolism of women's writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view and resisting sexism inherent in the majority of mainstream literature. These goals, along with the intent to analyze women writers and their writings from a female perspective, and increase awareness of the sexual politics of language and style&lt;ref&gt;Tuttle, Lisa: Encyclopedia of feminism. Harlow: Longman 1986, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; were developed by [[Lisa Tuttle]] in the 1980s, and have since been adopted by a majority of feminist critics.

The history of feminist literary criticism is extensive, from classic works of nineteenth-century women authors such as [[George Eliot]] and [[Margaret Fuller]] to cutting-edge theoretical work in [[women's studies]] and [[gender studies]] by &quot;[[third-wave feminism|third-wave]]&quot; authors. Before the 1970s—in the [[first-wave feminism|first]] and [[second-wave feminism|second wave]]s of feminism—feminist literary criticism was concerned with women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within the literature; in particular the depiction of fictional female characters. In addition, feminist literary criticism is concerned with the exclusion of women from the literary canon, with theorists such as Lois Tyson suggesting that this is because the views of women authors are often not considered to be universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory: A User Friendly Guide 2nd Edition|url=https://archive.org/details/criticaltheoryto00tyso_624|url-access=limited|last=Tyson|first=Lois|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-61617-1|location=270 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10016|pages=[https://archive.org/details/criticaltheoryto00tyso_624/page/n123 107], 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, feminist criticism has been closely associated with the birth and growth of [[queer studies]]. Modern feminist literary theory seeks to understand both the literary portrayals and representation of both women and people in the queer community, expanding the role of a variety of identities and analysis within feminist literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory 3rd Edition|last1=Raman|first1=Selden|last2=Widdowson|first2=Peter|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=1993|isbn=978-0813108162|location=Lexington, Kentucky|pages=[https://archive.org/details/readersguide00seld/page/238 238, 239]|url=https://archive.org/details/readersguide00seld/page/238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods employed==
Feminist scholarship has developed a variety of ways to unpack literature in order to understand its essence through a feminist lens. Scholars under the camp known as Feminine Critique sought to divorce literary analysis away from abstract diction-based arguments and instead tailored their criticism to more &quot;grounded&quot; pieces of literature (plot, characters, etc.) and recognize the perceived implicit misogyny of the structure of the story itself. Others schools of thought such as [[gynocriticism]]—which is considered a 'female' perspective on women's writings—uses a historicist approach to literature by exposing exemplary female scholarship in literature and the ways in which their relation to gender structure relayed in their portrayal of both fiction and reality in their texts. Gynocriticism was introduced during the time of second wave feminism. [[Elaine Showalter]] suggests that feminist critique is an &quot;ideological, righteous, angry, and admonitory search for the sins and errors of the past,&quot; and says gynocriticism enlists &quot;the grace of imagination in a disinterested search for the essential difference of women's writing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Lanser, Susan S. &quot;Feminist Literary Criticism: How Feminist? How Literary? How Critical?.&quot; ''NWSA Journal'' 3.1 (1991): 3. ''Academic Search Complete''.&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporary scholars attempt to understand the intersecting points of femininity and complicate our common assumptions about gender politics by accessing different categories of identity (race, class, sexual orientation, etc.) The ultimate goal of any of these tools is to uncover and expose patriarchal underlying tensions within novels and interrogate the ways in which our basic literary assumptions about such novels are contingent on female subordination. In this way, the accessibility of literature broadens to a far more inclusive and holistic population. Moreover, works that historically received little or no attention, given the historical constraints around female authorship in some cultures, are able to be heard in their original form and unabridged. This makes a broader collection of literature for all readers insofar as all great works of literature are given exposure without bias towards a gender influenced system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/virtualit/poetry/critical_define/crit_femin.html|title=Bedford / St. Martin's|accessdate=29 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901143656/http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/Virtualit/poetry/critical_define/crit_femin.html|archivedate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have also begun to employ anti-patriarchal themes to protest the historical censorship of literature written by women. The rise of decadent [[feminist literature]] in the 1990s was meant to directly challenge the sexual politics of the patriarchy. By employing a wide range of female [[sexual exploration]] and lesbian and queer identities by those like Rita Felski and Judith Bennet, women were able attract more attention about feminist topics in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=398842d6-fc94-48bc-84be-1f4e5f7ea20c%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=112|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the development of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity and [[third-wave feminism]], feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes, namely in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]'s [[critical theory]], which analyzes how the dominant ideology of a subject influences societal understanding. It has also considered gender in the terms of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]], as part of the [[deconstruction]] of existing relations of power, and as a concrete political investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;&gt;Barry, Peter, 'Feminist Literary Criticism' in ''Beginning theory'' (Manchester University Press: 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more traditionally central feminist concern with the representation and politics of women's lives has continued to play an active role in criticism. More specifically, modern feminist criticism deals with those issues related to the perceived intentional and unintentional patriarchal programming within key aspects of society including education, politics and the work force.

When looking at literature, modern feminist literary critics also seek ask how feminist, literary, and critical the critique practices are, with scholars such as Susan Lanser looking to improve both literature analysis and the analyzer's own practices to be more diverse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==History and critics==
While the beginning of more mainstream feminist literary criticism is typically considered during second-wave feminism, there are multiple texts prior to that era that contributed greatly to the field. Feminist literary criticism can be traced back to medieval times, with some arguing that Geoffrey Chaucer's Wife of Bath could be an example of early feminist literary critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Additionally, the period considered First wave feminism also contributed extensively to literature and women's presence within it. For example, 1929's [[A Room of One's Own]] by Virginia Woolf is undoubtedly considered one of these formative texts. In it, Woolf argues that in order to write creatively and be critically successful, a woman must be able to own her own space and financial stability. And though the basis of the plot is around a Woolf speaking at a conference for women's literature, she speculates that there is still a long way to go for women and so-called 'women's issues' in creative space, especially based on the differences in educational quality Woolf observed between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Room of One's Own|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|publisher=Martino Fine Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1614272779|location=Eastford, CT 06242|pages=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern feminist literary criticism finds most of its roots in the 1960s second-wave feminist movements. Beginning with the interrogation of male-centric literature that portrayed women in a demeaning and oppressed model, theorists such as Mary Ellman, Kate Millet and [[Germaine Greer]] challenged past imaginations of the feminine within literary scholarship. Within second-wave feminism, three phases can be defined: the feminine phase, the feminist phase, and the female phase. During the feminine phase, female writers adhered to male values. In the feminist phase, there was a theme of criticism of women's role in society. And in the female phase, it was now assumed that women's works were valid, and the works were less combative than in the feminist phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://writersinspire.org/content/feminist-approaches-literature|title=Feminist Approaches to Literature {{!}} Great Writers Inspire|website=writersinspire.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Lanser suggested changing the name of feminist literary criticism to &quot;critical literary feminism&quot; to change the focus from the criticism to the feminism, and points out that writing such works requires &quot;consciousness of political context.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In a similar vein, Elaine Showalter became a leading critic in the gynocritical method with her work ''A Literature of their Own'' in 1977. By this time, scholars were not only interested in simply demarcating narratives of oppression but also creating a literary space for past, present and future female literary scholars to substantiate their experience in a genuine way that appreciates the aesthetic form of their works.

Additionally, Black literary feminist scholars began to emerge, in the post-Civil Rights era of the United States, as a response to the masculine-centric narratives of Black empowerments began to gain momentum over female voices. Although not a &quot;critical&quot; text, ''The Black Woman: An Anthology'', edited by Cade (1970) is seen as essential to the rise of Black literary criticism and theory. Its compilation of poems, short stories and essays gave rise to new institutionally supported forms of Black literary scholarship. The [[Combahee River Collective]] released what is called one of the most famous pieces in Black literary scholarship known as &quot;A Black Feminist Statement&quot; (1977), which sought to prove that literary feminism was an important component to black female liberation.

In 1979 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar published [[The Madwoman in the Attic]], an analysis of women's poetry and prose, and how it fits into the larger feminist literary canon. This publication has become a staple of feminist criticism and has expanded the realm of publications considered to be feminist works, especially in the 19th century. The book specifically argues that women have largely been considered in two distinct categories by men in academia, monsters or angels. Gilbert and Gubar argued that being trapped in these categories regulated women writers to specific areas of literature and writing, leaving the rest open only to men, and causing a distinct anxiety in women's writers to stay specifically within those categories or be ridiculed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Madwoman In the Attic 2nd Edition|last1=Gilbert|first1=Sandra|last2=Gubar|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0300084580|location=London|pages=45–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert and Gubar's specific focus on literary criticism in the realm of poetry and other short pieces has expanded the possibilities of feminist literary contributions today, as they were previously seen as less valid than longer works. Today, writers like [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa]] have been able to contribute to the feminist canon, while still working with writing forms other than full-sized novels.

In the 1980s, [[Hazel Carby]], [[Barbara Christian]], [[bell hooks]], [[Nellie Y. McKay|Nellie McKay]], [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]], [[Hortense Spillers]], Eleanor Traylor, [[Cheryl Wall]] and Sheryl Ann Williams all contributed heavily to the Black Feminist Scholarship of the period. During that same time, [[Deborah E. McDowell]] published ''New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism'', which called for a more theoretical school of criticism versus the current writings, which she deemed overly practical. In this essay McDowell also extensively discussed black women's portrayal in literature, and how it came across as even more negative than white women's portrayal. As time moved forward, the theory began to disperse in ideology. Many decided to shift towards the nuanced psychological factors of the Black experience and further away from broad sweeping generalizations. Others began to connect their works to the politics of lesbianism. Some decided to analyze the Black experience through their relationship to the Western world. Regardless, these scholars continue to employ a variety of methods to explore the identity of Black feminism in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=def1ba3e-5b36-406d-be55-510c610a09f1%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=112|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French scholars such as [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]] introduced psychoanalytic discourses into their work by way of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan as a way to truly &quot;get to the root&quot; of feminine anxieties within text to manifest broader societal truths about the place of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writersinspire.org/content/feminist-approaches-literature|title=Feminist Approaches to Literature|publisher=|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, Matrix and Metramorphosis. ''Differences'', Vol.4, N.3,. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger ''The Matrixial Borderspace''. University of Minnesota Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Current feminist scholars in the field of literature include [[Hortense Spillers]], Nancy Armstrong, Annette Kolodny and Irene Tayler who all come from a variety of backgrounds who use their own nuanced and subjective experiences to inform their understanding of feminist literature. Currently, several university scholars all employ the usage of literary feminism when critiquing texts. The mainstreaming of this school has given academia an extremely useful tool in raising questions over the gender relationships within texts.

==Modern applications==

As with other aspects of feminist theory, over the course of the second half of twentieth century feminist literary criticism has expanded to include a significantly broader spectrum of identities under the umbrella term of 'feminism'. Third wave feminist theory and beyond has striven to include more identities and aspects of [[intersectionality]], and feminist literary criticism has followed suit. Third wave feminism and feminist literary criticism is concerned more with the intersection of race and other feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=VanNewkirk|first1=Robbin Hillary|title=Third Wave Feminist History and the Politics of Being Visible and Being Real|url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=wsi_theses|website=ScholarWorks @ Georgia State University|publisher=Georgia State University|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the variety and nature of texts examined has grown to include more texts from transnational perspective, while still maintaining its roots in analyzing how male dominated society effects the interpretation and creation of literature. At the same time, new feminist literary critics examine the universal images used by women writers to uncover the unconscious symbolism women have used to describe themselves, their world, female society across time and nationalities to uncover the specifically feminine language in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorski|first1=Hedwig Irene|title=The Riddle of Correspondences in A. S. Byatt's ''Possession: A Romance'' with H. D.'s ''Trilogy''|date=23 August 2018|isbn=978-1725926462}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Feminist literature and criticism minimize the focus on male influences and disruptions in a woman's text by socio-political hegemony to better uncover the universal unconscious of the female mind in its own context.

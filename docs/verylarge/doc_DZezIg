Armed guards were posted at the camps, which were all in remote, desolate areas far from population centers. Internees were typically allowed to stay with their families. There are documented instances of guards shooting internees who reportedly attempted to walk outside the fences. One such shooting, that of James Wakasa at Topaz, led to a re-evaluation of the security measures in the camps. Some camp administrations eventually allowed relatively free movement outside the marked boundaries of the camps. Nearly a quarter of the internees left the camps to live and work elsewhere in the United States, outside the exclusion zone. Eventually, some were authorized to return to their hometowns in the exclusion zone under supervision of a sponsoring American family or agency whose loyalty had been assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The phrase &quot;''[[shikata ga nai]]''&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;it cannot be helped&quot;) was commonly used to summarize the interned families' resignation to their helplessness throughout these conditions. This was noticed by their children, as mentioned in the well-known memoir ''[[Farewell to Manzanar]]'' by [[Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston]] and [[James D. Houston]]. Further, it is noted that parents may have internalized these emotions to withhold their disappointment and anguish from affecting their children. Nevertheless, children still were cognizant of this emotional repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

====Medical care====
Before the war, 87 physicians and surgeons, 137 nurses, 105 dentists, 132 pharmacists, 35 optometrists, and 92 lab technicians provided healthcare to the Japanese American population, with most practicing in urban centers like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. As the eviction from the West Coast was carried out, the Wartime Civilian Control Administration worked with the [[United States Public Health Service]] (USPHS) and many of these professionals to establish infirmaries within the temporary assembly centers. An Issei doctor was appointed to manage each facility, and additional healthcare staff worked under his supervision, although the USPHS recommendation of one physician for every 1,000 inmates and one nurse to 200 inmates was not met. Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions forced assembly center infirmaries to prioritize inoculations over general care, obstetrics, and surgeries; at Manzanar, for example, hospital staff performed over 40,000 immunizations against typhoid and smallpox.&lt;ref name=Fiset&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiset |first=Louis |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Medical%20care%20in%20camp/ |title=Medical care in camp |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=compared to how many general care/ob/surgery patients?|date=April 2015}} Food poisoning was common and also demanded significant attention. Those who were interned in Topaz, Minidoka, and Jerome experienced outbreaks of [[dysentery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandler, Martin 2013&quot;/&gt;

Facilities in the more permanent &quot;relocation centers&quot; eventually surpassed the makeshift assembly center infirmaries, but in many cases these hospitals were incomplete when inmates began to arrive and were not fully functional for several months. Additionally, vital medical supplies such as medications and surgical and sterilization equipment were limited. The staff shortages suffered in the assembly centers continued in the WRA camps. The administration's decision to invert the management structure and demote Japanese American medical workers to positions below white employees, while capping their pay rate at a $20/month, further exacerbated this problem. (At Heart Mountain, for example, Japanese American doctors received $19/month compared to white nurses' $150/month.)&lt;ref&gt;Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation. &quot;[http://www.heartmountain.org/lifeincamp.html Life in Camp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329155654/http://www.heartmountain.org/lifeincamp.html |date=March 29, 2019 }}&quot; Retrieved November 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chem.nwc.cc.wy.us/HMDP/history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304013224/http://chem.nwc.cc.wy.us/HMDP/history.htm |archive-date=2008-03-04 |url-status=dead |title=A Brief History of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center and the Japanese American Experience |work=chem.nwc.cc.wy.us |last=Mackey |first=Mike |access-date=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused a shortage of healthcare professionals across the country, and the camps often lost potential recruits to outside hospitals that offered better pay and living conditions. When the WRA began to allow some Japanese Americans to leave camp, many [[Nikkei people|Nikkei]] medical professionals resettled outside camp. Those who remained had little authority in administration of the hospitals. Combined with the inequitable payment of salaries between white and Japanese American employees, conflicts arose at several hospitals, and there were two Japanese American walk-outs at Heart Mountain in 1943.&lt;ref name=Fiset/&gt;

Despite a shortage of healthcare workers, limited access to equipment, and tension between white administrators and Japanese American staff, these hospitals provided much needed medical care in camp. The extreme climates of the remote incarceration sites were hard on infants and elderly prisoners. The frequent dust storms of the high desert locations led to increased cases of asthma and [[coccidioidomycosis]], while the swampy, mosquito-infested Arkansas camps exposed residents to [[malaria]], all of which were treated in camp. Almost 6,000 live deliveries were performed in these hospitals, and all mothers received pre- and postnatal care. The WRA recorded 1,862 deaths across the ten camps, with cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis, and vascular disease accounting for the majority.&lt;ref name=Fiset/&gt;

Although life in the camps was very difficult, Japanese Americans formed many different sports teams, including baseball and football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/japanese-americans-at-manzanar.htm|title = Japanese Americans at Manzanar|access-date = February 10, 2015|website = National Park Service|publisher = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued what came to be known as the &quot;Green Light Letter&quot; to MLB Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], which urged him to continue playing [[Major League Baseball]] games despite the ongoing war. In it Roosevelt said that &quot;baseball provides a recreation&quot;, and this was true for Japanese American incarcerees as well. Over 100 baseball teams were formed in the Manzanar camp so that Japanese Americans could have some recreation, and some of the team names were carry-overs from teams formed before the incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/upshot/for-incarcerated-japanese-americans-baseball-was-wearing-the-american-flag.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1|title = For Incarcerated Japanese-Americans, Baseball Was 'Wearing the American Flag'|date = June 20, 2014|access-date = February 10, 2015|website = New York Times|publisher = NY Times|last = Michael|first = Beschloss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women participated in the sports. In some cases, the Japanese American baseball teams from the camps traveled to outside communities to play other teams.

===Student leave to attend Eastern colleges===
Although most Nisei college students followed their families into camp, a small number tried to arrange for transfers to schools outside the exclusion zone in order to continue their education. Their initial efforts expanded as sympathetic college administrators and the [[American Friends Service Committee]] began to coordinate a larger student relocation program. The Friends petitioned WRA Director Milton Eisenhower to place college students in Eastern and Midwestern academic institutions. The National Japanese American Student Relocation Council was formed on May 29, 1942, and the AFSC administered the program.&lt;ref name=NJASRC&gt;{{cite web|last=Austin |first=Allan W. |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/National%20Japanese%20American%20Student%20Relocation%20Council/ |title=National Japanese American Student Relocation Council |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By September 1942, after the initial roundup of Japanese Americans, 250 students from assembly centers and WRA camps were back at school.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Their tuition, book costs, and living expenses were absorbed by the U.S. government, private foundations, and church scholarships, in addition to significant fundraising efforts led by Issei parents in camp. Outside camp, the students took on the role of &quot;ambassadors of good will&quot;, and the NJASRC and WRA promoted this image to soften anti-Japanese prejudice and prepare the public for the resettlement of Japanese Americans in their communities.&lt;ref name=NJASRC/&gt; At [[Earlham College]], President William Dennis helped institute a program that enrolled several dozen Japanese-American students in order to spare them from incarceration. While this action was controversial in [[Richmond, IN|Richmond, Indiana]], it helped strengthen the college's ties to Japan and the Japanese-American community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.earlham.edu/~jpnstudies/documents/pdf/historical_brochure.pdf Historical brochure], Earlham College {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415100752/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~jpnstudies/documents/pdf/historical_brochure.pdf |date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Oberlin College]], about 40 evacuated Nisei students were enrolled.

In early 1943, War Relocation Authority officials, working with the War Department and the Office of Naval Intelligence,&lt;ref name='Lyon-LQ'&gt;Cherstin M. Lyon. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Loyalty%20questionnaire/ &quot;Loyalty questionnaire,&quot;] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; circulated a questionnaire in an attempt to determine the loyalty of incarcerated Nisei men they hoped to recruit into military service. The &quot;Statement of United States Citizen of Japanese Ancestry&quot; was initially given only to Nisei who were eligible for service (or would have been, but for the 4-C classification imposed on them at the start of the war). Authorities soon revised the questionnaire and required all adults in camp to complete the form. Most of the 28 questions were designed to assess the &quot;Americanness&quot; of the respondent — had they been educated in Japan or the U.S.? were they Buddhist or Christian? did they practice ''judo'' or play on a baseball team?&lt;ref name='Lyon-LQ'/&gt; The final two questions on the form, which soon came to be known as the &quot;loyalty questionnaire&quot;, were more direct:

{{quote|Question 27: Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty, wherever ordered?

Question 28: Will you swear unqualified allegiances to the United States of America and faithfully defend the United States from any and all attack by foreign or domestic forces, and forswear any form of allegiance or obedience to the Japanese emperor, or other foreign government, power or organization?}}

Across the camps, people who answered No to both questions became known as &quot;No Nos&quot;.

While most camp inmates simply answered &quot;yes&quot; to both questions, several thousand — 17 percent of the total respondents, 20 percent of the Nisei&lt;ref name='Lyon-Seg'&gt;Cherstin M. Lyon. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Segregation/ &quot;Segregation,&quot;] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed March 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; — gave negative or qualified replies out of confusion, fear or anger at the wording and implications of the questionnaire. In regard to Question 27, many worried that expressing a willingness to serve would be equated with volunteering for combat, while others felt insulted at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and their families. An affirmative answer to Question 28 brought up other issues. Some believed that renouncing their loyalty to Japan would suggest that they had at some point been loyal to Japan and disloyal to the United States. Many believed they were to be deported to Japan no matter how they answered; they feared an explicit disavowal of the Emperor would become known and make such resettlement extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lyon |first1=Cherstin |title=Questions 27 and 28 |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Questions_27_and_28/ |website=encyclopedia.densho.org |access-date=1 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okihiro |first1=Gary Y. |title=Encyclopedia of Japanese American Internment |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-39916-9 |page=124 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfFcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124 |access-date=2 February 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 1943, Tule Lake, the site with the highest number of &quot;no&quot; responses to the questionnaire, was designated to house inmates whose answers suggested they were &quot;disloyal&quot;.&lt;ref name='Lyon-Seg'/&gt; During the remainder of 1943 and into early 1944, more than 12,000 men, women and children were transferred from other camps to the maximum-security Tule Lake Segregation Center. The documentary, ''[http://www.resistanceattulelake.com/ Resistance at Tule Lake]'', conveys the tensions and conditions there. 

Afterward, the government passed the [[Renunciation Act of 1944]], a law that made it possible for Nisei and [[Kibei]] to [[Renunciation of United States citizenship|renounce their American citizenship]].&lt;ref name='Lyon-LQ'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Justice Denied |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/research/japanese-americans/justice-denied/chapter-7.pdf |website=National Archives |access-date=1 February 2020 |language=en |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okihiro |first1=Gary Y. |title=Encyclopedia of Japanese American Internment |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-39916-9 |pages=19, 282 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfFcAQAAQBAJ |access-date=1 February 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 5,589 internees opted to do so; 5,461 of these were sent to Tule Lake.&lt;ref name=tulelake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulelake.org/2004-pilgrimage/ |title=Tule Lake Committee - tulelake.org |publisher=tulelake.org |access-date=January 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227044219/http://www.tulelake.org/2004-pilgrimage/ |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who renounced US citizenship, 1,327 were repatriated to Japan.&lt;ref name=tulelake/&gt; Those persons who stayed in the US faced discrimination from the Japanese-American community, both during and after the war, for having made that choice of renunciation. At the time, they feared what their futures held were they to remain American, and remain interned.&lt;ref name=tulelake/&gt;

These renunciations of American citizenship have been highly controversial, for a number of reasons. Some apologists for internment have cited the renunciations as evidence that &quot;disloyalty&quot; or [[anti-Americanism]] was well represented among the interned peoples, thereby justifying the internment.&lt;ref&gt;Malkin, Michelle. ''In Defense of Internment''. 2004, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians have dismissed the latter argument, for its failure to consider that the small number of individuals in question had been mistreated and persecuted by their own government at the time of the &quot;renunciation&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Wendy L. ''Japanese American Internment During World War II''. 2002, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=niiya293&gt;Niiya, Brian. ''Japanese American History''. 1993, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he renunciations had little to do with &quot;loyalty&quot; or &quot;disloyalty&quot; to the United States, but were instead the result of a series of complex conditions and factors that were beyond the control of those involved. Prior to discarding citizenship, most or all of the renunciants had experienced the following misfortunes: forced removal from homes; loss of jobs; government and public assumption of disloyalty to the land of their birth based on race alone; and incarceration in a &quot;segregation center&quot; for &quot;disloyal&quot; ISSEI or NISEI...&lt;ref name=niiya293 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minoru Kiyota, who was among those who renounced his citizenship and soon came to regret the decision, has said that he wanted only &quot;to express my fury toward the government of the United States&quot;, for his internment and for the mental and physical duress, as well as the intimidation, he was made to face.&lt;ref name=ngai&gt;Ngai, Mae M. ''Impossible Subjects''. 2004, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[M]y renunciation had been an expression of momentary emotional defiance in reaction to years of persecution suffered by myself and other Japanese Americans and, in particular, to the degrading interrogation by the FBI agent at [[Topaz War Relocation Center|Topaz]] and being terrorized by the guards and gangs at [[Tule Lake War Relocation Center|Tule Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiyota, Minoru and Keenan, Linda Klepinger. ''Beyond Loyalty''. 1997, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Civil rights attorney [[Wayne M.

When the government began seeking army volunteers from among the camps, only 6% of military-aged male inmates volunteered to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most of those who refused tempered that refusal with statements of willingness to fight if they were restored their rights as American citizens.

The [[100th Infantry Battalion]], which was formed in June 1942 with 1,432 men of Japanese descent from the [[Hawaii National Guard]], was sent to Camps McCoy and Shelby for advanced training.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia.densho.org/100th%20Infantry%20Battalion/&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the 100th's superior training record, the War Department authorized the formation of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]]. When the call was made, 10,000 young men from Hawaii volunteered with eventually 2,686 being chosen along with 1,500 from the continental U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia.densho.org/442nd%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team/&lt;/ref&gt; The 100th Infantry Battalion landed in Salerno, Italy in September 1943 and became known as the Purple Heart Battalion.

Jewish prisoners from the outer Dachau camps were marched to Dachau, and then 70 miles south. Many of the Jewish marchers weighed less than 80 pounds. Shivering in their tattered striped uniforms, the &quot;skeletons&quot; marched 10 to 15 hours a day, passing more than a dozen Bavarian towns. If they stopped or fell behind, the SS guards shot them and left their corpses along the road. Thousands died from exposure, exhaustion, and starvation. On May 2, the death march was outside Waakirchen, Germany, near the Austrian border, when the 522nd came across the marchers. That day, soldiers from the 522nd were patrolling near Waakirchen. The Nisei saw an open field with several hundred &quot;lumps in the snow&quot;. When the soldiers looked closer they realized the &quot;lumps&quot; were people. Some were shot. Some were dead from exposure. Hundreds were alive. But barely. The 522nd discovered hundreds of prisoners with black and white prison garb, shaven heads, sunken eyes, and hollowed cheeks. Some roamed aimlessly around the countryside. Some were too weak to move. All were severely malnourished. One soldier gave a starving Jewish prisoner a candy bar, but his system couldn't handle solid food. Then the Americans were told not to give food to the prisoners because it could do them more harm than good. For the next three days, the Nisei helped the prisoners to shelter and tended to their needs as best as they could. They carried the survivors into warm houses and barns. The soldiers gave them blankets, water and tiny bits of food to ease them back from starvation. The soldiers left Waakirchen on May 4, still deeply disturbed by the harrowing scenes of the Jewish prisoners.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/search/results/?q=Waakirchen|title=Search Results|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.

As early as September 1931, with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, US officials began to compile lists of individuals, particularly focused on the Issei.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kashima2003&quot;/&gt;{{rp|16}} These data were eventually included in the [[Custodial Detention index]] (CDI). Agents in the Department of Justice's Special Defense Unit classified the subjects into three groups: A, B, and C, with A being &quot;most dangerous&quot;, and C being &quot;possibly dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial_detention_/_A-B-C_list/ |title=Custodial detention / A-B-C list |work=densho.org |author=Tetsuden Kashima |access-date=September 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Pearl Harbor attack, Roosevelt authorized his attorney general to put into motion a plan for the arrest of thousands of individuals on the potential enemy alien lists, most of them were Japanese-American community leaders. Armed with a blanket arrest warrant, the FBI seized these men on the eve of December 8, 1941. These men were held in municipal jails and prisons until they were moved to Department of Justice detention camps, separate from those of the Wartime Relocation Authority (WRA). These camps operated under far more stringent conditions and were subject to heightened criminal-style guards, despite the absence of criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kashima2003&quot;/&gt;{{rp|43-66}} Memoirs about the camps include those by [[Keiho Soga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebehindbarbed00soga_0 |title=Life Behind Barbed Wire: The World War II Internment Memoirs of a Hawaiʻi Issei |publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press |location=Honolulu |author=Keiho Soga |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toru Matsumoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brother is a Stranger |publisher=John Day Company |location=New York |author=Toru Matsumoto |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal City, Texas]], was one such camp where Japanese Americans, [[German-American internment|German Americans]], [[Italian-American internment|Italian Americans]], and a large number of U.S.-seized, [[Axis powers|Axis]]-descended nationals from several Latin-American countries were interned.&lt;ref name=texasarchive /&gt;&lt;ref name=jla/&gt;

The Canadian government also confined [[Japanese Canadians|its citizens with Japanese ancestry]] during World War II (see [[Japanese-Canadian internment|Japanese Canadian internment]]), for much the same reasons of fear and prejudice. Some Latin American countries of the Pacific Coast, such as Peru, interned ethnic Japanese or sent them to the United States for internment.&lt;ref name=jla/&gt; Brazil also [[Japanese Brazilian#Prejudice and forced assimilation|restricted]] its [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese Brazilian]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], &quot;Peru sorry for WWII internments&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', June 16, 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawaii===
Although [[Japanese in Hawaii|Japanese Americans in Hawaii]] comprised more than one-third of the population, businessmen resisted them being interned or deported to mainland concentration camps, as they recognized their contributions to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The territorial governor of Hawaii, Joseph B. Poindexter, was more measured. He provided statistics indicating that 34 percent of the islands' population was aliens, or citizens of Japanese descent.&quot; Frank, Richard B. &quot;Zero Hour on Niihau,&quot; ''World War II'', 24: 2 (July 2009) p54.&lt;/ref&gt; In the hysteria of the time, some mainland Congressmen (Hawaii was only an [[Territories of the United States#Incorporated and unincorporated territories|incorporated U.S. territory]] at the time, and despite being fully part of the U.S., did not have a voting representative or senator in Congress) promoted that all [[Japanese Americans]] and Japanese immigrants should be removed from Hawaii but were unsuccessful. An estimated 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese nationals and American-born Japanese from Hawaii were interned, either in five camps on the islands or in one of the mainland internment camps, but this represented well-under two percent of the total Japanese American residents in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/reports-to-the-legislature/2008/2008/shpd/HP08-Japanese-Internment-Camp%20-Act163SLH07.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527114752/http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/reports-to-the-legislature/2008/2008/shpd/HP08-Japanese-Internment-Camp%20-Act163SLH07.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2010 |title=Japanese Internment Camps In Hawaii |access-date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;No serious explanations were offered as to why ... the internment of individuals of Japanese descent was necessary on the mainland, but not in Hawaii, where the large Japanese-Hawaiian population went largely unmolested.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. Behind the Wire&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Japanese Americans and their immigrant parents in Hawaii were not interned because the government had already declared [[martial law]] in Hawaii and this allowed it to significantly reduce the supposed risk of espionage and sabotage by residents of Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref name=Scheiber&gt;Jane L. Scheiber, Harry N. Scheiber. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Martial%20law%20in%20Hawaii/ &quot;Martial law in Hawaii,&quot;] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved July 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Japanese Americans comprised over 35% of the territory's population, with 157,905 of Hawaii's 423,330 inhabitants at the time of the 1940 census,&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Campbell and Kay, Jung. Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990&lt;/ref&gt; making them the largest ethnic group at that time; detaining so many people would have been enormously challenging in terms of logistics. Additionally, the whole of Hawaiian society was dependent on their productivity. According to intelligence reports at the time, &quot;the Japanese, through a concentration of effort in select industries, had achieved a virtual stranglehold on several key sectors of the economy in Hawaii,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Okihiro, Gary. ''Cane Fires: The Anti-Japanese Movement in Hawaii, 1865–1945''. Temple University Press, 1st edition (January 8, 1992) p117.&lt;/ref&gt; and they &quot;had access to virtually all jobs in the economy, including high-status, high-paying jobs (e.g., professional and managerial jobs)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Aimee. &quot;Long-Run Labor Market Effects of Japanese American Internment During World War II on Working-Age Male Internees,&quot; ''Journal of Labor Economics'', University of Houston (2004) p10.&lt;/ref&gt; To imprison such a large percentage of the islands' work force would have crippled the Hawaiian economy. Thus, the unfounded fear of Japanese Americans turning against the United States was overcome by the reality-based fear of massive economic loss.

Lieutenant General [[Delos C. Emmons]], commander of the Hawaii Department, promised the local Japanese-American community that they would be treated fairly so long as they remained loyal to the United States. He succeeded in blocking efforts to relocate them to the outer islands or mainland by pointing out the logistical difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guarding the United States and Its Outposts|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WH-Guard/USA-WH-Guard-8.html|work=United States Army in World War II|publisher=United States Army Center of Military History|access-date=November 7, 2011|author=Stetson Conn |author2=Rose C.

The first group of Japanese Latin Americans arrived in San Francisco on April 20, 1942, on board the ''Etolin'' along with 360 ethnic Germans and 14 ethnic Italians from Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.&lt;ref name='Gardiner.25-29'&gt;C. Harvey Gardiner. ''Pawns in a Triangle of Hate: The Peruvian Japanese and the United States'' (University of Washington Press: Seattle, 1981), 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The 151 men — ten from Ecuador, the rest from Peru — had volunteered for deportation believing they were to be repatriated to Japan. They were denied visas by U.S. Immigration authorities and then detained on the grounds they had tried to enter the country illegally, without a visa or passport.&lt;ref name='Gardiner.25-29'/&gt; Subsequent transports brought additional &quot;volunteers&quot;, including the wives and children of men who had been deported earlier. A total of 2,264 Japanese Latin Americans, about two-thirds of them from Peru, were interned in facilities on the U.S. mainland during the war.&lt;ref name=niiya/&gt;&lt;ref name='Mak'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connel, Thomas. ''America's Japanese Hostages'': 2002, pp. 145–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States originally intended to trade these Latin American internees as part of a hostage exchange program with Japan and other Axis nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/manz/ccdoj.htm &quot;Department of Justice and U.S. Army Facilities&quot;], [[U.S. National Park Service]]. Retrieved August 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A thorough examination of the documents shows at least one trade occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt; Over 1,300 persons of Japanese ancestry were exchanged for a like number of non-official Americans in October 1943, at the port of [[Marmagao|Marmagao, India]]. Over half were Japanese Latin Americans (the rest being ethnic Germans and Italians) and of that number one-third were Japanese Peruvians.

On September 2, 1943, the Swedish ship ''[[MS Gripsholm]]'' departed the U.S. with just over 1,300 Japanese nationals (including nearly a hundred from Canada and Mexico) en route for the exchange location, [[Marmagao]], the main port of the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]] on the west coast of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Table 13-1}}&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book |title=Japanese-American civilian prisoner exchanges and detention camps, 1941–45 |last=Elleman |first=Bruce |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33188-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/japaneseamerican00elle_0 |url-access=registration |access-date=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two more stops in South America to take on additional Japanese nationals, the passenger manifest reached 1,340.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt; Of that number, Latin American Japanese numbered 55 percent of the Gripsholm's travelers, 30 percent of whom were Japanese Peruvian.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt; Arriving in Marmagao on October 16, 1943, the Gripsholm's passengers disembarked and then boarded the Japanese ship ''[[MS Aramis|Teia Maru]].'' In return, &quot;non-official&quot; Americans (secretaries, butlers, cooks, embassy staff workers, etc.) previously held by the Japanese Army boarded the ''Gripsholm'' while the ''Teia Maru'' headed for Tokyo.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt; Because this exchange was done with those of Japanese ancestry officially described as &quot;volunteering&quot; to return to Japan, no legal challenges were encountered. The U.S. Department of State was pleased with the first trade and immediately began to arrange a second exchange of non-officials for February 1944. This exchange would involve 1,500 non-volunteer Japanese who were to be exchanged for 1,500 Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt; The US was busy with Pacific Naval activity and future trading plans stalled. Further slowing the program were legal and political &quot;turf&quot; battles between the State Department, the Roosevelt administration, and the DOJ, whose officials were not convinced of the legality of the program.

The completed October 1943 trade took place at the height of the [[Enemy Alien Deportation Program]]. Japanese Peruvians were still being &quot;rounded up&quot; for shipment to the U.S. in previously unseen numbers. Despite logistical challenges facing the floundering prisoner exchange program, deportation plans were moving ahead. This is partly explained by an early-in-the-war revelation of the overall goal for Latin Americans of Japanese ancestry under the Enemy Alien Deportation Program. The goal: that the hemisphere was to be free of Japanese. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wrote an agreeing President Roosevelt, &quot;[that the US must] continue our efforts to remove all the Japanese from these American Republics for internment in the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OCLC 606835431&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, Secretary of State to President Roosevelt, 740.00115 European War 1939/4476, PS/THH, August 27, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Native&quot; Peruvians expressed extreme animosity toward their Japanese citizens and expatriates, and Peru refused to accept the post-war return of Japanese Peruvians from the US. Although a small number asserting special circumstances, such as marriage to a non-Japanese Peruvian,&lt;ref name=niiya/&gt; did return, the majority were trapped. Their home country refused to take them back (a political stance Peru would maintain until 1950&lt;ref name='Mak'/&gt;), they were generally Spanish speakers in the Anglo US, and in the postwar U.S., the Department of State started expatriating them to Japan.

==Internment ends==
On December 18, 1944, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] handed down two decisions on the legality of the incarceration under Executive Order 9066. ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', a 6–3 decision upholding a Nisei's conviction for violating the military exclusion order, stated that, in general, the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast was constitutional. However, ''[[Ex parte Endo]]'' unanimously declared on that same day that loyal citizens of the United States, regardless of cultural descent, could not be detained without cause. In effect, the two rulings held that, while the eviction of American citizens in the name of military necessity was legal, the subsequent incarceration was not—thus paving the way for their release.

Having been alerted to the Court's decision, the Roosevelt administration issued Public Proclamation No. 21 the day before the ''Korematsu'' and ''Endo'' rulings were made public, on December 17, 1944, rescinding the exclusion orders and declaring that Japanese Americans could return to the West Coast the next month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imai-KvUS&quot;/&gt;

Although [[War Relocation Authority|WRA]] Director [[Dillon Myer]] and others had pushed for an earlier end to the incarceration, the Japanese Americans were not allowed to return to the West Coast until January 2, 1945, being postponed until after the November 1944 election, so as not to impede Roosevelt's reelection campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Brian |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt/ |title=Franklin D.

(For example, 20,000 were sent to [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagasawa|first1=Katherine|title=What happened to Chicago's Japanese neighborhood?|url=http://interactive.wbez.org/curiouscity/chicago-japanese-neighborhood/|access-date=14 August 2017|work=[[WBEZ]]|date=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The remaining population began to leave the camps to try to rebuild their lives at home. Former inmates were given $25 and a train ticket to their pre-war places of residence, but many had little or nothing to return to, having lost their homes and businesses. When Japanese Americans were sent to the camps they could only take a few items with them and while incarcerated they could only work for meager jobs with a small monthly salary of $12-$19. So when internment ended Japanese Americans not only couldn't return to their homes and businesses but they had little to nothing to survive on, let alone enough to start a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearson|first=Bradford|date=2020-08-20|title=For Japanese-Americans, Housing Injustices Outlived Internment|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/magazine/japanese-internment-end-wwii-trailer-parks.html|access-date=2020-10-23|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some emigrated to Japan, although many of these individuals were &quot;repatriated&quot; against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/202_tulelakefeature.html|title=PBS Investigations of the Tule Lake Camp.

Nine of the ten WRA camps were shut down by the end of 1945, although Tule Lake, which held &quot;renunciants&quot; slated for deportation to Japan, was not closed until March 20, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Japanese Americans Internment Camps During World War II,&quot; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070619073757/http://www.lib.utah.edu/spc/photo/9066/9066.htm Library web page at Utah.edu].

Many internees lost irreplaceable personal property due to restrictions that prohibited them from taking more than they could carry into the camps. These losses were compounded by theft and destruction of items placed in governmental storage. Leading up to their incarceration, [[Japanese_diaspora#Terminology|Nikkei]] were prohibited from leaving the Military Zones or traveling more than {{convert|5|mi}} from home, forcing those who had to travel for work, like truck farmers and residents of rural towns, to quit their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist8/intern1.html &quot;Enemy Alien Curfew Friday: German, Japs, Italians in New Restrictions&quot;] (March 24, 1942), ''The San Francisco News''.

Many had cultivated land for decades as [[tenant farmer]]s, but they lost their rights to farm those lands when they were forced to leave. Other Issei (and Nisei who were renting or had not completed payments on their property) had found families willing to occupy their homes or tend their farms during their incarceration. However, those unable to strike a deal with caretakers had to sell their property, often in a matter of days and at great financial loss to predatory land speculators, who made huge profits.

In addition to these monetary and property losses, a number of people died or suffered from a lack of medical care in camp. Seven were shot and killed by sentries: Kanesaburo Oshima, 58, during an escape attempt from Fort Sill, Oklahoma; [[Lordsburg Killings|Toshio Kobata, 58, and Hirota Isomura, 59]], during transfer to Lordsburg, New Mexico; James Ito, 17, and Katsuji James Kanegawa, 21, during the December 1942 [[Manzanar#Resistance|Manzanar Riot]]; James Hatsuaki Wakasa, 65, while walking near the perimeter wire of Topaz; and Shoichi James Okamoto, 30, during a verbal altercation with a sentry at the Tule Lake Segregation Center.&lt;ref&gt;Kashima, Tetsuden.

Psychological injury was observed by [[Dillon S. Myer]], director of the WRA camps.

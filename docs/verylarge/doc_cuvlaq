In 1944, the US and Mexico signed a treaty regarding the river. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bibliography on Water Resources and International Law: Rio Grande|url=http://www.ppl.nl/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=82|publisher=Peace Palace Library|access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to drought conditions which have prevailed throughout much of the 21st century, calls for a reexamination of this treaty have been called for by locals in New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Texas, being the state with the least amount of control over the waterway, has routinely seen an under provision of water since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Yardley|first=Jim|date=2002-04-19|title=Water Rights War Rages on Faltering Rio Grande|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/19/us/water-rights-war-rages-on-faltering-rio-grande.html|access-date=2020-05-31|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The United States and Mexico share the water of the river under a series of agreements administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), US-Mexico. The most notable of these treaties were signed in 1906 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html IBWC: Treaties Between the U.S. and Mexico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601081248/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html |date=June 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Olivia N., [http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1315&amp;context=arp &quot;Binational Water Management: Perspectives of Local Texas Officials in the U.S.-Mexico Border Region&quot;] (2009). Applied Research Projects. Texas State University. Paper 313.{{Specify|page number - the drainage+endorheic area does not appear to be in the paper|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBWC traces its institutional roots to 1889, when the International Boundary Committee was established to maintain the border.  The IBWC today also allocates river waters between the two nations, and provides for flood control and water sanitation.

Use of that water belonging to the United States is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The water of the Rio Grande is over-appropriated: that is, more users for the water exist than water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse, the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/09/smn.08.html &quot;Rio Grande Sucked Dry for Irrigation, Industry&quot;], CNN Saturday Morning News, (Aired June 9, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rio Grande EP Upper Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Rio Grande in [[west El Paso]] near the New Mexico state line]]
Dams on the Rio Grande include [[Rio Grande Dam]], [[Cochiti Dam]], [[Elephant Butte Dam]], [[Caballo Dam]], [[Amistad Dam]], [[Falcon Dam]], [[Anzalduas Dam]], and [[Retamal Dam]]. In southern New Mexico and the upper portion of the Texas border segment, the river's [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] dwindles. Diversions, mainly for agricultural irrigation, have increased the natural decrease in flow such that by the time the river reaches [[Presidio, Texas|Presidio]], little or no water is left. Below Presidio, the Rio Conchos restores the flow of water.&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt; Near Presidio, the river's discharge is frequently zero. Its average discharge is {{convert|178|cuft/s|m3/s|0}}, down from {{convert|945|cuft/s|m3/s|0}} at Elephant Butte Dam. Supplemented by other tributaries, the Rio Grande's discharge increases to its maximum annual average of {{convert|3504|cuft/s|m3/s|0}} near Rio Grande City. Large diversions for irrigation below Rio Grande City reduce the river's average flow to {{convert|889|cuft/s|m3/s|0}} at Brownsville and Matamoros.&lt;ref name=ibwc/&gt;

==Crossings==
{{main|List of crossings of the Rio Grande}}
The major international border crossings along the river are at [[Ciudad Juárez]] and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]; Presidio and Ojinaga; [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[Nuevo Laredo]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] and [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas|Reynosa]]; and Brownsville and Matamoros. Other notable border towns are the Texas/Coahuila pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].

==Names and pronunciation==
[[File:Rio grande in 1718.jpg|thumb|right|The Rio Grande (''Rio del Norte'') as mapped in 1718 by [[Guillaume de L'Isle]]]]

{{lang|es|Río Grande}} is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and {{lang|es|Río Grande del Norte}} means &quot;Great River of the North&quot;.  In [[English language|English]], Rio Grande is pronounced either {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|oʊ|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|n|d}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|oʊ|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɑː|n|d|eɪ}}.

In Mexico, it is known as {{lang|es|Río Bravo}} or {{lang|es|Río Bravo del Norte}}, {{wikt-lang|es|bravo}} meaning (among other things) &quot;furious&quot; or &quot;agitated&quot;.

Historically, the [[Puebloans|Pueblo]] and Navajo peoples also had names for the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo:

* ''mets'ichi chena'', [[Keresan languages|Keresan]], &quot;Big River&quot;
* {{lang|tew|posoge}}, [[Tewa language|Tewa]], &quot;Big River&quot;
* ''paslápaane'', [[Tiwa languages|Tiwa]], &quot;Big River&quot;
* {{lang|tow|hañapakwa}}, [[Jemez language|Towa]], &quot;Great Waters&quot;

The four Pueblo names likely antedated the [[History of New Mexico#Spanish exploration and colonization|Spanish ''entrada'']] by several centuries.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;Source for historical names: Carroll L. Riley, 1995, ''Rio del Norte'', University of Utah Press. {{ISBN|0-87480-496-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{spell-nv|Tó Baʼáadi}}, [[Navajo language|Navajo]], &quot;Female River&quot; (the direction south is female in Navajo cosmology)&lt;ref name=&quot;Y&amp;M&quot;&gt;For the spelling of Navajo terms: Young, Robert W &amp; William Morgan, Sr. ''The Navajo Language. A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary.'' University of New Mexico Press. Albuquerque, NM: 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|es|Rio del Norte}} was most commonly used for the upper Rio Grande (roughly, within the present-day borders of New Mexico) from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] times to the end of the Mexican period in the mid-19th century.  This use was first documented by the Spanish in 1582. Early American settlers in [[South Texas]] began to use the modern 'English' name Rio Grande.  By the late 19th century, in the United States, the name Rio Grande had become standard in being applied to the entire river, from [[Colorado]] to the sea.&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

By 1602, {{lang|es|Río Bravo}} had become the standard Spanish name for the lower river, below its confluence with the Rio Conchos.&lt;ref name=Riley/&gt;

==Tributaries==
{{Main|List of tributaries of the Rio Grande}}

The largest [[tributary]] of the Rio Grande by [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] is the Rio Conchos, which contributes almost twice as much water as any other. In terms of [[drainage basin]] size, the Pecos River is the largest.

'''Britpop''' was a mid-1990s [[United Kingdom|British]]-based music and culture movement that emphasised [[Britishness]]. It produced brighter, catchier [[alternative rock]], partly in reaction to the popularity of the darker lyrical themes of the US-led [[grunge]] music and to the UK's own [[shoegazing]] music scene. The movement brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British popular cultural]] movement, [[Cool Britannia]], which evoked the [[Swinging Sixties]] and the British [[guitar pop]] of that decade.

Britpop was a media-driven focus on bands which emerged from the [[independent music]] scene of the early 1990s. Although the term was viewed as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, its associated bands typically drew from the [[British pop music]] of the 1960s, [[glam rock]] and [[punk rock]] of the 1970s and [[indie pop]] of the 1980s.

The most successful bands linked with Britpop were [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], known as the movement's &quot;big four&quot;, although Suede and Pulp distanced themselves from the term. The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993–1997, and its peak years to be 1994–1995. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis (dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;) brought the movement to the forefront of the British press in 1995. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with [[Tony Blair]] and [[New Labour]] aligning themselves with the movement.

During the late 1990s, many Britpop acts began to falter commercially or break up, or otherwise moved towards new genres or styles. Commercially, Britpop lost out to [[teen pop]], led by acts such as [[the Spice Girls]], [[Boyzone]], [[Westlife]] and [[Britney Spears]], while artistically it segued into a [[post-Britpop]] [[Indie rock|indie]] movement characterised by bands such as [[Travis (band)|Travis]], [[Snow Patrol]] and [[Coldplay]].

Though Britpop is seen retrospectively as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre,&lt;ref name=Till/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/25/1058853189807.html|title=The great Britpop swindle|author=Michael Dwyer|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=25 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-summer-of-britpop-5347330.html|title=The summer of Britpop|author=Nick Hasted|website=Independent.co.uk|date=18 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the [[British pop music]] of the 1960s, [[glam rock]] and [[punk rock]] of the 1970s, and [[indie pop]] of the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur and Oasis drew from [[the Kinks]], early [[Pink Floyd]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively, while Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock, notably [[Wire (band)|Wire]]. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Harris|title=Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock|publisher=Da Capo Press|date=2004|page=202|isbn=030681367X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinks' [[Ray Davies]] and [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]] are sometimes advanced as the &quot;godfathers&quot; or &quot;grandfathers&quot; of Britpop.&lt;ref name=&quot;ray&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Professor Andy|last2=Stratton|first2=Professor Jon|title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ts-hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative rock acts from the [[Independent music|indie]] scene of the Eighties and early Nineties were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of [[the Smiths]] is common to the majority of Britpop artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, pg. 385&quot;&gt;Harris, pg. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madchester]] scene, fronted by [[the Stone Roses]], [[Happy Mondays]] and [[Inspiral Carpets]] (for whom Oasis's [[Noel Gallagher]] had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based [[shoegazing]] and American based [[grunge]] styles of music.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/britpop-ma0000002480|title= Explore: Britpop|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-dating Britpop by four years, Liverpool based group [[the La's]] hit single &quot;[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]&quot; was described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as a &quot;founding piece of Britpop's foundation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=40 Greatest One-Album Wonders: 13.

Local identity and regional British accents are common to Britpop groups, as well as references to British places and culture in lyrics and image.&lt;ref name=Till&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gC0JA6is7REC&amp;pg=PA90|author=Rupert Till|page=90|title=Pop Cult|chapter=In my beautiful neighbourhood: local cults of popular music|publisher=A&amp;C Black|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation.&lt;ref name=allmusic /&gt; Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having nothing to say about their lives. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by &quot;youthful exuberance and desire for recognition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/britpop-ma0000002480 |title=Britpop |website=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damon Albarn]] of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an &quot;anti-grunge band&quot; he said, &quot;Well, that's good.

Noel Gallagher has since championed [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and once stated that [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] was the only songwriter he had respect for in the last ten years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written &quot;[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matthew Caws|title= Top of the Pops|journal=Guitar World|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, Oasis's prominence was such that ''NME'' termed a number of Britpop bands (including [[the Boo Radleys]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]] and [[Cast (band)|Cast]]) &quot;Noelrock&quot;, citing Gallagher's influence on their music.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Ted. &quot;Noelrock!&quot; ''NME''. 8 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] typified these bands, and Gallagher, of sharing &quot;a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock's most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of 'real music'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imagery associated with Britpop was equally British and working class. A rise in unabashed maleness, exemplified by ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'' magazine and [[lad culture]] in general, would be very much part of the Britpop era. The [[Union Jack]] became a prominent symbol of the movement (as it had a generation earlier with [[mod (subculture)|mod]] bands such as [[the Who]]) and its use as a symbol of pride and nationalism contrasted deeply with the controversy that erupted just a few years before when former Smiths singer [[Morrissey]] performed draped in it.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on British reference points made it difficult for the genre to achieve success in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Reynolds|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D81139F931A15753C1A963958260&amp;scp=31&amp;sq=Britpop&amp;st=nyt|title= RECORDINGS VIEW; Battle of the Bands: Old Turf, New Combatants|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Harris has suggested that Britpop began when Blur's single &quot;[[Popscene]]&quot; and Suede's &quot;[[The Drowners]]&quot; were released around the same time in the spring of 1992. He stated, &quot;[I]f Britpop started anywhere, it was the deluge of acclaim that greeted Suede's first records: all of them audacious, successful and very, very British&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Party: Britpop, Blair and the Demise of English Rock''; John Harris; Harper Perennial; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Suede were the first of the new crop of guitar-orientated bands to be embraced by the UK music media as Britain's answer to Seattle's grunge sound. Their debut album ''[[Suede (album)|Suede]]'' became the fastest-selling debut album in the history of the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;British alt-rock&quot;&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

Blur were involved in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed &quot;[[The Scene That Celebrates Itself]]&quot; by ''[[Melody Maker]]'') that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled [[shoegazing]], while others would go on to be part of Britpop.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by the Stone Roses' inactivity.&lt;ref name=liveforever&gt;''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop''. Passion Pictures. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' (1993). Their new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman [[Damon Albarn]] began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture's influence seeping into Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;liveforever&quot; /&gt; [[Justine Frischmann]], formerly of Suede and leader of [[Elastica]] (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, &quot;Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; John Harris wrote in an ''NME'' article just prior to the release of ''Modern Life is Rubbish'', &quot;[Blur's] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labeled 'yesterday's thing'&quot;.&lt;ref name=shite /&gt; The music press also fixated on what the ''[[NME]]'' had dubbed the [[New Wave of New Wave]], a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, [[S*M*A*S*H]] and [[These Animal Men]].

While ''Modern Life Is Rubbish'' was a moderate success, it was Blur's third album ''[[Parklife]]'' that made them arguably the most popular band in the UK in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;British alt-rock&quot; /&gt; ''Parklife'' continued the fiercely British nature of its predecessor, and coupled with the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in April of that year British alternative rock became the dominant rock genre in the country. That same year Oasis released their debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', which broke Suede's record for fastest-selling debut album; it went on to be certified 7× Platinum (2.1&amp;nbsp;million sales) by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British alt-rock&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/Search.aspx |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |title=Certified Awards Search |access-date=9 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040853/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Blur won four awards at the [[1995 Brit Awards]], including Best British Album for ''Parklife'' (ahead of ''Definitely Maybe'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1995 |title=The BRITs 1995 |publisher=The BRIT Awards |access-date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Pulp released the album ''[[Different Class]]'' which reached number one, and included the single &quot;[[Common People]]&quot;.

The term &quot;Britpop&quot; arose when the media were drawing on the success of British designers and films, the [[Young British Artists]] (sometimes termed &quot;Britart&quot;) such as [[Damien Hirst]], and on the mood of optimism with the decline of [[John Major]]'s government, and the rise of the youthful [[Tony Blair]] as leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name = britart&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30NDj3_0wmMC&amp;pg=PA53|page=53|title=The British Pop Dandy: Masculinity, Popular Music and Culture|author=Stan Hawkins|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After terms such as &quot;The New Mod&quot; and &quot;Lion Pop&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000m8w0|title=The Battle of Britpop : 25 Years On|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=3 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiiineon.com/blog/interview-cud/|title=INTERVIEW: Cud|website=Shiiineon.com|date=16 January 2018|access-date=3 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; were used in the press around 1992, journalist (and now [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] DJ) [[Stuart Maconie]] used the term Britpop in 1993 (though recounting the event in a BBC Radio 2 programme from 2020, he believed it may have been used in the 1960s, around the time of the [[British Invasion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000m447|title=The Britpop Top 50 with Jo Whiley|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=3 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However journalist and musician [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]] states he had used the term in the late 1980s in ''Sounds'' magazine to refer to bands such as [[the La's]], [[the Stone Roses]], and [[Inspiral Carpets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='I had no idea they would be so big' – John Robb on Manchester music, Britpop, and being the first to interview Nirvana |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/people/i-no-idea-big-john-robb-manchester-music-britpop-first-interview-nirvana/ |access-date=23 June 2019 |website=Inews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many of these acts would be grouped under the [[Baggy]], [[Madchester]] and indie-dance genres at the time.

A chart battle between Blur and Oasis, dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;, brought Britpop to the forefront of the British press in 1995. The bands had initially praised each other but over the course of the year antagonisms between the two increased.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Andy. &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;.

The battle pitted the two bands against each other, with the conflict as much about British class and regional divisions as it was about music.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Oasis were taken as representing the North of England, while Blur represented the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;liveforever&quot; /&gt; The event caught the public's imagination and gained mass media attention in national newspapers, [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], and television news. ''NME'' wrote about the phenomenon,

Oasis' third album ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite initially attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed ''Be Here Now'' as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage said that while the album &quot;isn't the great disaster that everybody says,&quot; he noted that &quot;[i]t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record&quot; of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;liveforever&quot; /&gt; At the same time, Blur sought to distance themselves from Britpop with their [[Blur (Blur album)|self-titled fifth album]],&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 321–22.&lt;/ref&gt; assimilating American [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] influences such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].

These two bands—in particular Radiohead—showed considerably more esoteric influences from the 1960s and 1970s that were uncommon among earlier Britpop acts. In 1997, Radiohead and the Verve released their respective albums ''[[OK Computer]]'' and ''[[Urban Hymns]]'', both widely acclaimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, p. 354&quot;/&gt; [[Post-Britpop]] bands such as [[Travis (band)|Travis]], [[Stereophonics]] and [[Coldplay]], influenced by Britpop acts, particularly Oasis, with more introspective lyrics, were some of the most successful rock acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pg. 369–70.&lt;/ref&gt;
